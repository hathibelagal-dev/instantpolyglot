        <h1>Uralic Languages</h1>
<p>The Uralic languages form a language family of about 38 languages spoken by approximately 25 million people. These languages are primarily spoken in Northern Eurasia, from Hungary in Central Europe across Scandinavia and the Russian Plain to Western and Northern Siberia.</p>
<h2>Major Branches and Languages</h2>
<p>The Uralic family is divided into two main branches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finno-Ugric</li>
<li>Samoyedic</li>
</ol>
<h3>Finno-Ugric Languages</h3>
<p>This is the larger of the two branches, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ugric languages:</li>
<li>Hungarian (about 13 million speakers)</li>
<li>Khanty (about 9,500 speakers)</li>
<li>
<p>Mansi (about 2,700 speakers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finnic languages:</p>
</li>
<li>Finnish (about 5.4 million speakers)</li>
<li>Estonian (about 1.1 million speakers)</li>
<li>Karelian (about 35,000 speakers)</li>
<li>Veps (about 3,600 speakers)</li>
<li>Ingrian (fewer than 100 speakers)</li>
<li>Votic (nearly extinct)</li>
<li>
<p>Livonian (extinct since 2013)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sami languages (about 30,000 speakers total):</p>
</li>
<li>Northern Sami</li>
<li>Inari Sami</li>
<li>Skolt Sami</li>
<li>Southern Sami</li>
<li>Lule Sami</li>
<li>Kildin Sami</li>
<li>
<p>Others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mordvinic languages:</p>
</li>
<li>Erzya (about 400,000 speakers)</li>
<li>
<p>Moksha (about 300,000 speakers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mari languages:</p>
</li>
<li>Meadow Mari (about 470,000 speakers)</li>
<li>
<p>Hill Mari (about 30,000 speakers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permic languages:</p>
</li>
<li>Udmurt (about 340,000 speakers)</li>
<li>Komi (about 220,000 speakers)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Samoyedic Languages</h3>
<p>This smaller branch includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nenets (about 44,000 speakers)</li>
<li>Nganasan (about 100 speakers)</li>
<li>Enets (about 40 speakers)</li>
<li>Selkup (about 1,000 speakers)</li>
</ol>
<p>Several Samoyedic languages are extinct, including Mator, Kamas, and Yurats.</p>
<h2>Historical Development</h2>
<p>The Uralic languages are believed to have originated in the vicinity of the Ural Mountains or Western Siberia around 4000-6000 years ago. From there, they spread westward to Europe and eastward into Siberia.</p>
<p>The relationship between Uralic languages was first proposed in the 17th century, with the Hungarian Jesuit János Sajnovics demonstrating the relationship between Hungarian and Sami in 1770.</p>
<h2>Common Features</h2>
<p>While Uralic languages have diverged significantly over time, they share several common features:</p>
<h3>Phonology</h3>
<ol>
<li>Vowel Harmony: Many Uralic languages exhibit vowel harmony, where vowels in a word must belong to the same class (usually front or back).</li>
</ol>
<p>Finnish example:
   - talo (house) - back vowels
   - kylä (village) - front vowels</p>
<p>Hungarian example:
   - asztal (table) - back vowels
   - ember (person) - front vowels</p>
<ol>
<li>Consonant Gradation: Some Uralic languages, particularly Finnic languages, display consonant gradation, where consonants alternate in strength depending on their phonological environment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finnish example:
   - katu (street) - nominative
   - kadun (of the street) - genitive</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of Voiced Stops: Proto-Uralic is reconstructed without voiced stops (b, d, g), a feature retained in many modern Uralic languages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finnish example:
   - pata (pot), not *bada</p>
<ol>
<li>Stress: Stress is typically fixed on the first syllable in many Uralic languages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finnish example:
   - 'ystävä (friend)</p>
<h3>Morphology</h3>
<ol>
<li>Agglutination: Uralic languages are highly agglutinative, meaning grammatical functions are expressed by adding suffixes to stems.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hungarian example:
   - ház (house)
   - házban (in the house)
   - házamban (in my house)</p>
<ol>
<li>Numerous Cases: Many Uralic languages have a large number of grammatical cases.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finnish has 15 cases, including:
   - Nominative: talo (house)
   - Genitive: talon (of the house)
   - Partitive: taloa (some of the house)
   - Inessive: talossa (in the house)
   - Elative: talosta (from the house)</p>
<ol>
<li>Possession: Possession is often indicated by suffixes rather than separate possessive pronouns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finnish example:
   - kirja (book)
   - kirjani (my book)
   - kirjasi (your book)</p>
<ol>
<li>Dual Number: Some Uralic languages, particularly Sami and Samoyedic languages, have a dual number in addition to singular and plural.</li>
</ol>
<p>Northern Sami example:
   - guolli (fish - singular)
   - guolit (fish - plural)
   - guollebáárat (two fish - dual)</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<ol>
<li>SOV or SVO Word Order: The original word order in Proto-Uralic is believed to have been Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), which is retained in some languages, while others have shifted to Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).</li>
</ol>
<p>Hungarian (SOV) example:
   - János almát eszik. (John apple-ACC eats - John eats an apple)</p>
<p>Finnish (SVO) example:
   - Juhani syö omenan. (John eats apple-ACC - John eats an apple)</p>
<ol>
<li>Postpositions: Uralic languages typically use postpositions rather than prepositions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Estonian example:
   - laua all (table under - under the table)</p>
<ol>
<li>Question Particles: Many Uralic languages use question particles rather than changing word order to form questions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finnish example:
   - Tuletko? (Come-you-Q - Are you coming?)</p>
<h2>Specific Features of Major Uralic Languages</h2>
<h3>Hungarian</h3>
<p>Hungarian, despite being geographically isolated from other Uralic languages, retains many typical Uralic features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vowel Harmony: Hungarian has front/back and rounded/unrounded vowel harmony.
   Example: </li>
<li>kertben (in the garden) - front vowels</li>
<li>
<p>házban (in the house) - back vowels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agglutination: Hungarian is highly agglutinative.
   Example:</p>
</li>
<li>szem (eye)</li>
<li>szemeim (my eyes)</li>
<li>
<p>szemeimben (in my eyes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cases: Hungarian has 18 cases.
   Examples:</p>
</li>
<li>Nominative: ház (house)</li>
<li>Accusative: házat (house-ACC)</li>
<li>Inessive: házban (in the house)</li>
<li>
<p>Superessive: házon (on the house)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definite and Indefinite Conjugations: Hungarian verbs have different conjugations depending on whether the object is definite or indefinite.
   Example:</p>
</li>
<li>Látok egy kutyát. (I see a dog - indefinite)</li>
<li>Látom a kutyát. (I see the dog - definite)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Finnish</h3>
<p>Finnish is known for its conservative nature, retaining many features of Proto-Uralic:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consonant Gradation: Finnish exhibits systematic consonant alternation.
   Example:</li>
<li>kukka (flower) - nominative</li>
<li>
<p>kukan (of the flower) - genitive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vowel Harmony: Finnish has front/back vowel harmony.
   Example:</p>
</li>
<li>talo (house) - back vowels</li>
<li>
<p>kylä (village) - front vowels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cases: Finnish has 15 cases.
   Examples:</p>
</li>
<li>Nominative: talo (house)</li>
<li>Partitive: taloa (some of the house)</li>
<li>
<p>Essive: talona (as a house)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>T-V Distinction: Finnish distinguishes between formal and informal second-person pronouns.</p>
</li>
<li>sinä (informal you)</li>
<li>te (formal you or plural you)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Estonian</h3>
<p>Estonian, while closely related to Finnish, has some distinct features:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Loss of Vowel Harmony: Unlike Finnish, Estonian has lost vowel harmony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three Degrees of Length: Estonian has three phonemic lengths for both consonants and vowels.
   Example:</p>
</li>
<li>lina (sheet) - short 'i'</li>
<li>linna (of the city) - long 'i'</li>
<li>
<p>liina (of the ribbon) - overlong 'i'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cases: Estonian has 14 cases, one fewer than Finnish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Future Tense: Estonian, like Finnish, lacks a grammatical future tense.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sami Languages</h3>
<p>The Sami languages, spoken in northern Scandinavia and northwestern Russia, have several unique features:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consonant Gradation: Sami languages have extensive consonant gradation systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dual Number: In addition to singular and plural, Sami languages have a dual number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidentiality: Some Sami languages have grammaticalized evidentiality, marking the source of information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Samoyedic Languages</h3>
<p>Samoyedic languages, spoken in Siberia, are the most divergent branch of Uralic:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Predicative Declension: Nouns can be inflected for person and number when used predicatively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objective Conjugation: Verbs agree not only with the subject but also with the object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extensive Use of Converbs: Samoyedic languages make extensive use of converbs (non-finite verb forms) in complex sentences.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lexicon</h2>
<p>Uralic languages share a core vocabulary, although many cognates are not immediately obvious due to regular sound changes. Some examples of common Uralic roots:</p>
<ol>
<li>'Fish':</li>
<li>Finnish: kala</li>
<li>Estonian: kala</li>
<li>Hungarian: hal</li>
<li>
<p>Northern Sami: guolli</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Water':</p>
</li>
<li>Finnish: vesi</li>
<li>Estonian: vesi</li>
<li>Hungarian: víz</li>
<li>
<p>Northern Sami: čáhci</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Name':</p>
</li>
<li>Finnish: nimi</li>
<li>Estonian: nimi</li>
<li>Hungarian: név</li>
<li>
<p>Northern Sami: namma</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Hand':</p>
</li>
<li>Finnish: käsi</li>
<li>Estonian: käsi</li>
<li>Hungarian: kéz</li>
<li>Northern Sami: giehta</li>
</ol>
<h2>Loanwords and Language Contact</h2>
<p>Uralic languages have been influenced by various neighboring languages throughout their history:</p>
<ol>
<li>Indo-European influence:</li>
<li>Baltic loanwords in Finnic (Finnish esim. 'halla' - frost, from Baltic)</li>
<li>Slavic loanwords in Hungarian (esim. 'széna' - hay, from Slavic)</li>
<li>
<p>Germanic loanwords in Finnic (Finnish esim. 'kuningas' - king, from Germanic)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turkic influence:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chuvash loanwords in Hungarian (esim. 'gyűrű' - ring, from Chuvash)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Russian influence on many Uralic languages spoken in Russia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swedish influence on Finnish</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Conversely, some Uralic languages have influenced their neighbors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finnish influence on Scandinavian languages</li>
<li>Hungarian influence on neighboring Slavic and Romance languages</li>
</ol>
<h2>Writing Systems</h2>
<p>Most Uralic languages use the Latin alphabet, often with additional letters or diacritics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hungarian: á, é, í, ó, ö, ő, ú, ü, ű</li>
<li>Finnish: ä, ö</li>
<li>Estonian: õ, ä, ö, ü</li>
</ol>
<p>Some Uralic languages spoken in Russia use the Cyrillic alphabet:</p>
<ol>
<li>Udmurt</li>
<li>Komi</li>
<li>Mari</li>
</ol>
<p>Historically, some Uralic languages used other writing systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Old Hungarian script (Hungarian runic script)</li>
<li>Ob-Ugric writings (used for religious purposes by the Khanty and Mansi)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Endangered Languages</h2>
<p>Many Uralic languages are endangered due to the small number of speakers and pressure from dominant languages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Votic: Nearly extinct, with only a handful of elderly speakers</li>
<li>Ingrian: Fewer than 100 speakers</li>
<li>Khanty and Mansi: Several thousand speakers each, but numbers are declining</li>
<li>Nganasan: About 100 speakers</li>
<li>Enets: About 40 speakers</li>
</ol>
<p>Efforts are being made to revitalize some of these languages through education and cultural programs.</p>
<h2>Language Policy and Standardization</h2>
<p>The status and standardization of Uralic languages vary significantly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hungarian, Finnish, and Estonian are official state languages with standardized written forms and used in all domains of life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sami languages have various degrees of official status in Scandinavia. Northern Sami, in particular, has a standardized written form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mari, Udmurt, and Komi have official status in their respective republics within Russia but face pressure from Russian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smaller languages often lack standardization and have limited use in official contexts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Uralic Languages in the Digital Age</h2>
<p>Uralic languages have adapted to modern technology to varying degrees:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Major languages (Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian) have full support in modern technology, including operating systems, mobile devices, and internet services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medium-sized languages (Northern Sami, Mari, Udmurt) have some digital presence, including websites and some software localization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smaller languages often have limited digital resources, although efforts are being made to increase their online presence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Linguistic Research</h2>
<p>Uralic languages have been the subject of extensive linguistic research:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Historical linguistics: Reconstruction of Proto-Uralic and the historical development of Uralic languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typology: Uralic languages provide important data for linguistic typology, particularly in the areas of case systems and agglutination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Language contact: The study of Uralic languages has contributed to our understanding of language contact phenomena, especially in Northern Eurasia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Endangered language documentation: There are ongoing efforts to document and describe endangered Uralic languages.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Unique Linguistic Features</h2>
<p>Some Uralic languages have developed unique features not typical of the family:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suffixaufnahme in Mari: Modifiers can take the case endings of the nouns they modify.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possessive Suffixes in Predicative Position in Samoyedic: Possessive suffixes can be used to mark the subject of a sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus Marking in Hungarian: Hungarian has a dedicated syntactic position for focused elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extensive Use of Participles in Finnish: Finnish uses participles in many constructions where other languages might use finite verb forms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
<p>Uralic languages are integral to the cultural identities of their speakers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Finnish and Hungarian have rich literary traditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sami languages are closely tied to traditional Sami culture and reindeer herding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many smaller Uralic languages play crucial roles in preserving traditional knowledge and practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Genetic Relationships</h2>
<p>The genetic relationship between Uralic speakers is a subject of ongoing research:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>While the linguistic relationship is clear, genetic studies have shown complex patterns of ancestry among Uralic speakers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some populations show genetic affinities with Siberian groups, while others are more closely related to their non-Uralic speaking neighbors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Proposed Macro-Families</h2>
<p>Some linguists have proposed broader genetic relationships for Uralic languages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ural-Altaic hypothesis: A now largely discredited theory that Uralic and Altaic languages are related.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uralo-Siberian hypothesis: A proposed grouping of Uralic, Yukaghir, and Eskimo-Aleut languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nostratic hypothesis: A controversial macro-family that would include Uralic along with Indo-European, Altaic, Dravidian, and other families.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These proposals remain contentious and are not widely accepted in the linguistic community.</p>
