| nj | [ɲ] | <strong>njuenie</strong> [ˈɲuenie] (nose) |</p>
<h3>Consonant Gradation</h3>
<p>South Sami exhibits consonant gradation, a phenomenon where consonants alternate between strong and weak forms depending on their position in the word and the surrounding sounds. This process affects both the pronunciation and the spelling of words. Here are some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>k/g</strong> alternation:</li>
<li>
<p><strong>låhkoe</strong> [ˈlɔhkoe] (number) → <strong>låhgoeh</strong> [ˈlɔhgoeh] (numbers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>p/b</strong> alternation:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>tjåepieh</strong> [ˈtʃɔepieh] (stomach) → <strong>tjåebien</strong> [ˈtʃɔebien] (stomach's)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>t/d</strong> alternation:</p>
</li>
<li><strong>gåetie</strong> [ˈgɔetie] (house) → <strong>gåetien</strong> [ˈgɔetien] (house's)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Stress</h3>
<p>In South Sami, stress typically falls on the first syllable of a word. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>bïenje</strong> [ˈbɨeɲe] (dog)</li>
<li><strong>gåetiesne</strong> [ˈgɔetiesne] (in the house)</li>
<li><strong>båatsoeburrie</strong> [ˈbɔatsoeburrie] (reindeer herder)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, in compound words, there may be secondary stress on the first syllable of the second element:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>juhteme</strong>/<strong>gåetie</strong> [ˈjuhtemeˌgɔetie] (mobile home, lit. "moving house")</li>
</ul>
<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>South Sami is an agglutinative language, meaning that grammatical functions are primarily expressed through the addition of suffixes to word stems. This results in complex word forms that can convey a lot of information.</p>
<h3>Nouns</h3>
<p>Nouns in South Sami are inflected for number (singular and plural) and case. There are seven cases in South Sami:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nominative</li>
<li>Accusative</li>
<li>Genitive</li>
<li>Illative</li>
<li>Inessive</li>
<li>Elative</li>
<li>Comitative</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's an example of the noun <strong>gåetie</strong> (house) declined in all cases and numbers:</p>
<p>| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | <strong>gåetie</strong> | <strong>gåetieh</strong> |
| Accusative | <strong>gåetiem</strong> | <strong>gåetieh</strong> |
| Genitive | <strong>gåetien</strong> | <strong>gåetiej</strong> |
| Illative | <strong>gåatan</strong> | <strong>gåetide</strong> |
| Inessive | <strong>gåetesne</strong> | <strong>gåetine</strong> |
| Elative | <strong>gåeteste</strong> | <strong>gåetijste</strong> |
| Comitative | <strong>gåetine</strong> | <strong>gåetiejgujmie</strong> |</p>
<p>Note that some case forms may change the stem of the word due to consonant gradation or other phonological processes.</p>
<h4>Possessive Suffixes</h4>
<p>South Sami also uses possessive suffixes that are added to nouns to indicate possession. These suffixes agree with the person and number of the possessor:</p>
<p>| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | -me | -me |
| 2nd | -de | -de |
| 3rd | -se | -se |</p>
<p>For example:
- <strong>gåetieme</strong> (my house)
- <strong>gåetiede</strong> (your house)
- <strong>gåetiese</strong> (his/her house)
- <strong>gåetiemme</strong> (our house)
- <strong>gåetiede</strong> (your (pl.) house)
- <strong>gåetiese</strong> (their house)</p>
<h3>Adjectives</h3>
<p>Adjectives in South Sami agree with the noun they modify in number and case. They also have three degrees of comparison: positive, comparative, and superlative.</p>
<p>Here's an example with the adjective <strong>båeries</strong> (old):</p>
<p>| Degree | Form | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| Positive | <strong>båeries</strong> | <strong>båeries gåetie</strong> (old house) |
| Comparative | <strong>båarasåbpoe</strong> | <strong>båarasåbpoe gåetie</strong> (older house) |
| Superlative | <strong>båarasommes</strong> | <strong>båarasommes gåetie</strong> (oldest house) |</p>
<p>Adjectives are declined similarly to nouns. For example, the adjective <strong>stoerre</strong> (big) in different cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nominative: <strong>stoerre gåetie</strong> (big house)</li>
<li>Accusative: <strong>stoerre gåetiem</strong></li>
<li>Genitive: <strong>stoere gåetien</strong></li>
<li>Illative: <strong>stoere gåatan</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Pronouns</h3>
<p>South Sami has personal, demonstrative, interrogative, and relative pronouns. Here are the personal pronouns:</p>
<p>| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | <strong>manne</strong> | <strong>mijjieh</strong> |
| 2nd | <strong>datne</strong> | <strong>dijjieh</strong> |
| 3rd | <strong>dïhte</strong> | <strong>dah</strong> |</p>
<p>These pronouns are declined for case, similar to nouns. For example, the first person singular pronoun <strong>manne</strong> in different cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nominative: <strong>manne</strong></li>
<li>Accusative: <strong>mannem</strong></li>
<li>Genitive: <strong>mov</strong></li>
<li>Illative: <strong>munnjan</strong></li>
<li>Inessive: <strong>munnesne</strong></li>
<li>Elative: <strong>munneste</strong></li>
<li>Comitative: <strong>munnine</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Demonstrative pronouns in South Sami include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>daate</strong> (this)</li>
<li><strong>dïhte</strong> (that)</li>
<li><strong>doete</strong> (that over there)</li>
</ul>
<p>Interrogative pronouns include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>gie</strong> (who)</li>
<li><strong>mij</strong> (what)</li>
<li><strong>gusnie</strong> (where)</li>
<li><strong>gåessie</strong> (when)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Verbs</h3>
<p>Verbs in South Sami are highly inflected, showing distinctions in person, number, tense, mood, and aspect. The basic form of the verb is the infinitive, which typically ends in -<strong>dh</strong>.</p>
<h4>Person and Number</h4>
<p>Verbs agree with their subject in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, dual, plural). Here's an example with the verb <strong>vaedtsedh</strong> (to walk):</p>
<p>| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | <strong>vaadtsam</strong> | <strong>vaedtsien</strong> | <strong>vaedtsebe</strong> |
| 2nd | <strong>vaedtsah</strong> | <strong>vaedtseden</strong> | <strong>vaedtsede</strong> |
| 3rd | <strong>vaadtsa</strong> | <strong>vaedtsiejægan</strong> | <strong>vaedtsieh</strong> |</p>
<h4>Tense and Aspect</h4>
<p>South Sami verbs have several tenses and aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Present tense: <strong>Manne vaadtsam</strong> (I walk)</li>
<li>Past tense: <strong>Manne vaedtsim</strong> (I walked)</li>
<li>Perfect: <strong>Manne leam vaadtseme</strong> (I have walked)</li>
<li>Pluperfect: <strong>Manne lim vaadtseme</strong> (I had walked)</li>
<li>Future: <strong>Manne edtjem vaedtsedh</strong> (I will walk)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Mood</h4>
<p>South Sami has several moods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Indicative: <strong>Manne vaadtsam</strong> (I walk)</li>
<li>Imperative: <strong>Vaedtsieh!</strong> (Walk!)</li>
<li>Conditional: <strong>Manne vaedtsejim</strong> (I would walk)</li>
<li>Potential: <strong>Manne vaedtselim</strong> (I might walk)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Negation</h4>
<p>Negation in South Sami is expressed using a negative verb that carries the person and number inflections, while the main verb appears in a special connegative form:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Im vaedtseh</strong> (I don't walk)</li>
<li><strong>Ih vaedtseh</strong> (You don't walk)</li>
<li><strong>Ij vaedtseh</strong> (He/she doesn't walk)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Verb Types</h4>
<p>South Sami verbs can be categorized into different classes based on their conjugation patterns. Some common verb types include:</p>
<ol>
<li>e-stem verbs: <strong>vaedtsedh</strong> (to walk)</li>
<li>o-stem verbs: <strong>gåarodh</strong> (to sew)</li>
<li>a-stem verbs: <strong>dåeriedidh</strong> (to follow)</li>
<li>Contracted verbs: <strong>vuejnedh</strong> (to see)</li>
</ol>
<p>Each type has its own specific conjugation patterns.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>South Sami typically follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, although this can be flexible due to the case system. Here are some key aspects of South Sami syntax:</p>
<h3>Basic Sentence Structure</h3>
<p>A basic South Sami sentence might look like this:</p>
<p><strong>Nïejte bïenjem vuajna.</strong>
(The girl sees the dog.)</p>
<p>Here, <strong>nïejte</strong> (girl) is the subject in nominative case, <strong>bïenjem</strong> (dog) is the object in accusative case, and <strong>vuajna</strong> (sees) is the verb.</p>
<h3>Question Formation</h3>
<p>Questions in South Sami can be formed in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Using question words:
   <strong>Gie daate?</strong> (Who is this?)
   <strong>Mij datne darjoeh?</strong> (What are you doing?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By changing the intonation of a statement:
   <strong>Datne Saemien gïelem lïerh?</strong> (Are you learning the Sami language?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the question particle <strong>-goh</strong>:
   <strong>Båatah-goh?</strong> (Are you coming?)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Negation</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the verb section, negation in South Sami uses a negative verb:</p>
<p><strong>Im manne daajrah.</strong>
(I don't know.)</p>
<p>Here, <strong>im</strong> is the negative verb in first person singular, and <strong>daajrah</strong> is the main verb in connegative form.</p>
<h3>Subordinate Clauses</h3>
<p>South Sami uses various conjunctions to form subordinate clauses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>jis</strong> (if): <strong>Manne båatam jis maahtam.</strong> (I will come if I can.)</li>
<li><strong>guktie</strong> (how, that): <strong>Manne vuajnam guktie dïhte båata.</strong> (I see that he is coming.)</li>
<li><strong>ihke</strong> (because): <strong>Im båetieh ihke skiemtjes.</strong> (I'm not coming because I'm sick.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Postpositions</h3>
<p>South Sami uses postpositions rather than prepositions. These come after the noun they modify:</p>
<p><strong>Gåetien sisnie</strong> (inside the house)
<strong>Bïerjen bijjelen</strong> (over the mountain)</p>
<p>The noun before a postposition is usually in the genitive case.</p>
<h3>Possession</h3>
<p>Possession in South Sami can be expressed in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Using the genitive case:
   <strong>Nïejten gærja</strong> (The girl's book)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using possessive suffixes:
   <strong>Gåetiema</strong> (My house)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the verb <strong>utnedh</strong> (to have):
   <strong>Manne gærjam utnem.</strong> (I have a book.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Word Order in Complex Sentences</h3>
<p>While the basic word order in South Sami is SOV, in complex sentences with multiple clauses, the word order can be more flexible:</p>
<p><strong>Gosse bïerjese båatam, dellie gaajhkem vuajnam.</strong>
(When I come to the mountain, then I see everything.)</p>
<p>In this example, the temporal clause comes first, followed by the main clause.</p>
<h3>Topic-Comment Structure</h3>
<p>South Sami often uses a topic-comment structure, where the topic of the sentence is presented first, followed by a comment about it:</p>
<p><strong>Dïhte nïejte, dïhte lea mov voelpetje.</strong>
(That girl, she is my friend.)</p>
<h3>Relative Clauses</h3>
<p>Relative clauses in South Sami are often formed using the relative pronoun <strong>jïh</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Dïhte almetje jïh manne vuajnam, lea mov voelpetje.</strong>
(The person whom I see is my friend.)</p>
<h2>Vocabulary</h2>
<p>South Sami vocabulary reflects the traditional lifestyle and environment of the Sami people, with many words related to reindeer herding, nature, and traditional crafts. However, it has also adapted to modern life with loanwords and neologisms.</p>
<h3>Native Vocabulary</h3>
<p>Many basic words in South Sami are shared with other Uralic languages:</p>

<li><strong>guelie</strong> (fish)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kinship Terms</h3>
<p>South Sami has a complex system of kinship terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>aehtjie</strong> (father)</li>
<li><strong>tjidtjie</strong> (mother)</li>
<li><strong>aajja</strong> (grandfather)</li>
<li><strong>aahka</strong> (grandmother)</li>

<li><strong>åabpa</strong> (sister)</li>
<li><strong>maake</strong> (in-law)</li>
<li><strong>seasa</strong> (aunt)</li>
<li><strong>jyöne</strong> (uncle)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Loanwords</h3>
<p>Like all languages, South Sami has borrowed words from other languages, particularly from Scandinavian languages and more recently from English:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>skovle</strong> (school, from Swedish "skola")</li>
<li><strong>busse</strong> (bus)</li>
<li><strong>telefovne</strong> (telephone)</li>
<li><strong>vïnhtsove</strong> (window, from Old Norse "vindauga")</li>
<li><strong>kaaffe</strong> (coffee)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Neologisms</h3>
<p>To adapt to modern life, South Sami has created new words:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>gelliegïele</strong> (multilingual, literally "many-language")</li>
<li><strong>gïehtjelimmie</strong> (computer, literally "question-answerer")</li>
<li><strong>guvvieprïevie</strong> (email, literally "picture-letter")</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dialects and Variation</h2>
<p>While South Sami is considered a single language, there are some dialectal variations, primarily between the Norwegian and Swedish sides of the border. These differences are mostly in pronunciation and vocabulary, and do not typically hinder mutual understanding.</p>
<h3>Norwegian South Sami</h3>
<p>The Norwegian variety of South Sami is spoken in areas like Røros, Snåsa, and parts of Nordland. Some features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tendency to use more Norwegian loanwords</li>
<li>Slight differences in pronunciation of certain vowels</li>
</ul>
<h3>Swedish South Sami</h3>
<p>The Swedish variety is spoken in areas like Härjedalen and Jämtland. Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>More influence from Swedish in terms of loanwords</li>
<li>Some differences in consonant pronunciation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Generational Differences</h3>
<p>There are also some differences between older and younger speakers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Older speakers tend to use more traditional vocabulary and grammatical forms</li>
<li>Younger speakers may incorporate more loanwords from Norwegian, Swedish, or English</li>
<li>Some younger speakers may have a simplified grammatical system due to language attrition</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phonological Processes</h2>
<p>South Sami has several interesting phonological processes that affect the pronunciation and spelling of words:</p>
<h3>Vowel Harmony</h3>
<p>While not as extensive as in some Uralic languages, South Sami does exhibit some vowel harmony, particularly in suffixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The illative case ending can be <strong>-se</strong> or <strong>-an</strong> depending on the vowels in the stem:
  <strong>gåatese</strong> (into the house) vs. <strong>bïjlan</strong> (into the car)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consonant Gradation</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, South Sami has a system of consonant gradation. This process affects the strength of certain consonants depending on their position and the surrounding sounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>låhkoe</strong> (number) → <strong>låhgoen</strong> (number's)</li>
<li><strong>gåetie</strong> (house) → <strong>gåetien</strong> (house's)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assimilation</h3>
<p>Consonants often assimilate to surrounding sounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>The inessive case ending <strong>-sne</strong> becomes <strong>-nne</strong> after an <strong>n</strong>:
  <strong>gåetesne</strong> (in the house) but <strong>bïenjennie</strong> (on the dog)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Elision</h3>
<p>In some cases, vowels or consonants may be dropped in rapid speech:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ij leah</strong> (is not) may be pronounced as <strong>ïleah</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Writing System</h2>
<p>South Sami uses a Latin-based alphabet with some additional characters:</p>
<p>A Á B D E F G H I Ï J K L M N O Ö P R S T U V Y Æ Ø Å</p>
<p>The letters C, Q, W, X, and Z are not used in native South Sami words but may appear in loanwords.</p>
<p>The orthography is largely phonemic, meaning that there is generally a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds. However, there are some exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The letter combination <strong>nj</strong> represents a single sound [ɲ]</li>
<li>The letter <strong>g</strong> can represent both [g] and [j] depending on its position</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges in Language Preservation</h2>
<p>As an endangered language, South Sami faces several challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Small speaker population: With only a few hundred active speakers, it's challenging to maintain language vitality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of everyday use: Many South Sami speakers don't use the language daily, which can lead to language attrition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limited educational resources: While there are efforts to teach South Sami in schools, resources are often limited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Influence of majority languages: Norwegian and Swedish exert strong influence, leading to borrowing and code-switching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generational gap: Younger generations may not be learning the language as thoroughly as their elders.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite these challenges, there are ongoing efforts to revitalize and preserve South Sami:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language nests and immersion programs for children</li>
<li>Development of digital resources and apps for language learning</li>
<li>Production of literature and media in South Sami</li>
<li>Inclusion of South Sami in official contexts in Norway and Sweden</li>
</ul>
