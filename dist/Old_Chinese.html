        <h1>Old Chinese</h1>
<p>Old Chinese, also known as Archaic Chinese, is the oldest attested stage of Chinese and the ancestor of all modern varieties of Chinese. It was spoken during the early and middle Zhou dynasty (11th to 7th centuries BCE), and its latest stage extended to the early Han period (3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE). Old Chinese is not directly attested in any surviving texts, but it can be reconstructed through the study of later forms of Chinese, especially Middle Chinese, as well as through the analysis of phonetic components in Chinese characters and ancient poetry rhymes.</p>
<h2>Phonology</h2>
<p>The phonology of Old Chinese is complex and still a subject of ongoing research and debate among scholars. The following is a general overview based on widely accepted reconstructions.</p>
<h3>Syllable structure</h3>
<p>The basic syllable structure of Old Chinese is typically reconstructed as:</p>
<p>(C₁)(C₂)V(C₃)(ʔ/s)</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>C₁ is an optional initial consonant</li>
<li>C₂ is an optional medial glide</li>
<li>V is the main vowel (which may be followed by a glide)</li>
<li>C₃ is an optional final consonant</li>
<li>(ʔ/s) represents an optional post-coda glottal stop or *-s suffix</li>
</ul>
<h3>Initials</h3>
<p>Old Chinese had a rich system of initial consonants, including stops, affricates, nasals, liquids, and glides. Some reconstructions propose the following set of initials:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Labial</th>
  <th>Dental</th>
  <th>Palatal</th>
  <th>Velar</th>
  <th>Uvular</th>
  <th>Laryngeal</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>p pʰ b m</td>
  <td>t tʰ d n</td>
  <td>tɕ tɕʰ dʑ ɲ</td>
  <td>k kʰ g ŋ</td>
  <td>q qʰ ɢ</td>
  <td>ʔ h</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>ts tsʰ dz s z</td>
  <td>ɕ ʑ</td>
  <td>x ɣ</td>
  <td></td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>l r</td>
  <td>j</td>
  <td>w</td>
  <td></td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>方</strong> *pjaŋ (square)</li>
<li><strong>天</strong> *tʰin (sky)</li>
<li><strong>見</strong> *kens (to see)</li>
<li><strong>日</strong> *ɲit (sun)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finals</h3>
<p>The final system of Old Chinese included both short and long vowels, diphthongs, and various final consonants. Some reconstructed finals include:</p>
<p>Vowels: *a, *e, *i, *o, *u, *ə
Diphthongs: *ai, *au, *ei, *eu, *oi, *ou
Final consonants: *-p, *-t, *-k, *-m, *-n, *-ŋ, *-j, *-w</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>山</strong> *srjan (mountain)</li>
<li><strong>水</strong> *s.tujʔ (water)</li>
<li><strong>馬</strong> *mraːʔ (horse)</li>
<li><strong>魚</strong> *ŋa (fish)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tones</h3>
<p>Old Chinese is generally reconstructed without phonemic tones. The tonal system that characterizes Middle and Modern Chinese is believed to have developed from certain phonation types and final consonants in Old Chinese:</p>
<ol>
<li>Level tone: developed from syllables without *-ʔ or *-s</li>
<li>Rising tone: developed from syllables with *-ʔ</li>
<li>Departing tone: developed from syllables with *-s</li>
<li>Entering tone: developed from syllables ending in *-p, *-t, or *-k</li>
</ol>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>刀</strong> *taw &gt; Middle Chinese tāu (level tone)</li>
<li><strong>弟</strong> *dejʔ &gt; Middle Chinese tèj (rising tone)</li>
<li><strong>大</strong> *daːds &gt; Middle Chinese dàj (departing tone)</li>
<li><strong>十</strong> *dəp &gt; Middle Chinese dźip (entering tone)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phonological processes</h3>
<p>Several important phonological processes occurred in the transition from Old Chinese to Middle Chinese:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Palatalization: Dental consonants became palatal before high front vowels:</p>
<ul>
<li>*ti &gt; tɕi</li>
<li>*si &gt; ɕi</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Labialization: Velar consonants became labialized before rounded vowels:</p>
<ul>
<li>*ku &gt; kʷu</li>
<li>*ŋo &gt; ŋʷo</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Dentilabialization: Labial consonants before *-j became dentilabials:</p>
<ul>
<li>*pj &gt; pf</li>
<li>*bj &gt; bv</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Voicing alternation: Some words showed alternation between voiced and voiceless initials:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>見</strong> *kens (to see) vs. <strong>現</strong> *ɡens (to appear)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Grammar</h2>
<p>Old Chinese grammar differed significantly from Modern Chinese. It was more synthetic, with a greater use of inflections and fewer function words.</p>
<h3>Word order</h3>
<p>The basic word order in Old Chinese was Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), but there was considerable flexibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>王</strong> <strong>殺</strong> <strong>敵</strong> (*wjaŋ srats dək, &quot;The king killed the enemy&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Object-Verb (OV) order was also common, especially in poetry and formal prose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>之</strong> <strong>友</strong> (*tə ɢʷəʔ, &quot;befriend him&quot;, literally &quot;him befriend&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nouns</h3>
<p>Nouns in Old Chinese did not inflect for number or case. Plurality could be expressed through context or by using numerals and quantifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>人</strong> (*nin, &quot;person&quot; or &quot;people&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>三</strong> <strong>人</strong> (*sam nin, &quot;three people&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pronouns</h3>
<p>Personal pronouns in Old Chinese included:</p>
<p>1st person:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>吾</strong> *ŋa (I, me)</li>
<li><strong>我</strong> *ŋajʔ (I, me)</li>
<li><strong>朕</strong> *lrəmʔ (I, me - used by rulers)</li>
</ul>
<p>2nd person:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>汝</strong> *naʔ (you)</li>
<li><strong>爾</strong> *nəʔ (you)</li>
</ul>
<p>3rd person:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>其</strong> *gə (he, she, it)</li>
</ul>
<p>Demonstrative pronouns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>此</strong> *tʰjeʔ (this)</li>
<li><strong>彼</strong> *pjajʔ (that)</li>
</ul>
<p>Interrogative pronouns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>誰</strong> *dwjuj (who)</li>
<li><strong>何</strong> *gaj (what)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Verbs</h3>
<p>Verbs in Old Chinese did not inflect for person or number, but they could take various affixes to indicate aspect, mood, and voice.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Prefixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>*s- causative prefix:
<strong>見</strong> *kens (to see) &gt; <strong>視</strong> *s-kens (to show)</li>
<li>*N- intransitive/passive prefix:
<strong>折</strong> *tjat (to break something) &gt; <strong>枿</strong> *N-tjat (to break, become broken)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Infixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>*-r- iterative or distributive infix:
<strong>見</strong> *kens (to see) &gt; <strong>見</strong> *k-r-ens (to see repeatedly, to appear)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Suffixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>*-s perfective suffix:
<strong>取</strong> *tʰoʔ (to take) &gt; <strong>取</strong> *tʰo-s (to have taken)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>王</strong> <strong>來</strong> (*wjaŋ *rə̂ʔ, &quot;The king comes&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>王</strong> <strong>殺</strong> <strong>之</strong> (*wjaŋ *srat-s tə, &quot;The king killed him&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Particles</h3>
<p>Old Chinese used various particles to express grammatical relationships and mood:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Question particles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>乎</strong> *ɢa (general question marker)</li>
<li><strong>與</strong> *laʔ (yes/no question marker)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Negative particles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>不</strong> *pə (general negation)</li>
<li><strong>弗</strong> *pət (negation of future or habitual actions)</li>
<li><strong>莫</strong> *mak (prohibition)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Modal particles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>也</strong> *lajʔ (declarative)</li>
<li><strong>矣</strong> *ləjʔ (change of state)</li>
<li><strong>焉</strong> *ʔan (interrogative)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>子</strong> <strong>來</strong> <strong>乎</strong> (*tsəʔ *rə̂ʔ *ɢa, &quot;Are you coming?&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>吾</strong> <strong>不</strong> <strong>知</strong> (*ŋa *pə *tre, &quot;I don't know&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>王</strong> <strong>至</strong> <strong>矣</strong> (*wjaŋ *tits *ləjʔ, &quot;The king has arrived&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Aspect and tense</h3>
<p>Old Chinese did not have grammatical tense but used context and aspectual markers to indicate temporal relationships:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Perfect aspect: indicated by the *-s suffix or context</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>既</strong> <strong>食</strong> (*krəp *m-lək-s, &quot;having eaten&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Progressive aspect: often indicated by reduplication</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>行行</strong> (*ɡraŋ-ɡraŋ, &quot;walking and walking&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Future or habitual actions: often indicated by auxiliary verbs</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>將</strong> <strong>去</strong> (*tsaŋ *kʰra-s, &quot;will go&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Copula and existential verbs</h3>
<p>Old Chinese used several verbs to express existence and identity:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>是</strong> *dje (to be, copula)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>是</strong> <strong>為</strong> <strong>君子</strong> (*dje *wjaj *kun tsəʔ, &quot;This is being a gentleman&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>有</strong> *ɢʷəʔ (to have, there is/are)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>有</strong> <strong>虎</strong> (*ɢʷəʔ *qʰraʔ, &quot;There is a tiger&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>在</strong> *tsəʔ (to be at, to exist)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>赤</strong> <strong>狄</strong> <strong>在</strong> <strong>北</strong> (*tʰjak *dek *tsəʔ *pək, &quot;The Red Di are in the north&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Nominal predicates</h3>
<p>In Old Chinese, nouns could often function as predicates without a copula:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>國</strong> <strong>君</strong> (*kwək *kun, &quot;The ruler is the state&quot; or &quot;The state is the ruler&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Serial verb constructions</h3>
<p>Old Chinese made extensive use of serial verb constructions, where two or more verb phrases or clauses are strung together:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>出</strong> <strong>見</strong> <strong>客</strong> (*tʰut *kens *kʰrak, &quot;go out to see guests&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Topic-comment structure:
Old Chinese frequently used topic-comment structures, where the topic is introduced first, followed by a comment about it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>見</strong> <strong>賢</strong> <strong>思齊</strong> <strong>焉</strong> (*kens *ɡran *sə *dzij *ʔan, &quot;Seeing a worthy person, [one should] think to emulate [them]&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Relative clauses:
Relative clauses in Old Chinese typically preceded the noun they modified, without any overt relativizer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>所</strong> <strong>愛</strong> <strong>之</strong> <strong>物</strong> (*s-qʰra-q *ʔrats *tə *mət, &quot;the thing that [one] loves&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Comparative constructions:
Comparisons were often made using the verb <strong>如</strong> *na (to be like):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>智</strong> <strong>如</strong> <strong>泉</strong> (*trəs *na *dzwan, &quot;wisdom is like a spring&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Passive voice:
Passive meaning was often expressed through word order or context, rather than specific grammatical markers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>民</strong> <strong>可</strong> <strong>近</strong> (*mjin *kʰaːjʔ *gjin, &quot;The people can be approached&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Causative constructions:
Causatives were formed using prefixes or through verb serialization:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>使</strong> <strong>民</strong> <strong>以</strong> <strong>時</strong> (*s-rəʔ *mjin *ləʔ *də, &quot;cause the people to be timely&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lexicon</h2>
<p>The Old Chinese lexicon forms the basis of the modern Chinese vocabulary, though many words have undergone significant semantic shifts. Some characteristics of the Old Chinese lexicon include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Monosyllabic words:
Most Old Chinese words were monosyllabic, in contrast to the many disyllabic words in Modern Chinese:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>山</strong> *srjan (mountain)</li>
<li><strong>水</strong> *s.tujʔ (water)</li>
<li><strong>人</strong> *nin (person)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Polysemy:
Many Old Chinese words had multiple related meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>道</strong> *luː (road, way, method, to speak)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Word families:
Words with related meanings often shared phonetic elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>見</strong> *kens (to see)</li>
<li><strong>視</strong> *s-kens (to look at)</li>
<li><strong>現</strong> *ɡens (to appear)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Loan words:
Old Chinese borrowed words from neighboring languages, particularly for exotic items or concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>琴</strong> *grəm (a type of zither, possibly from Austro-Asiatic languages)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Abstract vocabulary:
Old Chinese had a rich vocabulary for abstract concepts, particularly in philosophy and governance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>道</strong> *luː (the Way, in Daoism)</li>
<li><strong>德</strong> *tək (virtue, moral power)</li>
<li><strong>仁</strong> *nin (benevolence, humaneness)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Technical terminology:
Specialized vocabularies existed for various fields such as astronomy, divination, and ritual:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>昴</strong> *muːɡs (the Pleiades constellation)</li>
<li><strong>卦</strong> *kreːds (hexagram in the I Ching)</li>
<li><strong>祭</strong> *tsəts (to sacrifice)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Honorific and humble language:
Old Chinese had specific terms for addressing or referring to people of different social statuses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>王</strong> *wjaŋ (king)</li>
<li><strong>公</strong> *koŋ (duke)</li>
<li><strong>臣</strong> *gin (minister, I [humble])</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Writing system</h2>
<p>The writing system used for Old Chinese was an early form of Chinese characters. This system evolved over time, with major developments occurring during the Old Chinese period:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Oracle bone script (甲骨文 *kraːp *kut *mən):
The earliest known form of Chinese writing, used primarily for divination records in the late Shang dynasty (c. 1250-1050 BCE).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bronze inscription script (金文 *krəm *mən):
Used for inscriptions on bronze vessels during the Shang and Zhou dynasties.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Seal script (篆書 *trwans *sje):
A more standardized script that developed during the late Zhou and Qin dynasties.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Characteristics of early Chinese writing:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pictographs:
Many early characters were simplified pictures of objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>日</strong> (sun): originally a circle with a dot inside</li>
<li><strong>月</strong> (moon): originally a crescent shape</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Ideographs:
Abstract concepts were represented by symbolic designs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>上</strong> (up): a horizontal line with a vertical stroke above it</li>
<li><strong>下</strong> (down): a horizontal line with a vertical stroke below it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Compound ideographs:
Combinations of simpler characters to represent more complex ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>明</strong> (bright): combining 日 (sun) and 月 (moon)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Phonetic loans:
Characters borrowed to write words with similar pronunciations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>來</strong> originally meant &quot;wheat&quot; but was borrowed to write &quot;to come&quot; (both pronounced *rə̂ʔ)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Phonetic-semantic compounds:
Characters composed of a semantic element (radical) and a phonetic element:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>河</strong> &quot;river&quot;: 氵(water radical) + 可 *kʰaːjʔ (phonetic element)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Character evolution:
Many characters underwent significant changes in form over time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>馬</strong> (horse): from a pictograph of a horse to the modern character</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Regional variations:
Different states often used variant forms of characters before standardization:</p>
<ul>
<li>The character for &quot;east&quot; (東) had several regional variants before the Qin unification</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Historical development</h2>
<p>The Old Chinese period saw significant linguistic changes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Initial consonant clusters:
Early Old Chinese had complex initial consonant clusters that gradually simplified:</p>
<ul>
<li>*sm- &gt; *m-</li>
<li>*st- &gt; *t-</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Final consonants:
Old Chinese preserved final consonants thatwere later lost or merged in Middle Chinese:</p>
<ul>
<li>*-p, *-t, *-k &gt; Middle Chinese entering tone</li>
<li>*-m, *-n, *-ŋ &gt; preserved in Middle Chinese</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Vowel system:
The Old Chinese vowel system underwent various shifts and mergers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of the *-j medial from certain vowel combinations</li>
<li>Merger of some vowel distinctions, e.g., *ə and *a in some environments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Tonal development:
The Old Chinese non-tonal system evolved into the tonal system of Middle Chinese:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syllables ending in *-ʔ &gt; rising tone</li>
<li>Syllables ending in *-s &gt; departing tone</li>
<li>Other syllables &gt; level tone or entering tone (for stops)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Grammaticalization:
Many function words in later Chinese developed from content words in Old Chinese:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>之</strong> *tə (originally a demonstrative) &gt; genitive particle</li>
<li><strong>於</strong> *ʔa (originally &quot;in, at&quot;) &gt; general locative preposition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Lexical replacement:
Some common Old Chinese words were replaced or became restricted in use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>谷</strong> *kloːk &quot;valley&quot; was largely replaced by 山谷 in later Chinese</li>
<li><strong>逆</strong> *ŋraːk &quot;to oppose&quot; became less common, with 反對 taking its place in many contexts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Dialects and variants</h2>
<p>While our knowledge of Old Chinese dialects is limited, there is evidence of regional linguistic diversity:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Chu dialect:
The state of Chu in the south had some distinctive features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of <strong>於</strong> *ʔa where northern dialects used <strong>乎</strong> *ɢa as a question particle</li>
<li>Vocabulary differences, e.g., <strong>雲</strong> *wən &quot;to say&quot; instead of northern <strong>曰</strong> *wat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Wu dialect:
The state of Wu in the lower Yangtze region had some characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possible preservation of some consonant clusters lost elsewhere</li>
<li>Lexical items like <strong>言</strong> *ŋan &quot;to speak&quot; where other regions used <strong>語</strong> *ŋaʔ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Qin dialect:
The state of Qin in the west, which eventually unified China, had features that influenced later standard Chinese:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possible early loss of some final consonants</li>
<li>Lexical items that became standard, e.g., <strong>犬</strong> *kʰʷens &quot;dog&quot; replacing earlier <strong>狗</strong> *koːʔ</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Yan dialect:
The state of Yan in the northeast may have had features that influenced later Mandarin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possible early weakening of final stops</li>
<li>Some unique vocabulary items, though evidence is limited</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Poetry and rhyming</h2>
<p>Poetry was a crucial aspect of Old Chinese literature, and the study of ancient rhymes has been invaluable in reconstructing Old Chinese phonology:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Rhyme books:
Later works like the <strong>切韻</strong> (Qieyun, 601 CE) preserve information about earlier rhyming practices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rhyme categories:
Old Chinese poetry used specific rhyme categories, which have been reconstructed as:</p>
<ul>
<li>*-a, *-o, *-u, *-ə, *-i, *-e</li>
<li>*-aj, *-aw, *-ej, *-ow</li>
<li>*-an, *-on, *-in</li>
<li>*-aŋ, *-oŋ, *-uŋ, *-əŋ</li>
<li>*-ak, *-ok, *-uk, *-ək</li>
<li>*-ap, *-op, *-əp</li>
<li>*-at, *-ot, *-ut, *-ət</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Rhyme patterns:
Different poetic forms had specific rhyme patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>詩經</strong> (Book of Odes) often used AAXA or AABA patterns</li>
<li>Later forms like the <strong>楚辭</strong> (Songs of Chu) had more complex patterns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Phonetic series:
Characters sharing the same phonetic component often rhymed in ancient poetry, providing clues to pronunciation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characters with the phonetic element 月 *ŋʷat (e.g., 月, 朒, 刖) often rhymed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Change over time:
Rhyming practices changed as the language evolved, providing evidence for sound changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Words that rhymed in early poetry stopped rhyming in later works, indicating sound shifts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Examples of Old Chinese texts</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>From the <strong>詩經</strong> (Book of Odes), Ode 关雎 (Guan Ju):</p>
<p><strong>關關雎鳩，在河之洲。</strong>
<strong>窈窕淑女，君子好逑。</strong></p>

<li><p>From the <strong>論語</strong> (Analects), 1.1:</p>
<p><strong>子曰：「學而時習之，不亦說乎？</strong>
<strong>有朋自遠方來，不亦樂乎？</strong>
<strong>人不知而不慍，不亦君子乎？」</strong></p>
<p>*tsəʔ *wat: &quot;ɡroːk *nə *də *zəp *tə, *pə *ʔjək *ljot *ɢa?
*ɢʷəʔ *bəŋ *zəʔ *ʔʷans *paŋ *rə̂ʔ, *pə *ʔjək *ŋraːk *ɢa?
*nin *pə *tre *nə *pə *ʔuns, *pə *ʔjək *kun *tsəʔ *ɢa?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Master said: 'To learn and timely practice what one has learned, is this not a pleasure?
To have friends come from afar, is this not a joy?
To remain unrecognized by others without resentment, is this not the mark of a gentleman?'&quot;</p>

*mjeŋ *kʰaːjʔ *mjeŋ, *pəj *daŋ *mjeŋ.</p>
<p>&quot;The Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Way.
The name that can be named is not the constant name.&quot;</p>

<p>These examples showcase various features of Old Chinese, including its grammar, vocabulary, and phonology. The reconstructed pronunciations are approximate and may vary depending on the specific reconstruction system used.</p>
<h2>Influence on later Chinese</h2>
<p>Old Chinese had a profound influence on the development of later forms of Chinese and neighboring languages:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Phonological evolution:
The sound changes from Old Chinese to Middle Chinese set the stage for the diverse phonological systems of modern Chinese dialects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grammatical simplification:
The gradual loss of morphological complexity in Old Chinese led to the more analytic grammar of Modern Chinese.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vocabulary foundation:
Many basic words in modern Chinese can be traced back to Old Chinese roots, though often with semantic shifts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Classical Chinese:
The written language based on Old Chinese continued to be used for formal writing until the early 20th century, influencing the modern written language.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Loan words in other languages:
Old Chinese words were borrowed into neighboring languages, such as Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese, often preserving archaic pronunciations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Character evolution:
The development of Chinese characters during the Old Chinese period laid the foundation for the writing systems used in China, Japan, Korea (historically), and Vietnam (historically).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Literary and philosophical legacy:
Texts written in Old Chinese, such as the Confucian classics and early Daoist works, continue to exert a strong influence on Chinese culture and thought.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, Old Chinese represents a crucial stage in the development of the Chinese language, providing insights into the origins of modern Chinese varieties and the evolution of East Asian languages and cultures. Its study remains vital for understanding Chinese linguistics, literature, and cultural history.</p>
