        <h1>Korean</h1>
<p>Korean (한국어 / 韓國語 Hangugeo) is the official language of both South Korea and North Korea, spoken by about 80 million people worldwide. It is a language isolate, meaning it has no proven genetic relationship with any other language, although some linguists propose it may be related to Japanese or the Altaic language family.</p>
<h2>Spelling and pronunciation</h2>
<p>Korean uses its own unique alphabet called Hangul (한글 Hangeul), which was invented in the 15th century. The alphabet consists of 14 consonants and 10 vowels, which can be combined to form syllabic blocks.</p>
<h3>Vowels</h3>
<p>| Letter | Romanization | Sound |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| ㅏ | a | [a] |
| ㅓ | eo | [ʌ] |
| ㅗ | o | [o] |
| ㅜ | u | [u] |
| ㅡ | eu | [ɯ] |
| ㅣ | i | [i] |
| ㅐ | ae | [ɛ] |
| ㅔ | e | [e] |
| ㅚ | oe | [ø] |
| ㅟ | wi | [y] |</p>
<p>There are also compound vowels:</p>
<p>| Letter | Romanization | Sound |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| ㅑ | ya | [ja] |
| ㅕ | yeo | [jʌ] |
| ㅛ | yo | [jo] |
| ㅠ | yu | [ju] |
| ㅒ | yae | [jɛ] |
| ㅖ | ye | [je] |
| ㅘ | wa | [wa] |
| ㅝ | wo | [wʌ] |
| ㅙ | wae | [wɛ] |
| ㅞ | we | [we] |
| ㅢ | ui | [ɰi] |</p>
<h3>Consonants</h3>
<p>| Letter | Romanization | Sound |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| ㄱ | g/k | [k]/[g] |
| ㄴ | n | [n] |
| ㄷ | d/t | [t]/[d] |
| ㄹ | r/l | [ɾ]/[l] |
| ㅁ | m | [m] |
| ㅂ | b/p | [p]/[b] |
| ㅅ | s | [s]/[ɕ] |
| ㅇ | ng | [ŋ] (silent when initial) |
| ㅈ | j | [tɕ] |
| ㅊ | ch | [tɕʰ] |
| ㅋ | k | [kʰ] |
| ㅌ | t | [tʰ] |
| ㅍ | p | [pʰ] |
| ㅎ | h | [h] |</p>
<p>There are also tense consonants, represented by doubling the consonant:</p>
<p>| Letter | Romanization | Sound |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| ㄲ | kk | [k͈] |
| ㄸ | tt | [t͈] |
| ㅃ | pp | [p͈] |
| ㅆ | ss | [s͈] |
| ㅉ | jj | [t͈ɕ] |</p>
<h3>Syllable structure</h3>
<p>Korean syllables are structured as (C)(G)V(C), where C is a consonant, G is a glide (y or w), and V is a vowel. The maximum syllable structure is CGVC.</p>
<p>Examples:
- 나 <strong>na</strong> [na] (I/me)
- 한 <strong>han</strong> [han] (one)
- 꽃 <strong>kkoch</strong> [k͈ot̚] (flower)
- 귤 <strong>gyul</strong> [kjul] (tangerine)</p>
<h3>Sound changes</h3>
<ol>
<li>Final consonant neutralization: At the end of a syllable, the consonants ㄱ, ㄲ, ㅋ are all pronounced [k̚], ㄷ, ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㅌ are all pronounced [t̚], and ㅂ, ㅍ are both pronounced [p̚].</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: 꽃 <strong>kkoch</strong> [k͈ot̚] (flower)</p>
<ol>
<li>Nasalization: When ㄱ [k], ㄷ [t], or ㅂ [p] are followed by ㅁ [m] or ㄴ [n], they become [ŋ], [n], and [m] respectively.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: 학년 <strong>haknyeon</strong> [haŋnjʌn] (school year)</p>
<ol>
<li>Palatalization: When ㄷ [t] or ㅌ [tʰ] are followed by ㅣ [i] or ㅑ [ja], they become ㅈ [tɕ] or ㅊ [tɕʰ] respectively.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: 같이 <strong>gachi</strong> [katɕʰi] (together)</p>
<h3>Stress and intonation</h3>
<p>Korean doesn't have lexical stress like English. Instead, it uses pitch accent, where the pitch of certain syllables is higher than others. The general pattern is a rise in pitch on the second syllable of a word, but this can vary depending on the specific word and context.</p>
<h2>Morphology</h2>
<p>Korean is an agglutinative language, meaning that grammatical functions are expressed by adding suffixes or particles to the stem of a word.</p>
<h3>Nouns</h3>
<p>Korean nouns do not inflect for number or gender. Plurality can be indicated by the suffix 들 <strong>-deul</strong>, but it's often omitted when the context is clear.</p>
<p>Example:
- 책 <strong>chaek</strong> (book)
- 책들 <strong>chaekdeul</strong> (books)</p>
<p>Case is marked by particles added after the noun:</p>
<p>| Particle | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 이/가 <strong>-i/-ga</strong> | Subject marker | 나<strong>가</strong> 간다 <strong>na-ga ganda</strong> (I go) |
| 을/를 <strong>-eul/-reul</strong> | Object marker | 책<strong>을</strong> 읽는다 <strong>chaek-eul ilgneunda</strong> (I read a book) |
| 의 <strong>-ui</strong> | Possessive | 내<strong>의</strong> 책 <strong>nae-ui chaek</strong> (my book) |
| 에 <strong>-e</strong> | Locative | 학교<strong>에</strong> 간다 <strong>hakgyo-e ganda</strong> (I go to school) |
| 에서 <strong>-eseo</strong> | Locative (for actions) | 학교<strong>에서</strong> 공부한다 <strong>hakgyo-eseo gongbuhanda</strong> (I study at school) |
| 로/으로 <strong>-ro/-euro</strong> | Directional | 서울<strong>로</strong> 간다 <strong>seoul-ro ganda</strong> (I go to Seoul) |</p>
<h3>Pronouns</h3>
<p>Personal pronouns in Korean are often omitted when the context is clear. When used, they are:</p>
<p>| Person | Informal | Formal |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st singular | 나 <strong>na</strong> | 저 <strong>jeo</strong> |
| 2nd singular | 너 <strong>neo</strong> | 당신 <strong>dangsin</strong> |
| 3rd singular | 그/그녀 <strong>geu/geunyeo</strong> | 그분 <strong>geubun</strong> |
| 1st plural | 우리 <strong>uri</strong> | 저희 <strong>jeohui</strong> |
| 2nd plural | 너희 <strong>neohui</strong> | 여러분 <strong>yeoreobun</strong> |
| 3rd plural | 그들/그녀들 <strong>geudeul/geunyeodeul</strong> | 그분들 <strong>geubundeul</strong> |</p>
<h3>Numbers</h3>
<p>Korean has two number systems: native Korean and Sino-Korean.</p>
<p>Native Korean numbers (used for counting up to 99, ages, hours, etc.):</p>
<p>| Number | Korean | Romanization |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | 하나 | hana |
| 2 | 둘 | dul |
| 3 | 셋 | set |
| 4 | 넷 | net |
| 5 | 다섯 | daseot |
| 6 | 여섯 | yeoseot |
| 7 | 일곱 | ilgop |
| 8 | 여덟 | yeodeol |
| 9 | 아홉 | ahop |
| 10 | 열 | yeol |</p>
<p>Sino-Korean numbers (used for dates, money, phone numbers, etc.):</p>
<p>| Number | Korean | Romanization |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | 일 | il |
| 2 | 이 | i |
| 3 | 삼 | sam |
| 4 | 사 | sa |
| 5 | 오 | o |
| 6 | 육 | yuk |
| 7 | 칠 | chil |
| 8 | 팔 | pal |
| 9 | 구 | gu |
| 10 | 십 | sip |</p>
<h3>Adjectives</h3>
<p>In Korean, adjectives function similarly to verbs and are sometimes called "descriptive verbs". They can be used as predicates without a copula.</p>
<p>Example:
- 크다 <strong>keuda</strong> (to be big)
- 산이 크다 <strong>san-i keuda</strong> (The mountain is big)</p>
<p>To modify a noun, adjectives use the attributive form:</p>
<ul>
<li>큰 산 <strong>keun san</strong> (big mountain)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Verbs</h3>
<p>Korean verbs are highly regular but complex due to the agglutinative nature of the language. Verbs do not conjugate for person or number, but they do for tense, aspect, mood, formality level, and honoring the subject or object.</p>
<p>The basic structure of a Korean verb is: Stem + Tense/Aspect + Formality/Honorific + Mood</p>
<p>Example with the verb 가다 <strong>gada</strong> (to go):</p>
<p>| Form | Korean | Romanization | Meaning |
|------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Present informal | 가 | ga | (I/you/he/she/it/we/they) go |
| Present formal | 갑니다 | gamnida | (I/you/he/she/it/we/they) go (formal) |
| Past informal | 갔어 | gasseo | (I/you/he/she/it/we/they) went |
| Past formal | 갔습니다 | gasseumnida | (I/you/he/she/it/we/they) went (formal) |
| Future informal | 갈 거야 | gal geoya | (I/you/he/she/it/we/they) will go |
| Future formal | 갈 것입니다 | gal geossimnida | (I/you/he/she/it/we/they) will go (formal) |</p>
<p>Honorific forms are used to show respect to the subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>가십니다 <strong>gasimnida</strong> (The respected person goes)</li>
</ul>
<p>Humble forms are used when the speaker is the subject and addressing someone of higher status:</p>
<ul>
<li>가겠습니다 <strong>gagetsseumnida</strong> (I will go, said humbly)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Particles</h3>
<p>Korean uses a wide variety of particles to indicate grammatical functions and nuances. Some common ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li>는/은 <strong>-neun/-eun</strong>: Topic marker</li>
<li>도 <strong>-do</strong>: Also, too</li>
<li>만 <strong>-man</strong>: Only</li>
<li>부터 <strong>-buteo</strong>: From</li>
<li>까지 <strong>-kkaji</strong>: Until, up to</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:
- 나<strong>는</strong> 학생<strong>이고</strong> 그<strong>도</strong> 학생<strong>이다</strong>
- <strong>Na-neun</strong> haksaeng<strong>-igo</strong> geu<strong>-do</strong> haksaeng<strong>-ida</strong>
- I am a student and he is also a student</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<h3>Basic word order</h3>
<p>The basic word order in Korean is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV):</p>
<ul>
<li>나<strong>는</strong> 책<strong>을</strong> 읽<strong>는다</strong></li>
<li><strong>Na-neun</strong> chaek<strong>-eul</strong> ilg<strong>neunda</strong></li>
<li>I book read (I read a book)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the word order can be quite flexible due to the use of particles, as long as the verb remains at the end:</p>
<ul>
<li>책<strong>을</strong> 나<strong>는</strong> 읽<strong>는다</strong> (Emphasizing "book")</li>
<li><strong>Chaek-eul</strong> na<strong>-neun</strong> ilg<strong>neunda</strong></li>
<li>Book I read</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>Yes/no questions are formed by adding the question particle 까 <strong>-kka</strong> (formal) or 아/어 <strong>-a/-eo</strong> (informal) to the end of a statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>학생입니까? <strong>Haksaengimnigga?</strong> (Are you a student? - formal)</li>
<li>학생이에요? <strong>Haksaengieyo?</strong> (Are you a student? - informal)</li>
</ul>
<p>Wh-questions use question words in the same position as the word they're replacing:</p>
<ul>
<li>누가 왔어요? <strong>Nuga wasseoyo?</strong> (Who came?)</li>
<li>어디에 가요? <strong>Eodie gayo?</strong> (Where are you going?)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Negation</h3>
<p>Korean has two main ways of forming negatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using 안 <strong>an</strong> before the verb:</li>
<li>
<p>안 가요 <strong>An gayo</strong> (I don't go)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using 지 않다 <strong>ji anhda</strong> after the verb stem:</p>
</li>
<li>가지 않아요 <strong>Gaji anhayo</strong> (I don't go)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Relative clauses</h3>
<p>In Korean, relative clauses come before the noun they modify and end with an adjectival form of the verb:</p>
<ul>
<li>어제 <strong>본</strong> 영화 <strong>Eoje bon yeonghwa</strong> (The movie (that I) saw yesterday)</li>
<li>한국에서 <strong>온</strong> 학생 <strong>Hangukseo on haksaeng</strong> (The student who came from Korea)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reported speech</h3>
<p>Reported speech in Korean uses the quotative particles 라고 <strong>-rago</strong> (for direct quotes) or 고 <strong>-go</strong> (for indirect quotes):</p>
<ul>
<li>그는 "나는 학생이다"<strong>라고</strong> 말했다</li>
<li><strong>Geuneun "naneun haksaengida"rago malhaessda</strong></li>
<li>
<p>He said, "I am a student"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>그는 자기가 학생이<strong>라고</strong> 말했다</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Geuneun jagiga haksaengi-rago malhaessda</strong></li>
<li>He said that he was a student</li>
</ul>
<h2>Honorifics and Politeness</h2>
<p>Korean has an extensive system of honorifics and speech levels, reflecting the importance of social hierarchy in Korean culture. There are generally considered to be seven speech levels, but in modern Korean, four are commonly used:</p>
<ol>
<li>해요체 <strong>Haeyo-che</strong> (Polite informal)</li>
<li>
<p>안녕하세요 <strong>Annyeonghaseyo</strong> (Hello)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>합쇼체 <strong>Hapsyo-che</strong> (Polite formal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>안녕하십니까 <strong>Annyeonghashimnikka</strong> (Hello)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>해체 <strong>Hae-che</strong> (Casual)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>안녕 <strong>Annyeong</strong> (Hi)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>해라체 <strong>Haera-che</strong> (Plain)</p>
</li>
<li>가라 <strong>Gara</strong> (Go)</li>
</ol>
<p>The choice of speech level depends on the social relationship between the speaker and the listener, as well as the formality of the situation.</p>
<p>In addition to speech levels, Korean uses honorific words and verb forms to showrespect to the subject or recipient of an action. Here are some key aspects of the honorific system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Subject honorifics: The suffix 시 <strong>-si</strong> is added to verbs to honor the subject.</li>
<li>
<p>할아버지께서 주무<strong>시</strong>다 <strong>Harabeojikkeseo jumu-si-da</strong> (Grandfather sleeps)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Object honorifics: Special verb forms are used when the object of the action is honored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>선생님께 드리다 <strong>Seonsaengnim-kke deurida</strong> (To give to the teacher)
   Instead of: 선생님에게 주다 <strong>Seonsaengnim-ege juda</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honorific nouns: Some nouns have special honorific forms.</p>
</li>
<li>진지 <strong>jinji</strong> (honorific for 밥 <strong>bap</strong>, rice/meal)</li>
<li>
<p>연세 <strong>yeonse</strong> (honorific for 나이 <strong>nai</strong>, age)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honorific particles: The particle 께서 <strong>-kkeseo</strong> is used instead of 이/가 <strong>-i/-ga</strong> for honored subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>선생님<strong>께서</strong> 오셨다 <strong>Seonsaengnim-kkeseo osyeossda</strong> (The teacher came)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humble forms: Speakers use humble forms to lower themselves when speaking to someone of higher status.</p>
</li>
<li>말씀드리다 <strong>malsseumdeurida</strong> (to tell, humble)
   Instead of: 말하다 <strong>malhada</strong> (to tell, neutral)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Vocabulary</h2>
<p>Korean vocabulary consists of native Korean words, Sino-Korean words (words of Chinese origin), and loanwords from other languages.</p>
<ol>

<h2>Dialects</h2>
<p>While Standard Korean (표준어 <strong>pyojun-eo</strong>) is based on the Seoul dialect, there are several distinct regional dialects in Korea:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>경상도 방언 <strong>Gyeongsang-do bang-eon</strong>: Spoken in the southeastern part of South Korea, including Busan. Known for its distinctive intonation patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>전라도 방언 <strong>Jeolla-do bang-eon</strong>: Spoken in the southwestern part of South Korea. Often considered to have a melodic quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>충청도 방언 <strong>Chungcheong-do bang-eon</strong>: Spoken in the central region of South Korea. Known for its slow, drawling speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>제주도 방언 <strong>Jeju-do bang-eon</strong>: Spoken on Jeju Island. So distinct that it's sometimes considered a separate language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>평안도 방언 <strong>Pyeongan-do bang-eon</strong>: Spoken in the northwestern part of North Korea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>함경도 방언 <strong>Hamgyeong-do bang-eon</strong>: Spoken in the northeastern part of North Korea.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These dialects can differ in vocabulary, pronunciation, and even some grammatical structures. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard: 그것 좀 주세요 <strong>Geugeot jom juseyo</strong> (Please give me that)</li>
<li>Gyeongsang: 고거 좀 주소 <strong>Gogeo jom juso</strong></li>
<li>Jeolla: 그것 좀 주쑈 <strong>Geugeot jom jusyo</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Writing System</h2>
<p>The Korean writing system, known as Hangul (한글 <strong>hangeul</strong>), was created in 1443 by King Sejong the Great. It's considered one of the most scientific writing systems in the world due to its systematic design.</p>
<p>Hangul consists of 24 basic letters:</p>
<ul>
<li>14 consonants: ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ</li>
<li>10 vowels: ㅏ ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ ㅣ</li>
</ul>
<p>These letters are combined into syllabic blocks. Each syllable block must have at least one consonant and one vowel. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>한 <strong>han</strong>: ㅎ (h) + ㅏ (a) + ㄴ (n)</li>
<li>글 <strong>geul</strong>: ㄱ (g) + ㅡ (eu) + ㄹ (l)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some interesting features of Hangul:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The shapes of the consonants are based on the shape of the mouth when pronouncing them. For example, ㄱ (g/k) represents the back of the tongue blocking the throat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vowels are composed of three basic shapes: • (dot), ㅡ (horizontal line), and ㅣ (vertical line). These represent heaven, earth, and human respectively in East Asian philosophy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complex vowels are made by combining basic vowels. For example, ㅚ (oe) is a combination of ㅗ (o) and ㅣ (i).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tense consonants are represented by doubling the consonant symbol: ㄲ ㄸ ㅃ ㅆ ㅉ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although Hangul is the primary writing system, Hanja (Chinese characters) are still occasionally used, especially in academic or formal contexts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Sound Symbolism</h2>
<p>Korean has a rich system of sound symbolism, where certain sounds are associated with specific meanings or sensations. This is particularly evident in the language's extensive use of ideophones and onomatopoeia.</p>
<ol>
<li>Vowel alternation: Changing the vowel can alter the nuance of a word.</li>
<li>반짝반짝 <strong>banjjak-banjjak</strong> (glittering, bright flashes)</li>
<li>
<p>번쩍번쩍 <strong>beonjjek-beonjjek</strong> (glittering, more intense flashes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consonant tensing: Tensing a consonant often intensifies the meaning.</p>
</li>
<li>둥글둥글 <strong>dunggeul-dunggeul</strong> (roundish, gentle rolling)</li>
<li>
<p>뚱굴뚱굴 <strong>ttungul-ttungul</strong> (rounder, more vigorous rolling)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consonant alternation: Changing certain consonants can alter the size or intensity of the described action or state.</p>
</li>
<li>가볍다 <strong>gabyeopda</strong> (light)</li>
<li>
<p>카풀다 <strong>kapulda</strong> (very light, fluffy)</p>
</li>
<li>

<h2>Loanword Adaptation</h2>
<p>Korean has borrowed words from various languages throughout its history, with significant influences from Chinese, and more recently, English. The way these loanwords are adapted into Korean phonology and orthography is interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li>Chinese loanwords (Sino-Korean):</li>
<li>학교 <strong>hakgyo</strong> (school, from Chinese 學校 xuéxiào)</li>
<li>
<p>전화 <strong>jeonhwa</strong> (telephone, from Chinese 電話 diànhuà)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>English loanwords:</p>
</li>
<li>버스 <strong>beoseu</strong> (bus)</li>
<li>
<p>컴퓨터 <strong>keompyuteo</strong> (computer)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other languages:</p>
</li>
<li>아르바이트 <strong>areubaiteu</strong> (part-time job, from German Arbeit)</li>
<li>빵 <strong>ppang</strong> (bread, from Portuguese pão)</li>
</ol>
<p>When adapting foreign words, Korean often makes these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adds vowels to break up consonant clusters: "strike" becomes 스트라이크 <strong>seuteuraikeu</strong></li>
<li>Replaces sounds not found in Korean: "f" often becomes "p", so "coffee" becomes 커피 <strong>keopi</strong></li>
<li>Adapts words to fit Korean syllable structure: "cream" becomes 크림 <strong>keurim</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Pragmatics</h2>
<p>Korean pragmatics are heavily influenced by the culture's emphasis on social hierarchy and group harmony. This is reflected in various aspects of the language:</p>
<ol>
<li>Address terms: Koreans rarely use personal names to address others, instead using titles or kinship terms.</li>
<li>선생님 <strong>seonsaengnim</strong> (teacher, also used for professionals)</li>
<li>
<p>언니 <strong>eonni</strong> (older sister, used by females to address older females)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indirect communication: Korean often prefers indirect communication to maintain harmony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of directly saying "no," one might say 좀 어렵겠네요 <strong>jom eoryeopgetneyo</strong> (It might be a bit difficult)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honorifics: As mentioned earlier, the extensive honorific system reflects and reinforces social relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silence: In Korean culture, silence can be a meaningful form of communication, often indicating thoughtfulness or respect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ritual phrases: Korean has many set phrases used in specific situations:</p>
</li>
<li>수고하셨습니다 <strong>sugohasyeosseumnida</strong> (You've worked hard, often used when leaving work)</li>
<li>잘 먹겠습니다 <strong>jal meokgetseumnida</strong> (I will eat well, said before eating)</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding these pragmatic aspects is crucial for effective communication in Korean, often more so than perfect grammar or pronunciation.</p>
