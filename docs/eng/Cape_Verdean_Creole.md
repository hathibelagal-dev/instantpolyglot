# Cape Verdean Creole

Cape Verdean Creole, also known as Kriolu or Crioulo, is a Portuguese-based creole language spoken in Cape Verde, an archipelago off the west coast of Africa. It is the native language of the majority of Cape Verdeans and is used in everyday communication, although Portuguese remains the official language for formal and written contexts.

## Varieties

Cape Verdean Creole has several varieties, corresponding to the different islands of the archipelago. The main varieties are:

1. Sotavento Creoles (Southern islands):
   - Santiago (Badiu)
   - Fogo
   - Brava
   - Maio

2. Barlavento Creoles (Northern islands):
   - São Vicente
   - Santo Antão
   - São Nicolau
   - Sal
   - Boa Vista

While there are differences between these varieties, they are generally mutually intelligible. This overview will focus primarily on the Santiago variety, which is the most widely spoken.

### Stress

Stress in Cape Verdean Creole is generally predictable and falls on the penultimate syllable in most words. However, there are exceptions, particularly in words of Portuguese origin. Some examples:

- **kása** [ˈkasa] (house)
- **meninu** [meˈninu] (boy)
- **kafé** [kaˈfɛ] (coffee)

### Phonological processes

1. Final vowel reduction: Unstressed final vowels are often reduced or dropped in casual speech.
   Example: **kasa** [ˈkasa] → [kas]

2. Nasal assimilation: Vowels before nasal consonants often become nasalized.
   Example: **kanta** [ˈkãnta] (to sing)

3. Consonant clusters: Unlike Portuguese, Cape Verdean Creole tends to break up consonant clusters with epenthetic vowels.
   Example: Portuguese “flor” → Cape Verdean Creole **flor** [fiˈlor] (flower)

## Morphology

Cape Verdean Creole has a simpler morphological structure compared to Portuguese, with less inflection and a greater reliance on isolating features.

### Nouns

Nouns in Cape Verdean Creole generally do not inflect for gender or number. The plural is typically indicated by context or by using numerals or quantifiers.

Examples:
- **kasa** (house/houses)
- **dos kasa** (two houses)
- **txeu kasa** (many houses)

Some nouns of Portuguese origin retain gender distinctions:
- **mininu** (boy) / **minina** (girl)
- **tiu** (uncle) / **tia** (aunt)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | **N** / **mi** | **nu** / **nos** |
| 2nd    | **bu** | **nhos** |
| 3rd    | **el** | **es** |

Examples:
- **N ta bai** (I'm going)

- **nos kasa** (our house)
- **nhos kasa** (your (plural) house)
- **ses kasa** (their house)

### Verbs

Verbs in Cape Verdean Creole do not conjugate for person or number. Tense, aspect, and mood are indicated by separate particles.

1. Present tense / Habitual:
   The particle **ta** is used to indicate present or habitual actions.
   Example: **N ta kume** (I eat / I am eating)

2. Past tense:
   The suffix **-ba** is added to the verb stem.
   Example: **N kumeba** (I ate)

3. Future tense:
   The particle **ta** is combined with the verb **ba** (to go).
   Example: **N ta ba kume** (I will eat)

4. Progressive aspect:
   The particle **sata** or **sta ta** is used.
   Example: **N sata kume** (I am eating)

5. Perfect aspect:
   The particle **dja** is used before the verb.
   Example: **N dja kume** (I have eaten)

6. Conditional:
   The particle **ta** is combined with the verb **ba** and the suffix **-ba**.
   Example: **N ta ba kumeba** (I would eat)

7. Imperative:
   The bare verb form is used for commands.
   Example: **Kume!** (Eat!)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Cape Verdean Creole generally do not agree in gender or number with the nouns they modify. They typically follow the noun.

Examples:
- **kasa grandi** (big house / big houses)
- **mininu bonitu** (handsome boy)
- **minina bonita** (beautiful girl)

Comparison of adjectives:
- Comparative: **mas** + adjective
  Example: **mas grandi** (bigger)
- Superlative: **mas** + adjective + **di tudu**
  Example: **mas grandi di tudu** (biggest)

### Adverbs

Many adverbs are formed by adding the suffix **-menti** to adjectives:
- **rapidu** (quick) → **rapidumenti** (quickly)
- **sabi** (good) → **sabimenti** (well)

Some common adverbs:
- **oji** (today)
- **manha** (tomorrow)
- **onti** (yesterday)
- **sempri** (always)
- **nunka** (never)

## Syntax

Cape Verdean Creole generally follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order.

### Basic sentence structure

1. Declarative sentences:
   **N ta kume pexe** (I eat fish)
   Subject (N) + TMA marker (ta) + Verb (kume) + Object (pexe)

2. Negative sentences:
   The negative particle **ka** is placed before the verb or TMA marker.
   **N ka ta kume pexe** (I don’t eat fish)

3. Interrogative sentences:
   Questions are typically formed by raising intonation at the end of a declarative sentence.
   **Bu ta kume pexe?** (Do you eat fish?)

   Wh-questions use interrogative words at the beginning of the sentence:
   **Kenha ki ta kume pexe?** (Who eats fish?)
   **Kuze ki bu ta kume?** (What do you eat?)

### Copula

Cape Verdean Creole uses different copulas depending on the context:

1. **e** for equative sentences:
   **Maria e profesora** (Maria is a teacher)

2. **sta** for locative and temporary states:
   **Livru sta riba mesa** (The book is on the table)
   **N sta duenti** (I am sick)

3. Zero copula for permanent attributes:
   **Kel kasa grandi** (That house is big)

### Serial verb constructions

Cape Verdean Creole makes use of serial verb constructions, where two or more verbs are used in sequence without conjunctions:

**N bai merkadu kunpra kumida** (I went to the market to buy food)

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by the particle **ki**:

**Omi ki N odja na merkadu e nha tiu** (The man whom I saw at the market is my uncle)

### Adjective placement

Adjectives typically follow the noun they modify:

**kasa grandi** (big house)
**mininu bunitu** (handsome boy)

However, some common adjectives can precede the noun:
**bon dia** (good day)
**mal tenpu** (bad weather)

### Possession

Possession is indicated by juxtaposition, with the possessor following the possessed:

**kasa Maria** (Maria's house)
**livru mininu** (the child's book)

For pronominal possession, possessive pronouns are used:

**nha kasa** (my house)
**se livru** (his/her book)

## Phonological Variation

As mentioned earlier, there are several varieties of Cape Verdean Creole. Here are some examples of phonological variation between the Sotavento (southern) and Barlavento (northern) varieties:

1. Pronunciation of “r”:
   - Sotavento: [ɾ] (alveolar tap)
   - Barlavento: [ʁ] (uvular fricative)
   Example: **karu** (car)
   - Sotavento: [ˈkaɾu]
   - Barlavento: [ˈkaʁu]

2. Final unstressed vowels:
   - Sotavento: often pronounced
   - Barlavento: often dropped or reduced
   Example: **kasa** (house)
   - Sotavento: [ˈkaza]
   - Barlavento: [ˈkaz]

3. Pronunciation of “lh”:
   - Sotavento: [ʎ] (palatal lateral approximant)
   - Barlavento: [j] (palatal approximant)
   Example: **fidju** (son)
   - Sotavento: [ˈfiʎu]
   - Barlavento: [ˈfiju]

4. Vowel nasalization:
   - Sotavento: more prominent
   - Barlavento: less prominent
   Example: **mãi** (mother)
   - Sotavento: [mãj]
   - Barlavento: [maj]

## Grammatical Variation

There are also some grammatical differences between the varieties:

1. First-person singular pronoun:

3. Negation:
   - Sotavento: **ka** (preverbal)
   - Barlavento: **ka** ... **nau** (preverbal and sentence-final)
   Example: “I don’t eat”
   - Sotavento: **N ka ta kume**
   - Barlavento: **Mi ka ta kume nau**

## Code-switching and Borrowing

Due to the official status of Portuguese and increasing global connections, code-switching between Cape Verdean Creole and Portuguese is common, especially among educated speakers. English words are also frequently borrowed, particularly in technology and popular culture domains.

Examples of code-switching:
1. **N ta bai pa beach oji** (I'm going to the beach today)
   - “beach” is used instead of the Creole “praia”

2. **Bu pode give me un call más tardi?** (Can you give me a call later?)
   - “give me un call” is used instead of the Creole “da-m un tokada”

Examples of borrowing:
1. **N mesti upload kel file** (I need to upload that file)
   - “upload” and “file” are English borrowings

2. **El ten un smartphone novu** (He/She has a new smartphone)
   - “smartphone” is an English borrowing

## Proverbs and Sayings

Proverbs play an important role in Cape Verdean culture and language. Here are some examples:

1. **Kusa ki bu ka kre, bu ka ta pô riba bu kama**
   Literally: “What you don’t want, you don’t put on your bed”
   Meaning: Don’t invite trouble into your life

2. **Kada kabesa, kada sentidu**
   Literally: “Each head, each sense”
   Meaning: Everyone has their own opinion

3. **Gotu ta enxe ku pinga**
   Literally: “The glass fills with drops”
   Meaning: Little by little, you can achieve great things

4. **Ken ki ta mara burro e ki ta dismara-l**
   Literally: “Who ties the donkey is who unties it”
   Meaning: The person who creates a problem should solve it

5. **Agu ta kori pa mar**
   Literally: “Water runs to the sea”
   Meaning: Things naturally follow their course

## Writing System

While Cape Verdean Creole is primarily a spoken language, there have been efforts to standardize its writing system. The most widely accepted orthography was proposed by the ALUPEC (Alfabeto Unificado para a Escrita do Cabo-Verdiano) in 1998. This system aims to represent the sounds of all varieties of Cape Verdean Creole.

Some key features of the ALUPEC system:

1. Use of **k** instead of **c** for the [k] sound: **kasa** (house) instead of “casa”

2. Use of **s** instead of **c** before **e** and **i**: **sima** (like) instead of “cima”

3. Use of **x** for the [ʃ] sound: **xavi** (key) instead of “chave”

4. Use of **dj** for the [dʒ] sound: **odja** (to see) instead of “odjâ”

5. Use of **tx** for the [tʃ] sound: **txon** (ground) instead of “chon”

6. Representation of nasalized vowels with **n**: **mon** (hand) instead of “mão”

However, it's worth noting that the use of this standardized orthography is not universal, and variations in spelling are common, especially in informal contexts.

## Influence on Portuguese

Cape Verdean Creole has also influenced the Portuguese spoken in Cape Verde, leading to a distinct variety known as Cape Verdean Portuguese. Some features of this variety include:

1. Vocabulary borrowings from Creole:
   **morabeza** (hospitality), **catchupa** (traditional dish)

2. Pronunciation influences:
   - Reduction of unstressed vowels
   - Tendency to nasalize vowels

3. Grammatical influences:
   - Use of **ter** (to have) instead of **haver** in existential constructions
   - Preference for analytic verb forms over synthetic ones

This mutual influence between Cape Verdean Creole and Portuguese reflects the complex linguistic landscape of Cape Verde and the dynamic nature of language contact situations.
