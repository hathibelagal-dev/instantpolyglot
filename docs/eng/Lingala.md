# Lingala

Lingala (Lingála) is a Bantu language spoken primarily in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Republic of Congo. It's also used to a lesser extent in Angola and the Central African Republic. Lingala serves as a lingua franca in much of the Congo Basin, with an estimated 15-20 million speakers.

## Phonology

### Vowels

Lingala has 7 vowel phonemes:

| IPA | Orthography |
|-----|-------------|
| /i/ | i |
| /e/ | e |
| /ɛ/ | ɛ |
| /a/ | a |
| /ɔ/ | ɔ |
| /o/ | o |
| /u/ | u |

In standard orthography, /ɛ/ is written as “e” and /ɔ/ as “o”. Open-mid vowels are only distinguished in some writing systems or linguistic descriptions.

Vowel length is phonemic. Long vowels are typically written by doubling the vowel letter:

**moto** [mòtó] “person”
**mooto** [mòːtó] “fire”

### Consonants

| IPA | Orthography | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| /p/ | p | **pɛ́pɛ́** “wind” |
| /b/ | b | **bána** “children” |
| /t/ | t | **tála** “look” |
| /d/ | d | **dɔ́ngɔ́** “learn” |
| /k/ | k | **kópa** “glass” |
| /g/ | g | **gáta** “village” |
| /m/ | m | **mama** “mother” |
| /n/ | n | **nzótó** “body” |
| /ɲ/ | ny | **nyama** “meat” |
| /ŋ/ | ng | **ngai** “I, me” |
| /f/ | f | **fúlu** “foam” |
| /v/ | v | **vímba** “swell” |

| /l/ | l | **liloba** “word” |
| /j/ | y | **yébi** “know” |
| /w/ | w | **wápi** “where” |

### Tone

Lingala is a tonal language with two level tones: high (´) and low (`). Tone is phonemic and can distinguish both lexical and grammatical meaning. In standard orthography, tone is usually not marked. When marked for linguistic or pedagogical purposes, only the high tone is typically indicated.

Examples of tonal minimal pairs:

**likambo** [lìkámbò] “problem”
**likámbo** [lìkámbó] “affair”

**kokoma** [kòkómà] “to write”
**kokóma** [kòkómá] “to arrive”

### Syllable structure

The most common syllable structure in Lingala is CV (consonant + vowel). Other possible structures include V, CGV (consonant + glide + vowel), and N (syllabic nasal).

Examples:
**mo-to** CV-CV “person”
**e-bale** V-CV-CV “river”
**mwa-na** CGV-CV “child”
**m-boka** N-CV-CV “village”

## Morphology

Lingala, like other Bantu languages, is highly agglutinative and makes extensive use of prefixes and suffixes.

### Noun classes

Lingala has a system of noun classes, typical of Bantu languages. Each noun belongs to a class, which determines its agreement patterns with other words in the sentence. Lingala has retained 7 main noun classes from Proto-Bantu, plus several minor classes.

| Class | Singular prefix | Plural prefix | Typical meaning |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1/2 | mo- | ba- | humans |
| 3/4 | mo- | mi- | plants, some body parts |
| 5/6 | li- | ma- | various |
| 7/8 | e- | bi- | various |
| 9/10 | N- | N- | animals, loanwords |
| 11 | lo- | - | long objects, abstracts |
| 14 | bo- | - | abstracts |

Examples:

Class 1/2 (humans):
**moto** / **bato** “person” / “people”
**mosali** / **basali** “worker” / “workers”

Class 3/4 (plants, body parts):
**molimo** / **milimo** “spirit” / “spirits”

**loboko** “arm”
**losako** “joy”

Class 14 (abstracts):
**bomoi** “life”
**bolingo** “love”

### Verbs

Lingala verbs consist of a root, which can be modified by various prefixes and suffixes to indicate tense, aspect, mood, and agreement with the subject.

Basic verb structure:
(Subject marker) - (Tense/Aspect marker) - Root - (Extensions) - Final vowel

Example: **na-zal-í ko-lob-a** “I am speaking”
- **na-**: 1st person singular subject marker
- **zal-**: auxiliary verb “to be”
- **-í**: present tense marker
- **ko-**: infinitive prefix
- **lob-**: verb root “speak”
- **-a**: final vowel

#### Tense and Aspect

Lingala distinguishes several tenses and aspects:

1. Present:
**Na-lob-í** “I speak” / “I am speaking”

2. Past:
**Na-lob-ák-í** “I spoke”

3. Future:
**Na-ko-lob-a** “I will speak”

4. Perfect:
**Na-sil-í ko-lob-a** “I have spoken”

5. Progressive:
**Na-zal-í ko-lob-a** “I am speaking”

6. Habitual:
**Na-lob-aka** “I usually speak”

#### Verb extensions

Verb extensions modify the meaning of the verb root:

1. Applicative (-el-):
**ko-sal-a** “to work” → **ko-sal-el-a** “to work for”

2. Causative (-is-):
**ko-kel-a** “to do” → **ko-kel-is-a** “to make do”

3. Passive (-am-):
**ko-bet-a** “to hit” → **ko-bet-am-a** “to be hit”

4. Reciprocal (-an-):
**ko-ling-a** “to love” → **ko-ling-an-a** “to love each other”

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **ngai** | **biso** |
| 2nd | **yo** | **bino** |
| 3rd | **ye** | **bango** |

Possessive pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **-ngai** | **-biso** |
| 2nd | **-yo** | **-bino** |
| 3rd | **-ye** | **-bango** |

These are used with class prefixes, e.g.:
**moto na ngai** “my person”
**bato na biso** “our people”

Demonstrative pronouns:

Lingala has three series of demonstratives:

1. Near speaker: **oyo** (class 1), **eye** (class 7), etc.
2. Near listener: **wana** (class 1), **ena** (class 7), etc.
3. Far from both: **kuna** (class 1), **kena** (class 7), etc.

Example:
**moto oyo** “this person”
**elamba eye** “this cloth”
**moto wana** “that person (near you)”
**elamba kena** “that cloth (over there)”

### Adjectives

True adjectives are relatively rare in Lingala. Many concepts expressed by adjectives in European languages are expressed by verbs or nouns in Lingala.

Some true adjectives:
**-nene** “big”
**-ke** “small”
**-bé** “bad”
**-lái** “long”

These agree with the noun class:
**moto monene** “big person”
**elamba enene** “big cloth”

Many “adjectives” are actually verbs:
**kitoko** “beautiful” (from verb **ko-tok-a** “to be beautiful”)
**moto ya kitoko** “beautiful person”

Or nouns in a genitive construction:
**moto ya mayele** “intelligent person” (lit. “person of intelligence”)

### Numerals

Cardinal numbers:

1-10: **mɔ́kɔ́, mibale, misato, minei, mitáno, motóba, nsambo, mwambe, libwa, zómi**

11-19: **zómi na mɔ́kɔ́, zómi na mibale**, etc.

20, 30, etc.: **tuku mibale, tuku misato**, etc.

100: **monkama**

1000: **nkóto**

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding **ya** before the cardinal number:
**ya mɔ́kɔ́** “first”
**ya mibale** “second”

## Writing system

Lingala is written using the Latin alphabet. The standard orthography was established in the 1970s, but there are variations in use.

Standard alphabet:
a b c d e ɛ f g h i k l m n o ɔ p r s t u v w y z

Additional letters used in some systems:
j q x

Digraphs:
mb, nd, ng, nz, ny

In many texts, especially informal ones, the open-mid vowels ɛ and ɔ are not distinguished from e and o.

Tone is typically not marked in everyday writing, but when needed for linguistic or pedagogical purposes, acute accent (´) is used for high tone:

**mbwa** [mbwà] “dog”
**mbwá** [mbwá] “you (plural)”

## Sample text

Here's a sample text in Lingala with interlinear gloss and translation:

**Bato nyonso ba-butami na bonsomi mpe na lokumu ndenge moko. Ba-zali na mayele mpe
people all 3PL-born.PASS with freedom and with dignity manner one 3PL-be with intelligence and

makanisi, mpe ba-sengeli ko-sala bango na bango na molimo ya bo-kutu.**
thoughts and 3PL-should INF-act 3PL with 3PL with spirit of brotherhood

“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”

(This is Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Lingala)

## Challenges in Lingala linguistics

1. Standardization:
There are ongoing debates about the standardization of Lingala, particularly regarding the inclusion of French loanwords and the preservation of “pure” Lingala forms.

2. Tone marking:
While tone is phonemic in Lingala, it's rarely marked in everyday writing, which can lead to ambiguities.
