# Gothic

Gothic is an extinct East Germanic language that was spoken by the Goths. It is the earliest extensively recorded Germanic language, primarily known from the Codex Argenteus, a 6th-century copy of a 4th-century Bible translation by Bishop Wulfila (or Ulfilas). Gothic is particularly valuable for linguistic studies as it provides insight into early Germanic language features and preserves many archaic elements lost in later Germanic languages.

## Historical Context

The Goths were an East Germanic people who played a significant role in the fall of the Western Roman Empire. They originated in Scandinavia and migrated southward, eventually splitting into two main groups: the Visigoths (West Goths) and the Ostrogoths (East Goths).

The Gothic language was spoken from the 3rd to the 6th centuries AD, primarily in areas of Eastern Europe and later in Italy and Spain. The language became extinct around the 8th or 9th century, replaced by local Romance languages in Western Europe and Slavic languages in Eastern Europe.

## Alphabet and Orthography

The Gothic alphabet was created by Wulfila in the 4th century AD specifically for the purpose of translating the Bible into Gothic. It is based primarily on the Greek alphabet, with some characters derived from Latin and Runic scripts. The alphabet consists of 27 letters.

Here's the Gothic alphabet with its corresponding Latin transliteration and approximate pronunciation:

| Gothic | Latin | IPA | Name |
|--------|-------|-----|------|
| 𐌰 | a | /a/ | aza |
| 𐌱 | b | /b/ | bairkan |
| 𐌲 | g | /ɡ/ | giba |
| 𐌳 | d | /d/ | dags |
| 𐌴 | e | /eː/ | aihvus |
| 𐌵 | q | /kʷ/ | qairþra |
| 𐌶 | z | /z/ | ezec |
| 𐌷 | h | /h/ | hagl |
| 𐌸 | þ | /θ/ | þiuþ |
| 𐌹 | i | /i/ | eis |
| 𐌺 | k | /k/ | kusma |
| 𐌻 | l | /l/ | lagus |
| 𐌼 | m | /m/ | manna |
| 𐌽 | n | /n/ | nauþs |
| 𐌾 | j | /j/ | jer |
| 𐌿 | u | /u/ | uraz |
| 𐍀 | p | /p/ | pairthra |
| 𐍁 | ƕ | /hʷ/ | hvair |
| 𐍂 | r | /r/ | raida |
| 𐍃 | s | /s/ | sauil |
| 𐍄 | t | /t/ | tyz |
| 𐍅 | w | /w/ | winja |
| 𐍆 | f | /f/ | faihu |
| 𐍇 | x | /x/ | xair |
| 𐍈 | ƕ | /hʷ/ | hvair |
| 𐍉 | o | /oː/ | utal |
| 𐌸 | þ | /θ/ | þiuþ |

Note: The characters 𐍁 and 𐍈 represent the same sound and are often used interchangeably in manuscripts.

In Gothic texts, the letters 𐌹 (i) and 𐌿 (u) are sometimes written above the line as diacritics to indicate diphthongs or long vowels. For example, 𐌰𐌹 (ai) and 𐌰𐌿 (au).

## Phonology

### Vowels

Gothic has a relatively simple vowel system compared to later Germanic languages:

| Short | Long |
|-------|------|
| a /a/ | ā /aː/ |
| i /i/ | ē /eː/ |
| u /u/ | ō /oː/ |
| (ai /ɛ/) | ī /iː/ |
| (au /ɔ/) | ū /uː/ |

The vowels in parentheses (ai and au) are sometimes considered diphthongs and sometimes short vowels, depending on the linguistic analysis. When they represent short vowels, they are often transliterated as ⟨aí⟩ and ⟨aú⟩ to distinguish them from the diphthongs.

Examples:
- Short **a**: **atta** (“father”)
- Long **ā**: **jēr** (“year”)
- Short **i**: **fisks** (“fish”)
- Long **ī**: **wīns** (“wine”)
- Short **u**: **sunus** (“son”)
- Long **ū**: **hūs** (“house”)
- **ai** as /ɛ/: **aíþþau** (“or”)
- **ai** as /ai/: **ains** (“one”)
- **au** as /ɔ/: **aúhsa** (“ox”)
- **au** as /au/: **auso** (“ear”)

### Consonants

The Gothic consonant system is as follows:

| Manner | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Labiovelar |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|---------|-------|------------|
| Stops | p b | t d | | | k g | q |
| Fricatives | f | þ | s z | | h | ƕ |
| Nasals | m | | n | | | |
| Liquids | | | l r | | | |
| Approximants | w | | | j | | |

Notable features:
1. The presence of the labiovelar consonants **q** /kʷ/ and **ƕ** /hʷ/, which were lost in most other Germanic languages.
2. The retention of the Proto-Germanic /z/, which became /r/ in many other Germanic languages (a process known as rhotacism).
3. The preservation of the Proto-Germanic /θ/ (written as þ), which was lost or changed in many later Germanic languages.

Examples:
- Labial stop: **bairan** (“to bear”)
- Dental stop: **taihun** (“ten”)
- Velar stop: **gasts** (“guest”)
- Labiovelar stop: **qens** (“woman”)
- Dental fricative: **þiuda** (“people”)
- Labiovelar fricative: **ƕeila** (“time”)
- Nasal: **nama** (“name”)
- Liquid: **liuhaþ** (“light”)
- Approximant: **waurd** (“word”)

## Morphology

Gothic is a highly inflected language, retaining many archaic features of Proto-Indo-European that have been lost in other Germanic languages.

### Nouns

Gothic nouns are declined for case, number, and gender. There are four cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative), two numbers (singular and plural), and three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter).

Nouns are divided into different declension classes based on their stem vowels:

1. a-stems (masculine and neuter)
2. ō-stems (feminine)
3. i-stems (masculine and feminine)
4. u-stems (masculine and feminine)
5. consonant stems (various genders)

Example declension of **dags** (“day”, masculine a-stem):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **dags** | **dagos** |
| Accusative | **dag** | **dagans** |
| Genitive | **dagis** | **dage** |
| Dative | **daga** | **dagam** |

Example declension of **giba** (“gift”, feminine ō-stem):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **giba** | **gibos** |
| Accusative | **giba** | **gibos** |
| Genitive | **gibos** | **gibo** |
| Dative | **gibai** | **gibom** |

Example declension of **gasts** (“guest”, masculine i-stem):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **gasts** | **gasteis** |
| Accusative | **gast** | **gastins** |
| Genitive | **gastis** | **gaste** |
| Dative | **gasta** | **gastim** |

Example declension of **handus** (“hand”, feminine u-stem):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **handus** | **handjus** |
| Accusative | **handu** | **handuns** |
| Genitive | **handaus** | **handiwe** |
| Dative | **handau** | **handum** |

Example declension of **baurgs** (“city”, feminine consonant stem):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **baurgs** | **baurgs** |
| Accusative | **baurg** | **baurgs** |
| Genitive | **baurgs** | **baurge** |
| Dative | **baurg** | **baurgim** |

### Adjectives

Gothic adjectives have two declensions: strong and weak. The strong declension is used when the adjective is not preceded by a determiner, while the weak declension is used when it is.

Example of strong declension for **gods** (“good”):

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nom. Sg. | **goþs** | **goda** | **goþ** |
| Acc. Sg. | **godana** | **goda** | **goþ** |
| Gen. Sg. | **godis** | **godaizos** | **godis** |
| Dat. Sg. | **godamma** | **godai** | **godamma** |
| Nom. Pl. | **godai** | **godos** | **goda** |
| Acc. Pl. | **godans** | **godos** | **goda** |
| Gen. Pl. | **godaize** | **godaizo** | **godaize** |
| Dat. Pl. | **godaim** | **godaim** | **godaim** |

Example of weak declension for **goda** (“good”):

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nom. Sg. | **goda** | **godo** | **godo** |
| Acc. Sg. | **godan** | **godon** | **godo** |
| Gen. Sg. | **godins** | **godons** | **godins** |
| Dat. Sg. | **godin** | **godon** | **godin** |
| Nom. Pl. | **godans** | **godons** | **godona** |
| Acc. Pl. | **godans** | **godons** | **godona** |
| Gen. Pl. | **godane** | **godono** | **godane** |
| Dat. Pl. | **godam** | **godam** | **godam** |

Comparative and superlative forms of adjectives are also attested in Gothic:

- Comparative: formed by adding **-iza** (masculine), **-izei** (feminine), or **-izo** (neuter)
  Example: **batiza** (“better”)

- Superlative: formed by adding **-ists** (masculine), **-ista** (feminine), or **-ist** (neuter)
  Example: **batists** (“best”)

### Pronouns

Gothic has personal, demonstrative, relative, and interrogative pronouns. Here are the personal pronouns:

| Person | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive | Dative |
|--------|------------|------------|----------|--------|
| 1sg | **ik** | **mik** | **meina** | **mis** |
| 2sg | **þu** | **þuk** | **þeina** | **þus** |
| 3sg m | **is** | **ina** | **is** | **imma** |
| 3sg f | **si** | **ija** | **izos** | **izai** |
| 3sg n | **ita** | **ita** | **is** | **imma** |
| 1pl | **weis** | **uns** | **unsara** | **uns** |
| 2pl | **jus** | **izwis** | **izwara** | **izwis** |
| 3pl | **eis** | **ins** | **ize** | **im** |

Demonstrative pronouns:

- **saei** (masculine), **soei** (feminine), **þatei** (neuter): “who, which, that”

Interrogative pronouns:
- **ƕas** (“who?”)
- **ƕa** (“what?”)

### Verbs

Gothic verbs are conjugated for person, number, tense (present and past), mood (indicative, subjunctive, imperative), and voice (active and mediopassive). There are two main classes of verbs: strong verbs (which use ablaut) and weak verbs (which use dental suffixes).

Strong verbs are divided into seven classes based on their ablaut patterns:

1. **ei** - **ai** - **i** - **i**: **steigan** (“to climb”)
2. **iu** - **au** - **u** - **u**: **biudan** (“to offer”)
3. **i** - **a** - **u** - **u**: **bindan** (“to bind”)
4. **i** - **a** - **e** - **u**: **niman** (“to take”)
5. **i** - **a** - **e** - **i**: **giban** (“to give”)
6. **a** - **o** - **o** - **a**: **faran** (“to travel”)
7. **ai** - **ai** - **ai** - **ai**: **haitan** (“to call”)

Weak verbs are divided into four classes:

1. **-jan** verbs: **nasjan** (“to save”)
2. **-on** verbs: **salbon** (“to anoint”)
3. **-an** verbs: **haban** (“to have”)
4. **-nan** verbs (inchoative): **fullnan** (“to become full”)

Example conjugation of the strong verb **niman** (“to take”):

Present Indicative:
| Person | Singular | Plural |

Gothic also has a unique feature among Germanic languages: the mediopassive voice. This voice is used for reflexive, reciprocal, and passive meanings. It's only attested in the present tense:

Example: **haitada** (“he is called”, lit. “he calls himself”)

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **haitada** | **haitanda** |
| 2nd | **haitaza** | **haitanda** |
| 3rd | **haitada** | **haitanda** |

### Numerals

Gothic preserves a full set of numerals, including a dual form for “two”:

1. **ains** (m.), **aina** (f.), **ain** (n.)
2. **twai** (m.), **twos** (f.), **twa** (n.)
3. **þreis** (m.), **þrijos** (f.), **þrija** (n.)
4. **fidwor**
5. **fimf**
6. **saihs**
7. **sibun**
8. **ahtau**
9. **niun**
10. **taihun**
11. **ainlif**
12. **twalif**
20. **twai tigjus**
30. **þreis tigjus**
100. **hund**
1000. **þusundi**

## Syntax

Gothic generally follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, although it can be flexible due to its case system. Here are some key syntactic features:

1. Verb position: In main clauses, the finite verb usually appears in second position (V2), while in subordinate clauses, it tends to come at the end.

Example:
**Ik in garda was.** (“I was in the house.”)
**...þatei ik in garda was.** (“...that I was in the house.”)

2. Negation: The negative particle **ni** precedes the verb:
**Ni mag qiman at mis.** (“He cannot come to me.”)

3. Questions: Yes-no questions are formed by inverting the subject and verb:
**Maguts driggkan stikl þanei ik driggka?** (“Can you drink the cup that I drink?”)

4. Relative clauses: Gothic uses the relative pronoun **saei** (masculine), **soei** (feminine), or **þatei** (neuter):
**Sa manna saei qam.** (“The man who came.”)

5. Passive voice: Formed using the mediopassive endings or the past participle with forms of **wisan** (“to be”):
**Haitada namo is Iesus.** (“His name is called Jesus.”)

6. Conditional sentences: Gothic uses the subjunctive mood in both the protasis and apodosis of conditional sentences:
**Jabai ƕas þuk stautai bi taihswon þeina kinnu, wandei imma jah þo anþara.** (“If someone strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.”)

7. Infinitive constructions: Gothic uses the accusative with infinitive construction, similar to Latin:
**Hausideduþ ina siukan.** (“You heard that he was sick.”, lit. “You heard him to be sick.”)

8. Participle usage: Gothic makes extensive use of participles, often in absolute constructions:
**Jah usleiþandin Iesua in skipa, galesun sik manageins filu du imma.** (“And when Jesus had gone out in the boat, a great multitude gathered to him.”)

## Vocabulary

## Historical Phonology

Gothic preserves many archaic features of Proto-Germanic and even Proto-Indo-European. Some notable sound changes include:

1. Grimm's Law: This set of sound changes affected all Germanic languages, including Gothic:
   - PIE *p, *t, *k > Gothic f, þ, h
   - PIE *b, *d, *g > Gothic p, t, k
   - PIE *bh, *dh, *gh > Gothic b, d, g

Example: PIE *pēd- (“foot”) > Gothic fotus

2. Verner's Law: This explains certain exceptions to Grimm's Law based on the original Indo-European accent:
PIE *ph₂tḗr (“father”) > Gothic fadar (not **faþar)

3. Gothic retained the Proto-Germanic /e/, which became /a/ in North and West Germanic languages:
Gothic **itan** vs Old English **etan** (“to eat”)

4. Gothic preserved Proto-Germanic /z/, which became /r/ in other Germanic languages (rhotacism):
Gothic **huzd** vs Old English **hord** (“treasure”)

5. Proto-Germanic /eu/ became /iu/ in Gothic:
Gothic **diups** vs Old English **deop** (“deep”)

6. Gothic preserved the Proto-Germanic /j/ and /w/ in all positions:
Gothic **juk** (“yoke”) vs Old English **geoc**
Gothic **waurms** (“worm”) vs Old English **wyrm**

7. Gothic maintained the distinction between Proto-Germanic long and short vowels:
Gothic **fōtus** (“foot”) vs **sunus** (“son”)

8. The Proto-Germanic diphthongs *ai and *au were preserved in Gothic, while they were monophthongized in many other Germanic languages:
Gothic **stains** vs Old English **stān** (“stone”)
Gothic **auso** vs Old English **ēare** (“ear”)

## Dialectal Variations

While our knowledge of Gothic is primarily based on the Bible translation, which represents a standardized form of the language, there is some evidence of dialectal variations:

1. Crimean Gothic: A dialect spoken by the Crimean Goths until the late 18th century. It's known from a wordlist compiled in the 16th century and shows some divergences from Biblical Gothic.

2. The “Skeireins”: A Gothic commentary on the Gospel of John that shows some linguistic differences from Wulfila's Bible translation, possibly representing a different dialect or a later stage of the language.

## Gothic Influence on Other Languages

While Gothic itself became extinct, it left traces in other languages:

1. Spanish: Some Gothic loanwords entered Spanish during the Visigothic rule of the Iberian Peninsula. Examples include **rico** (“rich”) from Gothic **reiks**, and **guardar** (“to guard”) from Gothic **wardjan**.

2. Italian: Some Gothic words entered Italian, such as **arredo** (“furniture”) from Gothic **rēds** (“counsel, advice”).

3. Balkan languages: The Gothic presence in the Balkans left some traces in local languages. For example, Romanian **nasture** (“button”) is thought to come from Gothic **nati-saurs** (“net-thread”).

## Sample Texts

Here are a few sample texts in Gothic to illustrate the language's features:

1. The beginning of the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:9-10):

**Atta unsar þu in himinam,
weihnai namo þein.
qimai þiudinassus þeins.
wairþai wilja þeins,
swe in himina jah ana airþai.**

“Our Father, you in heaven,
hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come.
Your will be done,
as in heaven also on earth.”

2. A verse from John 3:16:

**Swa auk frijoda guþ þo manaseþ ei sunu seinana þana ainaha atgaf, ei ƕazuh saei galaubjai du imma ni fraqistnai, ak agai libain aiweinon.**

“For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.”

3. A passage from Luke 2:1-3:

**Warþ þan in dagans jainans, urrann gagrefts fram kaisara Agustau, gameljan allana midjungard. soh þan gilstrameleins frumista warþ at wisandin kindina Swriais raginondin Saurim Kwreinaiau. jah iddjedun allai ei melidai weseina, ƕarjizuh in seinai baurg.**

“In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered.”

These texts demonstrate various features of Gothic grammar, including case inflections, verb conjugations, and syntax.
