# Kurdish

Kurdish (Kurdish: **کوردی**, **Kurdî**) is an Indo-European language belonging to the Iranian branch. It is spoken by approximately 30-40 million people, primarily in the Kurdish regions of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, collectively known as Kurdistan. Kurdish is not a single unified language but rather a group of related dialects, with the main varieties being Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish), Sorani (Central Kurdish), and Southern Kurdish.

## Dialects

The main Kurdish dialects are:

1. Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish): Spoken in Turkey, Syria, northern Iraq, and northwestern Iran.
2. Sorani (Central Kurdish): Spoken in Iraq and Iran.
3. Southern Kurdish: Includes Kermanshahi and Laki, spoken in western Iran.
4. Gorani: Sometimes considered a separate language, spoken in parts of Iran and Iraq.

This overview will focus primarily on Kurmanji and Sorani, as they are the most widely spoken varieties.

## Writing Systems

Kurdish uses different writing systems depending on the region and dialect:

1. Latin alphabet: Used for Kurmanji in Turkey and Syria.
2. Arabic-based alphabet: Used for Sorani in Iraq and Iran, and sometimes for Kurmanji in Iran.
3. Cyrillic alphabet: Formerly used in the Soviet Union, now rarely used.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Kurmanji consonant inventory:

| | Labial | Dental/Alveolar | Postalveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plosive | p b | t d | | | k ɡ | q |
| Affricate | | | tʃ dʒ | | | |

Sorani has a similar consonant inventory with some differences:

- The uvular stop [q] is more common in Sorani.
- Sorani has a velarized lateral [ɫ] (ڵ) in addition to the plain [l] (ل).
- The distinction between [v] and [w] is less clear in Sorani.

### Vowels

## Stress

In Kurdish, stress is generally predictable:

1. In Kurmanji, stress usually falls on the last syllable of the word: **kitêb** [kɪˈteb] (book), **Kurdistan** [kʊɾdɪsˈtɑn] (Kurdistan).

2. In Sorani, stress typically falls on the final syllable of the stem, before any suffixes: **kitêb** [kɪˈteb] (book), **kitêbek**e [kɪˈtebækæ] (the book).

3. Some prefixes and suffixes can affect stress placement in both dialects.

## Morphology

Kurdish is an inflectional language with a rich morphological system.

### Nouns

Nouns in Kurdish have the following grammatical features:

1. Gender (in Kurmanji): masculine and feminine
2. Number: singular and plural
3. Case (in Kurmanji): direct and oblique
4. Definiteness

#### Gender (Kurmanji)

In Kurmanji, nouns are either masculine or feminine. There are no strict rules for determining gender, but some general patterns exist:

- Most nouns ending in -î are feminine: **azadî** (freedom), **kurdî** (Kurdish language)
- Most nouns denoting male beings are masculine: **bira** (brother), **mêr** (man)
- Most nouns denoting female beings are feminine: **xwişk** (sister), **jin** (woman)

#### Number

Plural formation varies between dialects and can be irregular. Some common patterns:

Kurmanji:
- Add -an: **gund** (village) → **gund**an (villages)
- Add -in: **çav** (eye) → **çav**in (eyes)

Sorani:
- Add -an: **kitêb** (book) → **kitêb**an (books)
- Add -ekan: **şar** (city) → **şar**ekan (cities)

#### Case (Kurmanji)

Kurmanji has two cases: direct and oblique. The oblique case is used for objects of transitive verbs, possessors, and objects of prepositions.

Examples:
- Direct: **Ez kitêb**ê dibînim. (I see the book.)
- Oblique: Ez **kitêb**ê dixwînim. (I read the book.)

#### Definiteness

In both dialects, definiteness is marked by suffixes:

Kurmanji:
- Indefinite singular: -ek
- Definite singular: -e (masculine), -a (feminine)

Examples:
- **kitêb**ek (a book)
- **kitêb**e (the book, masculine)
- **name**yek (a letter)
- **name**ya (the letter, feminine)

Sorani:
- Indefinite singular: -êk
- Definite singular: -eke

Examples:
- **kitêb**êk (a book)
- **kitêb**eke (the book)

### Pronouns

#### Personal Pronouns

Kurmanji:

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|---|---|
| 1st person | ez | em |
| 2nd person | tu | hûn |
| 3rd person (m) | ew | ew |
| 3rd person (f) | ew | ew |

Sorani:

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|---|---|
| 1st person | min | ême |
| 2nd person | to | êwe |
| 3rd person | ew | ewan |

#### Demonstrative Pronouns

Kurmanji:
- Near: **ev** (this), **evan** (these)
- Far: **ew** (that), **wan** (those)

Sorani:
- Near: **em** (this), **emane** (these)
- Far: **ew** (that), **ewane** (those)

### Adjectives

In Kurdish, adjectives usually follow the noun they modify and agree in gender and number (in Kurmanji).

Kurmanji examples:
- **kitêba mezin** (the big book, feminine)
- **kitêbên mezin** (big books)

Sorani examples:
- **kitêbî gewre** (the big book)
- **kitêbe gewrekan** (the big books)

Comparative and superlative forms:

Kurmanji:
- Comparative: add -tir
- Superlative: add -tirîn

Example: **baş** (good) → **baş**tir (better) → **baş**tirîn (best)

Sorani:
- Comparative: add -tir
- Superlative: add -tirîn

Example: **baş** (good) → **baş**tir (better) → **baş**tirîn (best)

### Verbs

Kurdish verbs are highly inflected, showing agreement with the subject in person and number. They also have different stems for present and past tenses.

#### Verb Stems

Most Kurdish verbs have two stems:

1. Present stem: used for present tense, subjunctive, and imperative
2. Past stem: used for past tense and perfect aspects

Example (Kurmanji):
- Infinitive: **kirin** (to do)
- Present stem: **k-**
- Past stem: **kir-**

#### Person and Number Agreement

Verbs agree with their subjects in person and number. Here's an example conjugation of the verb “to go” in the present tense:

Kurmanji:

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|---|---|
| 1st person | ez diçim | em diçin |
| 2nd person | tu diçî | hûn diçin |
| 3rd person | ew diçe | ew diçin |

Sorani:

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|---|---|
| 1st person | min deçim | ême deçîn |
| 2nd person | to deçît | êwe deçin |
| 3rd person | ew deçêt | ewan deçin |

#### Tense and Aspect

Kurdish has a rich system of tenses and aspects. Here are some examples:

1. Present Simple:
   Kurmanji: **Ez dixwînim.** (I read.)
   Sorani: **Min dexwênim.** (I read.)

2. Present Progressive:
   Kurmanji: **Ez dixwînim.** (I am reading.)
   Sorani: **Min xerîkî xwêndinem.** (I am reading.)

3. Past Simple:
   Kurmanji: **Min xwend.** (I read.)
   Sorani: **Min xwênd.** (I read.)

4. Present Perfect:
   Kurmanji: **Min xwendiye.** (I have read.)
   Sorani: **Min xwêndûe.** (I have read.)

5. Past Perfect:
   Kurmanji: **Min xwendibû.** (I had read.)
   Sorani: **Min xwêndibû.** (I had read.)

6. Future:
   Kurmanji: **Ez ê bixwînim.** (I will read.)
   Sorani: **Min dexwênim.** (I will read.)

#### Negation

Verbs are negated by adding the prefix **na-** or **ne-** to the verb stem:

Kurmanji:
- **Ez dixwînim.** (I read.) → **Ez naxwînim.** (I don’t read.)
- **Min xwend.** (I read.) → **Min nexwend.** (I didn't read.)

Sorani:
- **Min dexwênim.** (I read.) → **Min naxwênim.** (I don’t read.)
- **Min xwênd.** (I read.) → **Min nexwênd.** (I didn't read.)

#### Subjunctive Mood

The subjunctive mood is used for expressing wishes, possibilities, and obligations. It is formed by using the present stem with the prefix **bi-** in Kurmanji or without any prefix in Sorani:

Kurmanji:
- **Ez dixwazim bixwînim.** (I want to read.)

Sorani:
- **Min demewê bixwênim.** (I want to read.)

#### Imperative Mood

The imperative is formed using the present stem:

Kurmanji:
- Singular: **Bixwîne!** (Read!)
- Plural: **Bixwînin!** (Read!)

Sorani:
- Singular: **Bixwêne!** (Read!)
- Plural: **Bixwênin!** (Read!)

### Prepositions

Kurdish uses both prepositions and postpositions. Some common prepositions include:

Kurmanji:
- **li** (in, at)
- **bi** (with, by)
- **ji** (from)
- **bo** (for)

Sorani:
- **le** (in, at)
- **be** (with, by)
- **le** (from)
- **bo** (for)

Example:
Kurmanji: **Ez li malê me.** (I am at home.)
Sorani: **Min le mał dam.** (I am at home.)

## Syntax

Kurdish generally follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, although there is some flexibility due to the case system in Kurmanji.

### Basic Sentence Structure

1. Declarative sentence:
   Kurmanji: **Min sêv xwar.** (I ate an apple.)
   Sorani: **Min sêwêkim xward.** (I ate an apple.)

2. Question:
   Kurmanji: **Te çi xwar?** (What did you eat?)
   Sorani: **To çît xward?** (What did you eat?)

3. Negative sentence:
   Kurmanji: **Min sêv nexwar.** (I didn't eat an apple.)
   Sorani: **Min sêwêkim nexward.** (I didn't eat an apple.)

### Compound Sentences

Coordinating conjunctions are used to join clauses:

Kurmanji: **Ez çûm bajêr û min pirtûkek kirî.** (I went to the city and I bought a book.)
Sorani: **Min çûm bo şar û ktêbêkim kirî.** (I went to the city and I bought a book.)

Other common coordinating conjunctions include:

Kurmanji:
- **lê** (but)
- **yan** (or)

Sorani:
- **belam** (but)
- **yan** (or)

Example:
Kurmanji: **Ez diçim bazarê, lê tu dimînî li malê.** (I'm going to the market, but you're staying at home.)
Sorani: **Min deçim bo bazar, belam to le maḷ demênîtewe.** (I'm going to the market, but you're staying at home.)

### Complex Sentences

Subordinating conjunctions are used to create complex sentences:

Kurmanji:
- **ku** (that, which)
- **eger** (if)
- **çunku** (because)

Sorani:
- **ke** (that, which)
- **eger** (if)
- **çunke** (because)

Examples:
Kurmanji: **Ez dizanim ku tu kurdî diaxivî.** (I know that you speak Kurdish.)
Sorani: **Min dezanim ke to be kurdî qise dekeit.** (I know that you speak Kurdish.)

Kurmanji: **Eger baranê bibare, ez ê li malê bimînim.** (If it rains, I will stay at home.)
Sorani: **Eger baran bibarêt, min le maḷ demênimewe.** (If it rains, I will stay at home.)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are formed using relative pronouns:

Kurmanji: **ku** (who, which, that)
Sorani: **ke** (who, which, that)

Example:
Kurmanji: **Ew keça ku li wir rûniştiye xwişka min e.** (The girl who is sitting there is my sister.)
Sorani: **Ew kiçey ke lewê danîştûe xwişkî min e.** (The girl who is sitting there is my sister.)

### Word Order Variations

While Kurdish generally follows SOV order, other arrangements are possible for emphasis or in certain constructions:

1. OSV order for emphasis:
   Kurmanji: **Vê pirtûkê min xwend.** (This book, I read.)
   Sorani: **Em ktêbem min xwêndîyewe.** (This book, I read.)

2. SVO order in some subordinate clauses:
   Kurmanji: **Ez bawer dikim ku Azad xwendiye pirtûkê.** (I believe that Azad has read the book.)
   Sorani: **Min bawer dekem ke Azad ktêbekeyi xwêndûetewe.** (I believe that Azad has read the book.)

## Lexicon

Kurdish vocabulary is primarily of Indo-Iranian origin, with influences from Arabic, Turkish, and Persian. Some examples of common words and their origins:

1. Native Kurdish words:
   - **av** (water)
   - **çiya** (mountain)
   - **agir** (fire)
   - **berf** (snow)

2. Persian loanwords:
   - **azad** (free)
   - **reng** (color)
   - **nama** (letter)

3. Arabic loanwords:
   - **kitêb** (book)
   - **mekteb** (school)
   - **eql** (mind, intelligence)

4. Turkish loanwords:
   - **pencere** (window)
   - **çarşî** (bazaar)

### Word Formation

Kurdish employs various methods for forming new words:

1. Compounding:
   - **roj** (day) + **name** (letter) → **rojname** (newspaper)
   - **ser** (head) + **şûştin** (to wash) → **serşûştin** (shampoo)

2. Affixation:
   - Prefix **bê-** (without): **bê** + **av** (water) → **bêav** (waterless)
   - Suffix **-î** (forms abstract nouns): **kurd** + **-î** → **kurdî** (Kurdish language)

3. Derivation:
   - **xwendin** (to read) → **xwendevan** (reader)
   - **nivîsîn** (to write) → **nivîskar** (writer)

### Idiomatic Expressions

Kurdish has many idiomatic expressions. Here are a few examples:

Kurmanji:
1. **Çavê min li riya te ye.** (My eye is on your road.) 
   Meaning: I'm waiting for you / I miss you.

2. **Serê xwe nexe belayê.** (Don’t put your head in trouble.) 
   Meaning: Don’t get yourself into trouble.

Sorani:
1. **Çawim le rêgete.** (My eye is on your road.) 
   Meaning: I'm waiting for you / I miss you.

2. **Serî xot mexere belaye.** (Don’t put your head in trouble.) 
   Meaning: Don’t get yourself into trouble.

## Dialectal Variations

While we've focused on Kurmanji and Sorani, it's worth noting some key differences between these and other Kurdish dialects:

1. Phonological differences:
   - Southern Kurdish often preserves initial [w] where Kurmanji and Sorani have [v]: 
     Southern Kurdish: **war** vs. Kurmanji/Sorani: **var** (side, direction)

2. Lexical differences:
   - “to come” in different dialects:
     Kurmanji: **hatin**
     Sorani: **hatin**
     Southern Kurdish: **amayen**

3. Grammatical differences:
   - Kurmanji has a case system (direct/oblique), while Sorani doesn’t
   - Sorani uses enclitic pronouns for possession, while Kurmanji uses separate possessive adjectives

## Colloquial vs. Formal Language

Like many languages, Kurdish has differences between its colloquial and formal registers:

1. Pronunciation:
   In colloquial Kurmanji, final “-in” is often reduced to “-î”:
   Formal: **ez dizanim** (I know)
   Colloquial: **ez dizanî**

2. Vocabulary:
   Formal language tends to use more loanwords from Persian or Arabic, while colloquial speech may prefer native Kurdish words or Turkish loanwords.

3. Grammar:
   Colloquial speech may simplify some grammatical constructions. For example, in Sorani, the present perfect tense marker “-ûe” is often omitted in casual speech:
   Formal: **min xwardûe** (I have eaten)
   Colloquial: **min xwardû**

## Code-switching and Borrowing

Due to the multilingual nature of Kurdish-speaking regions, code-switching (alternating between languages) is common, especially with Arabic, Turkish, or Persian. This often occurs with:

1. Technical or modern terms
2. Expressions or idioms
3. Filler words or discourse markers

Example (Kurmanji-Turkish code-switching):
**Ez çûm marketê û min biraz meyve kirî.** (I went to the market and bought some fruit.)
Here, “market” and “biraz” (some) are Turkish words used in a Kurdish sentence.

## Conclusion

Kurdish is a rich and complex language with significant dialectal variation. Its Indo-European roots are evident in its grammar and core vocabulary, while its history of contact with other languages in the region is reflected in its loanwords and some structural features. The language continues to evolve, adapting to modern needs while maintaining its distinctive character across its various dialects.
