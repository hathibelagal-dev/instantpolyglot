# Galician

Galician (Galego) is a Romance language spoken primarily in Galicia, an autonomous community in northwestern Spain. It is closely related to Portuguese and shares many similarities with Spanish. Approximately 2.4 million people speak Galician, with most speakers being bilingual in Galician and Spanish.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Galician uses the Latin alphabet with some additional letters and diacritics. The pronunciation is generally regular, with few exceptions.

### Vowels

| Letter | Sound | IPA |
|--------|-------|-----|
| a | open | [a] |
| e | closed | [e] |
| e | open | [ɛ] |
| i | closed | [i] |
| o | closed | [o] |
| o | open | [ɔ] |
| u | closed | [u] |

The distinction between open and closed vowels is not always represented in writing. Context and word origin often determine the pronunciation.

### Consonants

| Letter | Sound | IPA |
|--------|-------|-----|
| b | voiced bilabial plosive | [b] |
| c (before e, i) | voiceless dental fricative | [θ] |
| c (elsewhere) | voiceless velar plosive | [k] |
| ch | voiceless postalveolar affricate | [tʃ] |
| d | voiced dental plosive | [d] |
| f | voiceless labiodental fricative | [f] |
| g (before e, i) | voiced velar fricative | [ɣ] |
| g (elsewhere) | voiced velar plosive | [ɡ] |
| h | silent | - |
| j | voiced postalveolar fricative | [ʒ] |
| l | alveolar lateral | [l] |
| ll | palatal lateral | [ʎ] |
| m | bilabial nasal | [m] |
| n | alveolar nasal | [n] |
| ñ | palatal nasal | [ɲ] |
| p | voiceless bilabial plosive | [p] |
| q | voiceless velar plosive | [k] |
| r | alveolar tap | [ɾ] |
| rr | alveolar trill | [r] |
| s | voiceless alveolar fricative | [s] |
| t | voiceless dental plosive | [t] |
| v | voiced bilabial fricative | [β] |
| x | voiceless velar fricative | [x] |
| z | voiceless dental fricative | [θ] |

### Stress and accent marks

Stress in Galician words generally falls on the penultimate syllable for words ending in a vowel, -n, or -s, and on the last syllable for words ending in other consonants. Exceptions are marked with an acute accent (´):

- **café** [kaˈfɛ] (coffee)
- **lámpada** [ˈlampada] (lamp)
- **difícil** [diˈfiθil] (difficult)

The acute accent is also used to distinguish between homographs:

- **bota** [ˈbɔta] (boot) vs. **botá** [boˈta] (to throw)

### Diaeresis

The diaeresis (¨) is used over 'u' in the combinations "güe" and "güi" to indicate that the 'u' is pronounced:

- **lingüística** [liŋˈɡwistika] (linguistics)

## Morphology

### Nouns

Galician nouns have two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural). Most nouns form their plural by adding -s:

- **casa** / **casas** (house / houses)
- **can** / **cans** (dog / dogs)

Nouns ending in -l, -z, or -r have special plural forms:

- **animal** / **animais** (animal / animals)
- **luz** / **luces** (light / lights)
- **muller** / **mulleres** (woman / women)

### Articles

Definite articles:

| | Masculine | Feminine |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Singular | o | a |
| Plural | os | as |

Indefinite articles:

| | Masculine | Feminine |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Singular | un | unha |
| Plural | uns | unhas |

The definite article often contracts with prepositions:

- **a** + **o** = **ao** (to the)
- **en** + **a** = **na** (in the)
- **por** + **os** = **polos** (by the)

### Adjectives

Adjectives agree in gender and number with the nouns they modify. Most adjectives have four forms:

- **alto** / **alta** / **altos** / **altas** (tall)

Some adjectives have only two forms (singular and plural):

- **feliz** / **felices** (happy)

Comparative and superlative forms are usually formed analytically:

- **máis alto** (taller)
- **o máis alto** (the tallest)

Some common adjectives have irregular comparative forms:

- **bo** (good) - **mellor** (better)
- **malo** (bad) - **peor** (worse)

## Syntax

Galician follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, but it allows for flexibility due to its inflectional nature.

### Basic sentence structure

A simple declarative sentence:

**O can ladra** (The dog barks)

Questions can be formed by inversion or using interrogative words:

**Ladra o can?** (Does the dog bark?)
**Que fai o can?** (What does the dog do?)

Negative sentences are formed by placing **non** before the verb:

**O can non ladra** (The dog doesn't bark)

### Pronouns and clitic placement

Object pronouns usually precede the conjugated verb:

**Ela dáme o libro** (She gives me the book)

In compound tenses, the pronoun can go before the auxiliary or attach to the participle:

**Ela teñome dado o libro** or **Ela tenme dado o libro** (She has given me the book)

With infinitives, gerunds, and affirmative imperatives, pronouns are attached to the end:

**Quero velo** (I want to see him)
**Estou véndoo** (I am seeing him)
**Dámo!** (Give it to me!)

### Use of the subjunctive

The subjunctive mood is used in various contexts, including:

1. After certain conjunctions:
   **Aunque chova, irei á festa** (Even if it rains, I'll go to the party)

2. In conditional sentences:
   **Se tivese tempo, estudaría máis** (If I had time, I would study more)

3. To express wishes or doubts:
   **Oxalá veña pronto** (I hope he comes soon)
   **Duvido que o saiba** (I doubt that he knows it)

### Reflexive constructions

Reflexive verbs are common in Galician:

**Lávome todas as mañás** (I wash myself every morning)

They are also used for passive-like constructions:

**Véndense libros** (Books are sold)

### Periphrastic constructions

Galician uses various periphrastic constructions to express aspectual and modal meanings:

- **estar a** + infinitive (progressive):
  **Estou a ler un libro** (I am reading a book)

- **ir** + infinitive (future intention):
  **Vou estudar mañá** (I'm going to study tomorrow)

- **acabar de** + infinitive (recent past):

## Dialectal variation

Galician has several dialects, broadly divided into three main blocks:

1. Western block
2. Central block
3. Eastern block

Some notable dialectal features include:

- Gheada: pronunciation of /g/ as [h] in western dialects
  Example: **gato** [ˈɡato] → [ˈhato] (cat)

- Seseo: merging of /θ/ and /s/ into [s] in some western coastal areas
  Example: **cen** [θen] → [sen] (hundred)

- Verb endings: variation in the 3rd person plural preterite
  Standard: **cantaron** vs. Dialectal: **cantano** (they sang)

## Phonology

### Consonant clusters

### Phonological processes

1. Vowel harmony: In some dialects, final unstressed /o/ can become /u/ when the stressed vowel is /u/ or /i/:
   **todo** [ˈtodo] → [ˈtodu] (all)

2. Metathesis: Historical sound change where consonants switched positions:
   Latin SEMPER → Galician **sempre** (always)

3. Palatalization: Historical process affecting Latin initial PL-, CL-, FL-:
   Latin PLUVIA → Galician **chuvia** [ˈtʃuβja] (rain)

4. Betacism: Merger of /b/ and /v/ sounds, both pronounced as [β]:
   **vaca** [ˈβaka] (cow), **beber** [beˈβeɾ] (to drink)

### Clitic doubling

Galician allows and sometimes requires clitic doubling, where both a pronoun and a full noun phrase appear:

### Differential object marking

Unlike Spanish, Galician doesn't use the preposition "a" for personal direct objects:

**- Viches a María? - Vin, vin** (Did you see María? - Yes, I did see her)
