# Slovenian

Slovenian (slovenščina) is a South Slavic language spoken by about 2.5 million people, primarily in Slovenia. It is closely related to Croatian and Serbian, and more distantly to other Slavic languages. The language has several distinct dialects, but a standardized form is used in official contexts and media.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Slovenian uses the Latin alphabet with some additional letters. The pronunciation is generally regular, with some exceptions.

### Vowels

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
**a** | [a]
**e** | [ɛ] or [e]
**i** | [i]
**o** | [ɔ] or [o]
**u** | [u]

Vowel length is phonemic in stressed syllables, but not typically marked in writing.

### Consonants

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
**c** | [ts]
**č** | [tʃ]
**dž** | [dʒ]
**j** | [j]
**l** | [l] or [w] (at the end of a word or syllable)
**lj** | [lj]
**nj** | [nj]
**r** | [r]
**š** | [ʃ]
**v** | [ʋ] or [w] (at the end of a word or before a consonant)
**z** | [z]
**ž** | [ʒ]

### Stress and tone

Slovenian has a pitch accent system, where stressed syllables can have either a falling or rising tone. This is not marked in standard orthography. The stress can fall on any syllable of a word.

Examples:
- **gòra** (mountain) - falling tone
- **góra** (worse) - rising tone

### Vowel reduction

In colloquial Slovenian, unstressed vowels often reduce or disappear entirely. For example:
- Standard: **delati** (to work)
- Colloquial: **delat**

### Assimilation

Voiced consonants become voiceless before voiceless consonants and at the end of words:
- **iz** [iz] (from), but **is tebe** [is tɛbɛ] (from you)
- **grad** [grat] (castle)

## Morphology

### Nouns

Slovenian nouns have three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), three numbers (singular, dual, plural), and six cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental).

Example declension patterns:

| Case | Masc. (city) | Fem. (woman) | Neut. (window) |
|------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Nom. sg. | **mest**o | **žen**a | **okn**o |
| Acc. sg. | **mest**o | **žen**o | **okn**o |
| Gen. sg. | **mest**a | **žen**e | **okn**a |
| Dat. sg. | **mest**u | **žen**i | **okn**u |
| Loc. sg. | **mest**u | **žen**i | **okn**u |
| Ins. sg. | **mest**om | **žen**o | **okn**om |
| Nom. du. | **mest**i | **žen**i | **okn**i |
| Nom. pl. | **mest**a | **žen**e | **okn**a |

Note the dual forms, which are used for exactly two of something:
- **ena žena** (one woman)
- **dve ženi** (two women)
- **tri žene** (three women)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns are declined for case and number:

| Case | 1st sg. | 2nd sg. | 3rd sg. masc. | 3rd sg. fem. | 3rd sg. neut. |
|------|---------|---------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Nom. | **jaz** | **ti** | **on** | **ona** | **ono** |
| Acc. | **mene/me** | **tebe/te** | **njega/ga** | **njo/jo** | **njega/ga** |
| Gen. | **mene/me** | **tebe/te** | **njega/ga** | **nje/je** | **njega/ga** |
| Dat. | **meni/mi** | **tebi/ti** | **njemu/mu** | **njej/ji** | **njemu/mu** |
| Loc. | **meni** | **tebi** | **njem** | **njej** | **njem** |
| Ins. | **menoj** | **teboj** | **njim** | **njo** | **njim** |

Dual and plural forms also exist. For example:
- 1st person dual: **midva** (masc.), **midve** (fem.)
- 1st person plural: **mi**

Demonstrative pronouns include:
- **ta** (this)
- **tisti** (that)

Example: **Ta hiša je velika.** (This house is big.)

### Adjectives

Adjectives agree with nouns in gender, number, and case. They typically precede the noun they modify.

Example declension for **velik** (big):

| Case | Masc. sg. | Fem. sg. | Neut. sg. |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Nom. | **velik** | **velik**a | **velik**o |
| Acc. | **velik**/(eg)a | **velik**o | **velik**o |
| Gen. | **velik**ega | **velik**e | **velik**ega |
| Dat. | **velik**emu | **velik**i | **velik**emu |
| Loc. | **velik**em | **velik**i | **velik**em |
| Ins. | **velik**im | **velik**o | **velik**im |

Comparative and superlative forms:
- Positive: **velik** (big)
- Comparative: **večji** (bigger)
- Superlative: **največji** (biggest)

Irregular comparatives exist, e.g.:
- **dober** (good) - **boljši** (better) - **najboljši** (best)

### Numbers

Cardinal numbers:

1 - **en/ena/eno**
2 - **dva** (masc.), **dve** (fem./neut.)
3 - **trije** (masc.), **tri** (fem./neut.)
4 - **štirje** (masc.), **štiri** (fem./neut.)
5 - **pet**
10 - **deset**
20 - **dvajset**
100 - **sto**
1000 - **tisoč**

Numbers decline for case when used as nouns or in certain constructions.

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding endings to the cardinal stem:
- **prvi** (first)
- **drugi** (second)
- **tretji** (third)
- **četrti** (fourth)
- **peti** (fifth)

### Verbs

Slovenian verbs are conjugated for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood. The infinitive typically ends in **-ti** or **-či**.

#### Present tense

Example conjugation of **delati** (to work):

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **dela**m | **dela**va | **dela**mo |
| 2nd | **dela**š | **dela**ta | **dela**te |
| 3rd | **dela** | **dela**ta | **dela**jo |

#### Past tense

The past tense is formed using the l-participle and the present tense of the auxiliary verb **biti** (to be). The l-participle agrees with the subject in gender and number.

Example with **delati** (to work):

| Person | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1st sg. | **delal sem** | **delala sem** | - |
| 2nd sg. | **delal si** | **delala si** | - |
| 3rd sg. | **delal je** | **delala je** | **delalo je** |

Dual and plural forms also exist.

#### Future tense

The future tense is formed using the future form of the auxiliary verb **biti** (to be) and the l-participle.

Example with **delati** (to work):

| Person | Singular |
|--------|----------|
| 1st | **bom delal/a** |
| 2nd | **boš delal/a** |
| 3rd | **bo delal/a/o** |

#### Aspect

Slovenian verbs have perfective and imperfective aspects. Perfective verbs often have a prefix:

- Imperfective: **pisati** (to write)
- Perfective: **napisati** (to write [to completion])

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed by adding specific endings to the present tense stem:

- 2nd person singular: **delaj** (work!)
- 1st person dual: **delajva** (let's [both] work!)
- 2nd person plural: **delajte** (work! [to multiple people])

#### Conditional

The conditional is formed using the particle **bi** and the l-participle:

- **Delal bi** (I would work [masc.])
- **Delala bi** (I would work [fem.])

#### Verbal noun

Verbal nouns are formed by adding **-je** to the verb stem:
- **delati** (to work) → **delanje** (working)

#### Present active participle

Formed by adding **-č** or **-joč** to the present tense stem:
- **delajoč** (working)

#### Passive participle

Formed by adding **-n** or **-t** to the verb stem:
- **delan** (being worked on)

### Adverbs

Many adverbs are formed from adjectives by adding **-o** or **-e**:
- **hiter** (fast, adj.) → **hitro** (quickly, adv.)
- **lep** (beautiful, adj.) → **lepo** (beautifully, adv.)

Comparative and superlative forms of adverbs:
- **hitro** (quickly) → **hitreje** (more quickly) → **najhitreje** (most quickly)

## Syntax

### Word order

The basic word order in Slovenian is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), but due to the case system, the order can be quite flexible for emphasis or stylistic reasons.

- SVO: **Janez bere knjigo.** (Janez reads a book.)
- OVS: **Knjigo bere Janez.** (It's Janez who reads the book.)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the particle **ali** at the beginning of a statement or by using rising intonation:
- **Ali govoriš slovensko?** (Do you speak Slovenian?)
- **Govoriš slovensko?** (You speak Slovenian? / Do you speak Slovenian?)

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns:
- **Kdo** (who)
- **Kaj** (what)
- **Kje** (where)
- **Kdaj** (when)
- **Zakaj** (why)

Example: **Kje si?** (Where are you?)

### Negation

Negation is formed by placing **ne** before the verb:
- **Ne govorim slovensko.** (I don’t speak Slovenian.)

### Clitics

Slovenian has a complex system of clitics (unstressed words that attach to other words). They follow a specific order:

Question particle → Auxiliary verb → Reflexive pronoun → Dative pronoun → Accusative pronoun

Example: **Ali si se mu jo opravičil?** (Did you apologize to him for it?)

### Pro-drop

Slovenian is a pro-drop language, meaning that pronoun subjects can be omitted when they are clear from context:
- **Sem iz Slovenije.** (I'm from Slovenia.)

The pronoun is used for emphasis or contrast:
- **Jaz sem iz Slovenije.** (_I_ am from Slovenia.)

### Reflexive verbs

Many verbs in Slovenian are reflexive, using the reflexive pronoun **se**:
- **učiti se** (to learn)
- **Učim se slovensko.** (I'm learning Slovenian.)

### Participle clauses

Slovenian uses participle clauses to express simultaneous or preceding actions:
- **Sedeč na stolu, je bral knjigo.** (Sitting on a chair, he was reading a book.)

### Conditional clauses

Conditional clauses use the conjunction **če** (if):
- **Če bo deževalo, bomo ostali doma.** (If it rains, we'll stay at home.)

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by the relative pronoun **ki**:
- **To je knjiga, ki sem jo kupil včeraj.** (This is the book that I bought yesterday.)

## Colloquial Slovenian

Colloquial Slovenian differs significantly from the standard language. Some key features include:

1. Vowel reduction:
   - Standard: **delati** (to work)
   - Colloquial: **delat**

2. Different verb forms:
   - Standard: **bom delal** (I will work)
   - Colloquial: **bom delou**

3. Simplified case system:
   - Standard: **z avtom** (by car, instrumental)
   - Colloquial: **z avtomobilom**

4. Loanwords from neighboring languages:
   - German: **šraufenciger** instead of **izvijač** (screwdriver)

5. Different pronouns:
   - Standard: **kaj** (what)
   - Colloquial (in some regions): **kva**

## Dialects

Slovenian has a rich dialectal landscape, with over 40 distinct dialects grouped into 7 dialect groups:

1. Carinthian
2. Upper Carniolan
3. Lower Carniolan
4. Styrian
5. Pannonian
6. Littoral
7. Rovte

These dialects can differ significantly in vocabulary, pronunciation, and even grammar. For example:

- Standard: **Ne vem.** (I don’t know.)
- Ljubljana dialect: **Ne vem.** [nəˈʋeːm]
- Prekmurje dialect: **Ne znan.** [nɛ ˈznaːn]

## Vocabulary

Slovenian vocabulary has been influenced by various languages throughout its history:

1. German: due to historical proximity and interaction
   Example: **šola** (school) from German “Schule”

2. Italian: particularly in the western regions
   Example: **bonbon** (candy) from Italian “bonbon”

3. Hungarian: especially in the northeastern regions
   Example: **čizma** (boot) from Hungarian “csizma”

4. Serbo-Croatian: due to shared history in Yugoslavia
   Example: **čevapčiči** (a type of grilled meat dish)

5. English: particularly in modern technology and pop culture
   Example: **menedžer** (manager)

Many Slavic roots are shared across Slovenian and other Slavic languages, which can be helpful for learners familiar with other languages in this family.

## Slovenian literature and culture

Slovenian has a rich literary tradition dating back to the 16th century. Some key figures in Slovenian literature include:

1. France Prešeren (1800-1849): Considered the greatest Slovenian poet. His poem “Zdravljica” is now the national anthem.

2. Ivan Cankar (1876-1918): A prominent modernist writer known for his critical portrayal of Slovenian society.

3. Srečko Kosovel (1904-1926): An avant-garde poet whose work gained recognition posthumously.

Contemporary Slovenian literature continues to thrive, with authors like Drago Jančar and Aleš Šteger gaining international recognition.

## Slovenian in the digital age

Slovenian has adapted well to the digital age:

1. Keyboard layouts: Slovenian-specific keyboard layouts are available on most operating systems, allowing for easy typing of special characters like č, š, and ž.

2. Localization: Many popular software applications and websites have been localized into Slovenian, including major operating systems, office suites, and social media platforms.

3. Machine translation: Slovenian is supported by major machine translation services, although the quality can vary due to the language's complexity and relatively small speaker base.

4. Voice recognition and text-to-speech: These technologies are available for Slovenian, though they may not be as advanced as for more widely spoken languages.

5. Corpus linguistics: The development of large Slovenian language corpora, such as the Gigafida corpus, has facilitated linguistic research and natural language processing tasks.

## Phonology

### Vowel system

Slovenian has a system of 8 vowel phonemes:

| Phoneme | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| /a/ | Open front unrounded | **mati** (mother) |
| /ɛ/ | Open-mid front unrounded | **pet** (five) |
| /e/ | Close-mid front unrounded | **leto** (year) |
| /i/ | Close front unrounded | **mir** (peace) |
| /ɔ/ | Open-mid back rounded | **pošta** (post office) |
| /o/ | Close-mid back rounded | **nos** (nose) |
| /u/ | Close back rounded | **ruka** (hand) |
| /ə/ | Mid central | **pes** (dog) |

The vowels /e/ and /o/ can be either long or short, while /ə/ is always short.

### Consonant system

Slovenian has 21 consonant phonemes:

| /r/ | Alveolar trill | **roka** (hand) |
| /ʋ/ | Labiodental approximant | **voda** (water) |

### Phonological processes

1. Final devoicing: Voiced obstruents are devoiced at the end of words.
   Example: **grad** [grat] (castle)

2. Vowel reduction: In unstressed syllables, vowels can be reduced or even dropped in colloquial speech.
   Example: **delati** [ˈdeːlati] → [ˈdeːlət] (to work)

3. Assimilation: Consonants often assimilate in voicing to the following consonant.
   Example: **z bratom** [z‿ˈbraːtɔm] → [zbraːtɔm] (with brother)

4. L-vocalization: The phoneme /l/ is realized as [w] at the end of a word or syllable.
   Example: **delal** [ˈdeːlaw] (worked, masc.)

## Morphophonemic alternations

Slovenian exhibits various morphophonemic alternations, where the form of a morpheme changes depending on its phonological environment. Some common alternations include:

1. Palatalization: Velar consonants change to palatal consonants before certain suffixes.
   - **roka** (hand) → **ročica** (little hand)
   - **noga** (leg) → **nožica** (little leg)

2. Iotation: Certain consonants change when followed by a /j/ sound.
   - **hoditi** (to walk) → **hoja** (walking)
   - **voziti** (to drive) → **vožnja** (driving)

3. Vowel alternations: Some vowels alternate in related words or different forms of the same word.
   - **pes** (dog) → **psa** (dog's, genitive)
   - **čas** (time) → **česen** (temporal)

4. Epenthesis: In some cases, a vowel is inserted to break up consonant clusters.
   - **pesem** (song) → **pesmi** (songs)

## Verb aspect

Verb aspect is a crucial feature of Slovenian verbs. Most verbs come in aspectual pairs:

1. Imperfective: Expresses ongoing, habitual, or repeated actions.
2. Perfective: Expresses completed or single actions.

Examples:
- Imperfective: **pisati** (to write, ongoing action)
- Perfective: **napisati** (to write, completed action)

Aspect can be changed through various means:
1. Prefixation: Adding a prefix to an imperfective verb often makes it perfective.
   - **pisati** (to write, impf.) → **napisati** (to write, pf.)

2. Suffixation: Adding or changing a suffix can change the aspect.
   - **kupiti** (to buy, pf.) → **kupovati** (to buy, impf.)

3. Suppletion: Some verbs use completely different roots for different aspects.
   - **reči** (to say, pf.) - **govoriti** (to say, impf.)

## Verb classes

Slovenian verbs can be divided into several classes based on their conjugation patterns. Here are some major classes:

1. -ati verbs:
   **delati** (to work)
   - Present: delam, delaš, dela, delava, delata, delajo
   - L-participle: delal, delala, delalo

2. -iti verbs:
   **govoriti** (to speak)
   - Present: govorim, govoriš, govori, govoriva, govorita, govorijo
   - L-participle: govoril, govorila, govorilo

3. -eti verbs:
   **živeti** (to live)
   - Present: živim, živiš, živi, živiva, živita, živijo
   - L-participle: živel, živela, živelo

4. -niti verbs:
   **dvigniti** (to lift)
   - Present: dvignem, dvigneš, dvigne, dvigneva, dvigneta, dvignejo
   - L-participle: dvignil, dvignila, dvignilo

5. Irregular verbs:
   **biti** (to be)
   - Present: sem, si, je, sva, sta, so
   - L-participle: bil, bila, bilo
