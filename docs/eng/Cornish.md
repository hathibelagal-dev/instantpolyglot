# Cornish

Cornish (Kernewek) is a Celtic language of the Brythonic branch, closely related to Welsh and Breton. It was traditionally spoken in Cornwall, the southwestern peninsula of Great Britain. The language declined significantly by the 18th century but has undergone a revival since the early 20th century. Today, it is recognized as a minority language in the UK and has a small but growing community of speakers.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Cornish uses the Latin alphabet with some additional letters. The pronunciation can vary depending on the specific orthography used, as there are several competing spelling systems. This overview will focus on the Standard Written Form (SWF), which was introduced in 2008 as an attempt to unify the various orthographies.

### Vowels

| Letter | Sound | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| a | [a] or [æ] | **tas** [tas] (father) |
| e | [ɛ] or [e] | **den** [dɛn] (man) |
| i | [ɪ] or [i] | **mis** [mɪs] (month) |
| o | [ɔ] or [o] | **nos** [nɔs] (night) |
| u | [ʌ] or [y] | **du** [dy] (black) |
| y | [ɪ] or [ə] | **bys** [bɪs] (world) |

Long vowels are typically indicated by doubling the letter or adding a circumflex:

| Letter | Sound | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| aa or â | [a:] | **mââm** [ma:m] (mother) |
| ee or ê | [e:] | **gwrêg** [gwe:g] (wife) |
| ii or î | [i:] | **mîl** [mi:l] (thousand) |
| oo or ô | [o:] | **côs** [ko:s] (wood) |
| uu or û | [y:] | **dûn** [dy:n] (deep) |

### Consonants

Most consonants are pronounced similarly to English, with some notable exceptions:

| Letter | Sound | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| c | [k] | **cath** [kaθ] (cat) |
| ch | [tʃ] | **chî** [tʃi:] (house) |
| dh | [ð] | **medhek** [ˈmɛðək] (doctor) |
| gh | [x] or [h] | **ughel** [ˈʌxəl] (high) |
| hw | [ʍ] | **hwath** [ʍaθ] (still) |
| j | [dʒ] | **jydh** [dʒɪð] (day) |
| th | [θ] | **eth** [ɛθ] (eight) |

### Stress

In Cornish, stress typically falls on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable:

- **bara** [ˈbara] (bread)
- **dyskador** [dɪsˈkadɔr] (teacher)

However, there are exceptions, particularly with loanwords and certain suffixes. In the SWF, an acute accent is sometimes used to indicate stress on the final syllable:

- **kanow** [ˈkanɔw] (songs)
- **kanowé** [kanɔˈwe] (songs, emphatic form)

## Morphology

### Nouns

Cornish nouns have two genders: masculine and feminine. They can be singular or plural, and there are also collective nouns and singulative forms.

#### Gender

Gender in Cornish is not always predictable, but there are some patterns:

- Masculine nouns often end in consonants: **ki** (dog), **den** (man)
- Feminine nouns often end in -a or -eth: **mora** (tomorrow), **gwrygeth** (wife)

#### Plural formation

There are several ways to form plurals in Cornish:

1. Adding -ow (most common): 
   - **kath** (cat) → **kathow** (cats)
   - **pen** (head) → **pennow** (heads)

2. Internal vowel change:
   - **mab** (son) → **mebyon** (sons)
   - **margh** (horse) → **mergh** (horses)

3. Adding -yon or -ion (often for people):
   - **mêstres** (mistress) → **mêstresyon** (mistresses)
   - **den** (man) → **tus** (men, people) (irregular)

4. Adding -i or -y:
   - **bran** (crow) → **brini** (crows)
   - **logosen** (mouse) → **logosi** (mice)

#### Collective and singulative nouns

Some nouns in Cornish are collective by default and require a suffix to form the singular:

- **gwynn** (trees) → **gwynnen** (a tree)
- **ÿs** (corn) → **ÿsen** (a grain of corn)

### Articles

Cornish has both definite and indefinite articles:

- Definite article: **an** (the)
  - **an ki** (the dog)
  - **an gath** (the cat)

- Indefinite article: **unn** (a, an) before vowels, **un** before consonants
  - **unn arghans** (a silver)
  - **un ki** (a dog)

The definite article causes mutations in certain contexts (see Mutations section).

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Cornish typically follow the noun they modify:

- **ki bras** (big dog)
- **kath vyghan** (small cat)

Some common adjectives can precede the noun:

- **hen dre** (old town)
- **da vara** (good bread)

Adjectives do not agree in gender or number with the noun they modify, but they can undergo mutations.

#### Comparison of adjectives

Comparative and superlative forms are formed analytically:

- Positive: **bras** (big)
- Comparative: **brassa** (bigger)
- Superlative: **an vrassa** (the biggest)

Example:
- **Yma ow chi brassa ages dha ji.** (My house is bigger than your house.)
- **Hemm yw an chi brassa yn tre.** (This is the biggest house in town.)

### Pronouns

#### Personal pronouns

Cornish has different sets of pronouns for subject, object, and possessive forms:

| Person | Subject | Object | Possessive |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1sg | **my** | **vy** | **ow** |
| 2sg | **ty** | **ty** | **dha** |
| 3sg.m | **ev** | **e** | **y** |
| 3sg.f | **hi** | **hi** | **hy** |
| 1pl | **ni** | **ni** | **agan** |
| 2pl | **hwi** | **hwi** | **agas** |
| 3pl | **i** | **ans** | **aga** |

Examples:
- **My a wel hi.** (I see her.)
- **Hi a wel vy.** (She sees me.)
- **Ow chi yw bras.** (My house is big.)

#### Demonstrative pronouns

- **hemma** (this)
- **honna** (that)
- **an re ma** (these)
- **an re na** (those)

Example:
- **Hemma yw ow chi.** (This is my house.)
- **An re na yw kathow.** (Those are cats.)

### Verbs

Cornish verbs have a rich system of tenses, aspects, and moods. They conjugate for person and number, and can undergo mutations in certain contexts.

#### Present tense

The present tense can be formed in two ways:

1. Using the particle **a** + verb:
   - **My a gar** (I love)
   - **Ty a gar** (You love)
   - **Ev a gar** (He loves)

2. Using the verb directly after the subject (less common):
   - **My gar** (I love)
   - **Ty gar** (You love)
   - **Ev gar** (He loves)

#### Past tense

The past tense is formed by adding specific endings to the verb stem:

- **My a garas** (I loved)
- **Ty a garas** (You loved)
- **Ev a garas** (He loved)

#### Future tense

The future tense uses the particle **a wra** (will) followed by the verb in its infinitive form:

- **My a wra kara** (I will love)
- **Ty a wra kara** (You will love)
- **Ev a wra kara** (He will love)

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed using the bare stem of the verb:

- **Kar!** (Love!)
- **Gwra!** (Do!)

For negative commands, use **na** before the verb:

- **Na wra henna!** (Don’t do that!)

#### Verbal nouns

Cornish uses verbal nouns extensively, similar to the -ing form in English:

- **redya** (to read, reading)
- **skrifa** (to write, writing)

These are used in various constructions, such as the present progressive:

- **Yth esov vy ow redya.** (I am reading.)

#### Irregular verbs

Some common verbs have irregular conjugations:

**bos** (to be):
- Present: **ov**, **os**, **yw**, **on**, **owgh**, **yns**
- Past: **en**, **es**, **o**, **en**, **ewgh**, **ens**

**mynnes** (to want):
- Present: **mynav**, **mynnydh**, **mynn**, **mynnyn**, **mynnowgh**, **mynnons**

**gul** (to do, to make):
- Present: **gwrav**, **gwredh**, **gwra**, **gwren**, **gwrewgh**, **gwrons**

### Mutations

Cornish, like other Celtic languages, features initial consonant mutations. There are three types of mutations in Cornish:

1. Soft mutation (lenition)
2. Hard mutation (provection)
3. Mixed mutation (aspirate mutation)

#### Soft mutation

Soft mutation occurs in various grammatical contexts, including:

- After the article **an** for feminine singular nouns
- After certain prepositions
- After possessive adjectives

Changes:
- p → b, t → d, k → g
- b → v, d → dh, g → (disappears)
- m → v
- gw → w

Example:
- **penn** (head) → **y benn** (his head)
- **tas** (father) → **dha das** (your father)

#### Hard mutation

Hard mutation occurs mainly after the possessive adjective **ow** (my):

Changes:
- b → p, d → t, g → k
- m → wh

Example:
- **bugh** (cow) → **ow fugh** (my cow)
- **dorn** (hand) → **ow thorn** (my hand)

#### Mixed mutation

Mixed mutation occurs after certain words, including **ow** (my) before words beginning with g- or gw-:

Changes:
- g → h
- gw → hw

Example:
- **garth** (garden) → **ow harth** (my garden)
- **gweli** (bed) → **ow hweli** (my bed)

## Syntax

### Word order

The basic word order in Cornish is VSO (Verb-Subject-Object):

- **Redya an den an lyver.** (The man reads the book.)

However, SVO order is also common, especially in more casual speech:

- **An den a redya an lyver.** (The man reads the book.)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the particle **a** at the beginning of the sentence:

- **A wrewgh hwi kara koffi?** (Do you like coffee?)

Wh-questions use interrogative words at the beginning of the sentence:

- **Pyth yw hemma?** (What is this?)
- **Ple'ma dha ji?** (Where is your house?)

### Negation

Negation is formed using the particle **ny** before the verb:

- **Ny wonn.** (I don’t know.)
- **Ny wra ev dos.** (He won’t come.)

In the imperative, **na** is used:

- **Na wra mos!** (Don’t go!)

### Possession

Possession can be expressed in several ways:

1. Using possessive adjectives:
   - **ow chi** (my house)
   - **dha gi** (your dog)

2. Using the preposition **a**:
   - **ki an den** (the man's dog)

3. Using the verb **bos** (to be) with **dhe** (to):
   - **Yma chi dhe Varia.** (Maria has a house. Lit: There is a house to Maria.)

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by the particle **a**:

- **An den a welav** (The man whom I see)
- **An gath a gar pesk** (The cat that likes fish)

## Vocabulary

## Aspects of Cornish Grammar

### Verbal Particles

Cornish uses several verbal particles that precede the verb in certain constructions:

### Aspect

Cornish has a rich system of verbal aspects, allowing for nuanced expression of how an action occurs over time:

1. Simple aspect:
   - **My a redyas an lyver.** (I read the book)

2. Habitual aspect:
   - **My a wreg mos dhe'n skol pub dy.** (I go to school every day)

### Mutations in Practice

Let's explore how mutations work in various contexts:

1. After the definite article **an**:
   - **kath** (cat) → **an gath** (the cat) [feminine noun, soft mutation]
   - **ki** (dog) → **an ki** (the dog) [masculine noun, no mutation]

2. After possessive adjectives:
   - **tas** (father) → **ow thas** (my father) [hard mutation]
   - **mam** (mother) → **dha vam** (your mother) [soft mutation]
   - **chi** (house) → **y ji** (his house) [soft mutation]
   - **koweth** (friend) → **hy howeth** (her friend) [mixed mutation]

3. After certain prepositions:
   - **dhe** + **tir** (land) → **dhe dir** (to land) [soft mutation]
   - **a** + **Kernow** (Cornwall) → **a Gernow** (from Cornwall) [soft mutation]

4. In feminine singular nouns after adjectives:
   - **bras** (big) + **kath** (cat) → **kath vras** (big cat) [soft mutation]

## Dialectal Variations

Although modern revived Cornish aims for standardization, historical Cornish had several dialects. The main historical dialect divisions were:

1. West Cornish: Spoken in Penwith and Kerrier
2. Central Cornish: Spoken in Powder and Pydar
3. East Cornish: Spoken in Trigg and East Cornwall

Some differences included:

- Pronunciation: e.g., the word for “head” was pronounced [pen] in the west but [pdn] in the east.
- Vocabulary: Some words were specific to certain regions.
- Grammar: Minor grammatical differences existed between regions.

## Cornish Literature

Despite its decline, Cornish has a rich literary tradition:

1. **Pascon agan Arluth** (The Passion of our Lord): A 14th-century miracle play.

2. **Ordinalia**: A cycle of three mystery plays from the 14th century.

3. **Beunans Meriasek** (The Life of Saint Meriasek): A saint's play from 1504.

4. **Gwreans an Bys** (The Creation of the World): A 16th-century miracle play.

5. **Jowan Chy an Horth** (John of Chyannor): A folk tale written down in the 17th century.

Modern Cornish literature has seen a revival, with authors producing new works in the language.

## Cornish in Modern Context

### Revival Efforts

The revival of Cornish began in the early 20th century:

1. Henry Jenner's “Handbook of the Cornish Language” (1904) sparked interest.
2. Robert Morton Nance's “Unified Cornish” orthography in the 1920s provided a standardized system.
3. The establishment of Gorsedh Kernow in 1928 promoted Cornish culture and language.
4. Ken George's “Kernewek Kemmyn” orthography in 1986 attempted phonetic accuracy.
5. Nicholas Williams' “Unified Cornish Revised” in 1995 aimed to balance historical accuracy and learnability.
6. The Standard Written Form (SWF) was developed in 2008 to unify different orthographies.

### Current Status

Cornish has gained recognition in recent years:

- In 2002, Cornish was recognized under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
- In 2010, UNESCO changed its classification of Cornish from “extinct” to “critically endangered”.

### Learning and Using Cornish Today

Various resources are available for learning Cornish:

1. Language courses offered by organizations like Kesva an Taves Kernewek.
2. Online resources such as apps and websites dedicated to Cornish language learning.
3. Cornish language events and gatherings.

Cornish is used in various contexts today:

- Street signs in Cornwall often feature Cornish alongside English.
- Some schools in Cornwall offer Cornish language classes.
- There are Cornish language radio programs and podcasts.
- Social media platforms have Cornish language communities.

## Challenges and Future of Cornish

Despite revival efforts, Cornish faces several challenges:

1. Limited number of fluent speakers (estimated at around 500-600 as of 2021).
2. Lack of widespread everyday use in Cornwall.
3. Debates over standardization and authenticity of revived forms.
4. Limited resources compared to more widely spoken languages.

However, there are positive signs for the future of Cornish:

1. Growing interest among younger generations.
2. Increasing visibility in public spaces and media.
3. Support from local and national government for language preservation efforts.
4. Integration of Cornish into cultural events and tourism initiatives.

The future of Cornish will depend on continued efforts to promote its use, develop learning resources, and integrate it into everyday life in Cornwall and beyond.
