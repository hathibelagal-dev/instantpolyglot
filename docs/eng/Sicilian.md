# Sicilian

Sicilian (Sicilianu) is a Romance language spoken by around 4.7 million people, primarily on the island of Sicily and in southern and central Calabria in Italy. It is considered distinct from Standard Italian and has its own rich literary tradition. Sicilian is not officially recognized as a minority language in Italy, despite efforts by linguistic advocacy groups.

## Phonology

### Vowels

Sicilian has a simple five-vowel system:

| Vowel | IPA | Example |
|-------|-----|---------|
| a | [a] | **pani** [ˈpani] (bread) |
| e | [ɛ] | **petra** [ˈpɛtra] (stone) |
| i | [i] | **filu** [ˈfilu] (thread) |
| o | [ɔ] | **oru** [ˈɔru] (gold) |
| u | [u] | **lupu** [ˈlupu] (wolf) |

Unlike Standard Italian, Sicilian does not distinguish between open and closed “e” and “o” sounds.

### Consonants

Sicilian has a rich consonant inventory, including some sounds not found in Standard Italian:

| Consonant | IPA | Example |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| b | [b] | **bbeddu** [ˈbːɛdːu] (beautiful) |
| c | [k] | **cannila** [kanˈnila] (candle) |
| d | [d] | **deci** [ˈdɛtʃi] (ten) |
| dd | [dː] | **addumannari** [adːumanˈnari] (to ask) |
| f | [f] | **focu** [ˈfɔku] (fire) |
| g | [ɡ] | **gatta** [ˈɡatːa] (cat) |
| gh | [ɡ] | **ghiacciu** [ˈɡjatːʃu] (ice) |
| j | [j] | **jùdici** [ˈjuditʃi] (judge) |
| l | [l] | **luni** [ˈluni] (Monday) |
| m | [m] | **matri** [ˈmatri] (mother) |
| n | [n] | **notti** [ˈnɔtːi] (night) |
| p | [p] | **pani** [ˈpani] (bread) |
| r | [r] | **riali** [riˈali] (royal) |
| s | [s] | **suli** [ˈsuli] (sun) |
| t | [t] | **tempu** [ˈtɛmpu] (time) |
| v | [v] | **vinu** [ˈvinu] (wine) |
| z | [dz] | **zorba** [ˈdzɔrba] (blind) |

Additionally, Sicilian has several consonant clusters and digraphs:

| Cluster/Digraph | IPA | Example |
|-----------------|-----|---------|
| ch | [k] | **chinu** [ˈkinu] (full) |
| ci | [tʃ] | **ciuri** [ˈtʃuri] (flower) |
| gi | [dʒ] | **giugnettu** [dʒuɲˈɲɛtːu] (July) |
| sc | [ʃ] | **sceccu** [ˈʃɛkːu] (donkey) |
| tr | [tɾ] | **tronu** [ˈtɾɔnu] (thunder) |

### Phonological processes

1. Raddoppiamento (Consonant doubling): Initial consonants are often doubled in pronunciation, especially after vowels:
   **a casa** [a kˈkasa] (at home)

2. Vowel breaking: Latin “e” and “o” often become diphthongs in Sicilian:
   Latin “petra” > Sicilian **petra** [ˈpjɛtra] (stone)

3. Metathesis: Some consonant clusters undergo metathesis:
   Latin “capra” > Sicilian **crapa** [ˈkrapa] (goat)

4. Betacism: Latin “v” often becomes “b” in Sicilian:
   Latin “vita” > Sicilian **vita** [ˈbita] (life)

## Morphology

### Nouns

Sicilian nouns have two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural). Unlike Italian, Sicilian does not have a neuter gender.

Typical noun endings:

| Gender | Singular | Plural | Example |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| Masculine | -u | -i | **libbru** / **libbri** (book/s) |

1. Masculine nouns ending in -i:
   **luni** (Monday) - plural: **luni**

   **notti** (night) - plural: **notti**

3. Invariable nouns:
   **tempu** (time/weather) - plural: **tempu**

Present tense conjugation of **parrari** (to speak):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **parru** | **parramu** |

Subjunctive mood, present tense of **parrari**:

### Participles

### Adverbs

Many adverbs are formed by adding -menti to the feminine form of adjectives:

Some common irregular adverbs:
**assai** (very, much)

## Syntax

### Word Order

Sicilian generally follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, similar to Italian:

**Iu mangiu a pasta** (I eat pasta)

However, the word order can be more flexible due to the case system:

**A pasta mangiu iu** (It's me who eats pasta)

### Negation

Negation is typically formed by placing **nun** before the verb:

**Iu nun mangiu a pasta** (I don’t eat pasta)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are often formed by intonation alone:

**Tu mangi a pasta?** (Do you eat pasta?)

Alternatively, the particle **chi** can be used:

**Chi tu mangi a pasta?** (Do you eat pasta?)

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns:

**Cu' è?** (Who is it?)
**Chi cosa fai?** (What are you doing?)
**Unni vai?** (Where are you going?)

### Copula

The verb **essiri** (to be) is used as the main copula:

**Iu sugnu sicilianu** (I am Sicilian)
**Idda è bedda** (She is beautiful)

### Reflexive Verbs

Reflexive verbs are common in Sicilian:

**Iu mi lavu** (I wash myself)
**Iddu si vesti** (He dresses himself)

### Auxiliary Verbs

The main auxiliary verbs are **aviri** (to have) and **essiri** (to be):

**Aiu mangiatu** (I have eaten)
**Sugnu vinutu** (I have come)

### Clitic Pronouns

Sicilian uses clitic pronouns that attach to verbs:

**Dammillu** (Give it to me) - from **dari** (to give) + **mi** (to me) + **lu** (it)

### Passive Voice

Passive constructions are formed using **essiri** + past participle:

**A pasta fu mangiata** (The pasta was eaten)

## Literary Tradition

Sicilian has a rich literary tradition dating back to the 13th century. The Sicilian School of poetry, under Frederick II, was influential in the development of Italian literature.

Notable Sicilian writers include:

- Andrea Camilleri (1925-2019): His detective novels feature dialogue in Sicilian

## Modern Usage

While Italian is the official language of education and administration in Sicily, Sicilian remains widely spoken in informal contexts. Efforts are being made to preserve and promote the language:

1. Some schools offer optional Sicilian language courses
2. Local TV and radio stations broadcast some programs in Sicilian
3. There are Sicilian language newspapers and websites
4. Social media has become a platform for Sicilian language use and promotion

However, like many regional languages, Sicilian faces challenges from the dominance of standard Italian and global languages like English.
