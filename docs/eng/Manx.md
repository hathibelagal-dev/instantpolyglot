# Manx

Manx (Gaelg or Gailck) is a Goidelic Celtic language historically spoken on the Isle of Man. It is closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic. The last native speaker of traditional Manx died in 1974, but revitalization efforts have led to a small community of new speakers.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Manx uses a modified version of the Latin alphabet. The spelling system is based on English orthographic conventions, which can make it appear quite different from Irish and Scottish Gaelic.

### Vowels

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| a | [a], [æ], [ɛ] |
| e | [ɛ], [e] |
| i | [ɪ], [i] |
| o | [ɔ], [o] |
| u | [ʊ], [u] |
| y | [ɪ], [ə] |

Vowel length is not consistently marked in the orthography. In some cases, a following 'h' indicates a long vowel:

**çhee** [tʃiː] "hot"
**lhong** [lɔːŋ] "ship"

### Consonants

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| b | [b] |
| c | [k] |
| ç | [tʃ] |
| d | [d] |
| f | [f] |
| g | [ɡ] |
| h | [h] |
| j | [dʒ] |
| k | [k] |
| l | [l] |
| m | [m] |
| n | [n] |
| p | [p] |
| q | [k] |
| r | [r] |
| s | [s] |
| sh | [ʃ] |
| t | [t] |
| v | [v] |
| w | [w] |

Some consonant combinations:

| Spelling | Sound |
|----------|-------|
| ch | [x] |
| gh | [ɣ] |
| lh | [l] (but causes lenition of the preceding vowel) |
| mh | [v] |
| ph | [f] |
| th | [θ] |

### Stress

Stress in Manx is generally on the first syllable of a word:

****bwoailley** [ˈbwɔːlʲə] "beat"
**cooish** [ˈkuːʃ] "matter, affair"

However, there are exceptions, particularly in loanwords:

**abyl** [əˈbɪl] "able"
**ashoon** [əˈʃuːn] "nation"

### Initial mutations

Like other Celtic languages, Manx has a system of initial consonant mutations. There are two types of mutation in Manx:

1. Lenition (or soft mutation)
2. Eclipsis (or nasalization)

Examples of lenition:

| Original | Lenited | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| b | v | **ben** [ben] "woman" → **e ven** [e ven] "his wife" |
| c | ch | **cass** [kas] "foot" → **my chass** [mə xas] "my foot" |
| d | gh | **dooinney** [duːnʲə] "man" → **y ghooinney** [ə ɣuːnʲə] "the man" |
| f | - | **fer** [fɛr] "man" → **e er** [e ɛr] "his man" |
| g | gh | **glioon** [ɡlʲuːn] "knee" → **my ghlioon** [mə ɣlʲuːn] "my knee" |
| m | v | **moddey** [mɔːðə] "dog" → **y voddey** [ə vɔːðə] "the dog" |
| p | ph | **paitçhey** [pætʃə] "child" → **e phaitçhey** [e fætʃə] "his child" |
| q | wh | **quoi** [kwi] "who" → **y whoi** [ə hwi] "to whom" |
| t | h | **thie** [tai] "house" → **my hie** [mə hai] "my house" |

Examples of eclipsis:

| Original | Eclipsed | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| b | m | **bean** [bjan] "woman" → **ny mraane** [nə mrɑːnə] "the women" |
| c | g | **cass** [kas] "foot" → **ny gassyn** [nə ɡasən] "the feet" |
| d | n | **dorrys** [dɔrəs] "door" → **ny norryssyn** [nə nɔrəsən] "the doors" |
| f | v | **fer** [fɛr] "man" → **ny verin** [nə vɛrɪn] "the men" |
| g | n | **glioon** [ɡlʲuːn] "knee" → **ny nglioonyn** [nə ŋlʲuːnən] "the knees" |
| p | b | **paitçhey** [pætʃə] "child" → **ny baitçhyn** [nə bætʃən] "the children" |
| t | d | **thie** [tai] "house" → **ny dhieyn** [nə ðaiən] "the houses" |

## Morphology

### Nouns

Manx nouns have two genders (masculine and feminine), two numbers (singular and plural), and four cases (nominative, vocative, genitive, and dative). However, case distinctions are largely lost in modern Manx, with only remnants in certain constructions.

#### Gender

Gender in Manx is not always predictable, but there are some general patterns:

- Masculine nouns often end in a broad consonant: **fer** "man", **moddey** "dog"
- Feminine nouns often end in a slender consonant or -ag: **ben** "woman", **caillagh** "old woman"

#### Plural formation

Manx has various ways to form plurals:

1. Adding -yn:
   **thie** "house" → **thieyn** "houses"
   **cayt** "cat" → **caytyn** "cats"

2. Slenderizing the final consonant and adding -yn:
   **fer** "man" → **fir** "men"
   **mac** "son" → **mec** "sons"

3. Adding -aghyn:
   **scoill** "school" → **scoillaghyn** "schools"
   **glioon** "knee" → **glioonaghyn** "knees"

4. Irregular plurals:
   **ben** "woman" → **mraane** "women"
   **dooinney** "man" → **deiney** "men"

#### Definite article

The definite article in Manx is **yn** (singular) or **ny** (plural). It causes lenition of feminine singular nouns and eclipsis of plural nouns:

**yn dooinney** "the man"
**yn ven** "the woman" (lenition of **ben**)
**ny verin** "the men" (eclipsis of **fir**)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Manx:

| Person | Subject | Object | Emphatic |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| 1sg | **mee** | **mee** | **mish** |
| 2sg | **oo** | **oo** | **uss** |
| 3sg m | **eh** | **eh** | **eshyn** |
| 3sg f | **ee** | **ee** | **ish** |
| 1pl | **shin** | **shin** | **shinyn** |
| 2pl | **shiu** | **shiu** | **shiuish** |
| 3pl | **ad** | **ad** | **adsyn** |

Possessive pronouns:

| Person | Pronoun | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 1sg | **my** | **my hie** "my house" |
| 2sg | **dty** | **dty hie** "your house" |
| 3sg m | **e** | **e hie** "his house" |
| 3sg f | **e** | **e thie** "her house" |
| 1pl | **nyn** | **nyn dhie** "our house" |
| 2pl | **nyn** | **nyn dhie** "your house" |
| 3pl | **nyn** | **nyn dhie** "their house" |

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Manx usually follow the noun they modify:

**dooinney mooar** "big man"
**ben aalin** "beautiful woman"

Adjectives agree with the noun in number and gender. For feminine singular nouns, adjectives are lenited:

**ben vooar** "big woman" (lenition of **mooar**)

Plural adjectives often add -ey or undergo other changes:

**deiney mooarey** "big men"
**mraane aalinney** "beautiful women"

Comparative and superlative forms are formed analytically:

**mooar** "big"
**ny s'moo** "bigger" (comparative)
**yn fer s'moo** "the biggest" (superlative)

### Verbs

Manx verbs have a rich system of tenses and moods. The basic verb forms are:

1. Verbal noun (equivalent to infinitive)
2. Present tense
3. Past tense
4. Future tense
5. Conditional

#### Verbal noun

The verbal noun is the basic form of the verb and is used in many constructions:

**goll** "going"
**çheet** "coming"
**gra** "saying"

#### Present tense

The present tense is formed using the particle **ta** (negative **cha nel**) followed by the subject and the verbal noun:

**Ta mee goll** "I am going"
**Cha nel mee goll** "I am not going"

For "to be," the present tense forms are irregular:

**Ta mee** "I am"
**T'ou** "You are"
**T'eh** "He is"
**T'ee** "She is"
**Ta shin** "We are"
**Ta shiu** "You (pl) are"
**T'ad** "They are"

#### Past tense

The past tense is formed by leniting the initial consonant of the verb (if possible) and adding appropriate endings:

**hie mee** "I went" (from **goll**)
**haink mee** "I came" (from **çheet**)
**dooyrt mee** "I said" (from **gra**)

The past tense of "to be" is **va**:

**Va mee** "I was"
**V'ou** "You were"
**V'eh** "He was"
**V'ee** "She was"
**Va shin** "We were"
**Va shiu** "You (pl) were"
**V'ad** "They were"

#### Future tense

The future tense is formed using the particle **nee** (negative **cha jean**) followed by the subject and the verbal noun:

**Nee'm goll** "I will go"
**Cha jean mee goll** "I will not go"

For "to be," the future tense forms are:

**Bee'm** "I will be"
**Bee oo** "You will be"
**Bee eh** "He will be"
**Bee ee** "She will be"
**Bee mayd** "We will be"
**Bee shiu** "You (pl) will be"
**Bee ad** "They will be"

#### Conditional

The conditional is formed using the particle **yinnagh** (negative **cha jinnagh**) followed by the subject and the verbal noun:

**Yinnagh mee goll** "I would go"
**Cha jinnagh mee goll** "I would not go"

For "to be," the conditional forms are:

**Veign** "I would be"
**Veagh oo** "You would be"
**Veagh eh** "He would be"
**Veagh ee** "She would be"
**Veagh shin** "We would be"
**Veagh shiu** "You (pl) would be"
**Veagh ad** "They would be"

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed using the bare stem of the verb:

**Gow!** "Go!"
**Tar!** "Come!"
**Abbyr!** "Say!"

### Prepositions

Manx has a system of inflected prepositions, where the preposition combines with a pronoun:

**ec** "at":
**aym** "at me"
**ayd** "at you"
**echey** "at him"
**eck** "at her"
**ain** "at us"
**eu** "at you (pl)"
**oc** "at them"

**dy** "to":
**dou** "to me"
**dhyt** "to you"
**da** "to him"
**jee** "to her"
**dooin** "to us"
**diu** "to you (pl)"
**daue** "to them"

## Syntax

### Word order

The basic word order in Manx is Verb-Subject-Object (VSO):

**Honnick yn dooinney yn vuc** "The man saw the pig"
(Lit. "Saw the man the pig")

In the present tense, using the verbal noun construction, the order becomes SVO:

**Ta'n dooinney fakin yn vuc** "The man sees the pig"
(Lit. "Is the man seeing the pig")

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by using the interrogative particle **vel** (present tense) or **row** (past tense):

**Vel oo goll?** "Are you going?"
**Row oo goll?** "Were you going?"

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns at the beginning of the sentence:

**Quoi t'ayns shen?** "Who is there?"
**C'raad t'ou goll?** "Where are you going?"

### Negation

Negation is formed using the particle **cha** (or **cha nel** in the present tense):

**Cha nel mee goll** "I am not going"
**Cha jagh mee** "I did not go"
**Cha jean mee goll** "I will not go"

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses in Manx are introduced by the particle **ta** (present/future) or **ren** (past):

**Yn dooinney ta goll** "The man who is going"
**Yn ven ren goll** "The woman who went"

### Copula

Manx uses two different verbs for "to be": **ta** (used for descriptions and states) and **she** (used for identification and classification):

**Ta mee skee** "I am tired" (state)
**She dooinney mie mee** "I am a good man" (identification)

## Vocabulary

Manx vocabulary is predominantly Celtic in origin, with many cognates in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. However, due to its unique history and contact with English, it also contains many loanwords and calques from English.

Some common Manx words and phrases:

**Traa dy liooar** "Time enough" (a common Manx expression meaning "There's plenty of time" or "No need to rush")

## Phonological processes

### Lenition

Lenition (or "soft mutation") is a common phonological process in Manx, as in other Celtic languages. It affects the initial consonant of words in certain grammatical contexts. Here's a more detailed look at lenition in Manx:

| Original | Lenited | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| b → v | **baatey** → **vaatey** | **my vaatey** "my boat" |
| c → ch | **cass** → **chass** | **e chass** "his foot" |
| ç → h | **çhengey** → **hengey** | **my hengey** "my tongue" |
| d → gh | **dooinney** → **ghooinney** | **y ghooinney** "the man" |
| f → - | **fer** → **er** | **yn er** "the man" |
| g → gh | **glioon** → **ghlioon** | **my ghlioon** "my knee" |
| j → y | **jough** → **yough** | **e yough** "his drink" |
| k → ch | **kione** → **chione** | **my chione** "my head" |
| m → v | **moddey** → **voddey** | **y voddey** "the dog" |
| p → ph | **paitçhey** → **phaitçhey** | **e phaitçhey** "his child" |
| q → wh | **quoi** → **whoi** | **y whoi** "to whom" |
| s → h | **sooill** → **hooill** | **my hooill** "my eye" |
| sh → h | **shengey** → **hengey** | **my hengey** "my tongue" |
| t → h | **thie** → **hie** | **my hie** "my house" |

Lenition occurs in various contexts, including:

1. After the definite article with feminine singular nouns:
   **yn ven** "the woman" (from **ben**)

2. After possessive pronouns:
   **my hie** "my house" (from **thie**)

3. In compound words:
   **ard-valley** "city" (lit. "high town", from **ard** "high" + **balley** "town")

4. After certain prepositions:
   **dy valle** "to a town" (from **balley**)

5. In the past tense of many verbs:
   **hie mee** "I went" (from **goll** "to go")

### Eclipsis

Eclipsis (or "nasalization") is another phonological process in Manx, although it's less prominent than in Irish. It mainly affects plural nouns after the definite article:

| Original | Eclipsed | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| b → m | **baljyn** → **maljyn** | **ny maljyn** "the towns" |
| c → g | **cabbil** → **gabbil** | **ny gabbil** "the horses" |
| d → n | **dorryssyn** → **norryssyn** | **ny norryssyn** "the doors" |
| f → v | **fir** → **vir** | **ny verin** "the men" |
| g → n | **glioonyn** → **nglioonyn** | **ny nglioonyn** "the knees" |
| j → n | **joughyn** → **njoughyn** | **ny njoughyn** "the drinks" |
| p → b | **paitçhyn** → **baitçhyn** | **ny baitçhyn** "the children" |
| t → d | **thieyn** → **dhieyn** | **ny dhieyn** "the houses" |

## Verbal system

The Manx verbal system is complex and differs significantly from English. Here's a more detailed look at some aspects:

### Aspect

Manx distinguishes between perfective and imperfective aspects, often using different verb forms:

Perfective (completed action):
**Ren mee screeu** "I wrote" (lit. "I did writing")

Imperfective (ongoing action):
**Va mee screeu** "I was writing"

### Periphrastic constructions

Manx often uses periphrastic constructions (using multiple words) where English might use a single verb:

**Ta mee er n'goll** "I have gone" (lit. "I am after going")
**Ta mee goll dy screeu** "I am going to write" (lit. "I am going to writing")

### Defective verbs

Some common Manx verbs are defective, meaning they lack certain forms. For example, the verb **shegin** "must" only exists in the present tense:

**Shegin dou goll** "I must go"
**V'eh dy beign goll** "I had to go" (using a different construction for the past)

### Verbal adjectives

Manx uses verbal adjectives (similar to past participles) in various constructions:

**Ta'n dorrys dooint** "The door is closed"
**T'eh goit** "It is taken"

### Impersonal forms

Manx has impersonal verb forms, similar to passive constructions in English:

**Haink-eh** "It was come" (meaning "Someone came")
**Hie-eh** "It was gone" (meaning "Someone went")

## Dialectal variation

Although Manx is now primarily a revived language, historical records show some dialectal variations, primarily between the north and south of the Isle of Man:

1. Pronunciation differences:
   Northern: **kione** [kʲoːn] "head"
   Southern: **kione** [kʲaun]

2. Vocabulary differences:
   Northern: **moddey** "dog"
   Southern: **coo** "dog"

3. Grammatical differences:
   Northern: **ta mee** "I am"
   Southern: **ta me** "I am"

However, modern revived Manx tends to be based on a standardized form that doesn't strictly adhere to these historical dialectal divisions.

## Writing system

The Manx writing system uses a modified version of the Latin alphabet. It doesn't use the letters j, k, q, v, x, or z in native Manx words, although some of these may appear in loanwords. The letter y is used as both a consonant and a vowel.

Manx orthography is based on English spelling conventions, which can make it look quite different from Irish or Scottish Gaelic. For example:

Manx: **çhengey**
Irish: **teanga**
Scottish Gaelic: **teanga**
(all meaning "tongue, language")

Some unique features of Manx orthography:

1. The use of ç for the sound [tʃ]
2. The digraph gh for the sound [ɣ] or [x]
3. The use of y for both the consonant [j] and the vowel [ɪ] or [ə]

## Loanwords and neologisms

As a revived language, Manx has had to adapt to the modern world. This has led to the creation of many neologisms and the borrowing of words from English and other languages:

**çhellveeish** "television" (from **çhell** "cell" + **feeish** "vision")
**eddyr-voggyl** "internet" (from **eddyr** "between" + **boggyl** "umbilical cord")
**coraid-lhome** "email" (from **coraid** "message" + **lhome** "bare, naked")

Some English loanwords have been adapted to Manx phonology and orthography:

**thunnag** "sweater" (from English "jumper")
**keirn** "tin can" (from English "can")

## Sample text

Here's a sample text in Manx with an English translation:

**Ta'n Ghaelg ny çhengey Celtiagh va loayrit ayns Ellan Vannin. Ga dy row ee er n'gholl magh ass ymmyd gys y veggan, t'ee er ve aa-vioghit as t'ee nish goll er gynsaghey as loayrt reesht. Ta'n çhengey feer ghoillee dy ynsaghey, agh t'ee feer aalin as t'ee feer scanshoil da cultoor as eiraght yn Ellan.**

Translation: "Manx is a Celtic language that was spoken in the Isle of Man. Although it had gone out of use to a small extent, it has been revived and is now being learned and spoken again. The language is very difficult to learn, but it is very beautiful and it is very important to the culture and heritage of the Island."

This text demonstrates several features of Manx, including:

- The use of the present tense with **ta**
- Lenition (e.g., **çhengey** → **ny çhengey**)
- Verbal nouns (e.g., **loayrit**, **gynsaghey**)
- Periphrastic past construction (**er n'gholl magh**)
- Adjectives following nouns (e.g., **çhengey Celtiagh**)
