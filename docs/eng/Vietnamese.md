# Vietnamese

Vietnamese is an Austroasiatic language spoken by about 95 million people, primarily in Vietnam. It is the official language of Vietnam and is also spoken by Vietnamese communities around the world. Vietnamese is a tonal language with a complex sound system and a relatively simple grammar structure.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Vietnamese uses a Latin-based alphabet with additional diacritical marks to indicate tones and certain vowel sounds. The pronunciation can be challenging for non-native speakers due to its tonal nature and some unfamiliar sounds.

### Vowels

| Letter | Northern Sound | Southern Sound |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
**a** | [a] | [a]
**ă** | [ă] (short 'a') | [ă] (short 'a')
**â** | [ə] (schwa) | [ə] (schwa)
**e** | [ɛ] | [ɛ]
**ê** | [e] | [e]
**i**, **y** | [i] | [i]
**o** | [ɔ] | [ɔ]
**ô** | [o] | [o]
**ơ** | [ɤ] | [ɤ]
**u** | [u] | [u]
**ư** | [ɯ] | [ɯ]

### Consonants

| Letter | Northern Sound | Southern Sound |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
**b** | [ɓ] (implosive b) | [ɓ] (implosive b)
**c**, **k** | [k] | [k]
**ch** | [tɕ] | [c]
**d** | [z] | [j]
**đ** | [ɗ] (implosive d) | [ɗ] (implosive d)
**g**, **gh** | [ɣ] | [ɣ]
**gi** | [z] | [j]
**h** | [h] | [h]
**kh** | [x] | [x]
**l** | [l] | [l]
**m** | [m] | [m]
**n** | [n] | [n]
**ng**, **ngh** | [ŋ] | [ŋ]
**nh** | [ɲ] | [ɲ]
**p** | [p] | [p]
**ph** | [f] | [f]
**qu** | [kw] | [w]
**r** | [z] | [ɾ]
**s** | [s] | [ʂ]
**t** | [t] | [t]
**th** | [tʰ] | [tʰ]
**tr** | [tɕ] | [ʈ]
**v** | [v] | [v]
**x** | [s] | [s]

### Tones

Vietnamese has six tones, represented by diacritical marks above or below the vowel:

| Tone | Mark | Example | Northern Pitch | Southern Pitch |
|------|------|---------|----------------|----------------|
Level (ngang) | No mark | ma | mid-level | mid-level
Falling (huyền) | ` | mà | low falling | low falling
Rising (sắc) | ´ | má | high rising | high rising
Dipping-rising (hỏi) | ̉ | mả | mid falling-rising | low falling
Breaking-rising (ngã) | ˜ | mã | high falling-rising (with glottal stop) | high rising
Heavy (nặng) | . | mạ | low falling (with glottal stop) | low falling (with glottal stop)

In the Southern dialect, the hỏi and ngã tones are often merged, resulting in a five-tone system.

### Syllable structure

Vietnamese syllables typically follow this structure: (C)(w)V(C), where:
- (C) is an optional initial consonant
- (w) is an optional medial [w] sound
- V is a required vowel or diphthong
- (C) is an optional final consonant

Examples:
- **ba** [ɓa] ('three')
- **quê** [kwe] ('hometown')
- **không** [xoŋm] ('no')

### Stress

Vietnamese words are generally monosyllabic, so stress is not a significant feature. In compound words, stress is typically even across syllables.

## Morphology

Vietnamese is an analytic language, meaning it relies more on word order and particles rather than inflection to convey grammatical information.

### Nouns

Nouns in Vietnamese do not change form for number, gender, or case. Plurals are indicated by context or by adding number words or classifiers.

Examples:
- **con mèo** ('cat')
- **hai con mèo** ('two cats')
- **những con mèo** ('the cats')

### Classifiers

Classifiers are words used before nouns to categorize them. They are required when using numbers or demonstratives with nouns. Some common classifiers include:

| Classifier | Used for |
|------------|----------|
**con** | animals, some objects
**cái** | inanimate objects
**người** | people
**cây** | long, thin objects (trees, pens)
**quả** | roundish objects (fruits)
**cuốn** | books, notebooks

Examples:
- **hai con chó** ('two dogs')
- **ba cái bàn** ('three tables')
- **năm người bạn** ('five friends')

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Vietnamese can be complex, as they often reflect social relationships and levels of formality. Here are some common pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
1st | tôi, tao (informal) | chúng tôi, chúng ta (inclusive)
2nd | bạn, mày (informal) | các bạn, chúng mày (informal)
3rd | nó (informal), anh ấy (he), cô ấy (she) | họ, chúng nó (informal)

In addition to these, kinship terms are often used as pronouns, such as:
- **anh** (older brother/man)
- **chị** (older sister/woman)
- **em** (younger sibling)
- **bác** (uncle/aunt, older than parents)
- **cô** (aunt, father's younger sister)
- **chú** (uncle, father's younger brother)

### Numbers

Vietnamese numbers follow a decimal system. Basic numbers include:

| Number | Vietnamese |
|--------|------------|
0 | không
1 | một
2 | hai
3 | ba
4 | bốn
5 | năm
6 | sáu
7 | bảy
8 | tám
9 | chín
10 | mười

Numbers from 11 to 19 are formed by adding "mười" (ten) before the digit:
- 11: mười một
- 15: mười lăm (note: năm becomes lăm)

Multiples of ten use "mươi":
- 20: hai mươi
- 50: năm mươi

Large numbers:
- 100: một trăm
- 1,000: một nghìn
- 1,000,000: một triệu

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Vietnamese do not change form. They typically follow the noun they modify:

- **cái bàn lớn** ('big table', literally 'table big')
- **con mèo đen** ('black cat', literally 'cat black')

Some adjectives can also function as stative verbs:
- **Tôi mệt.** ('I am tired.')

### Verbs

Vietnamese verbs do not conjugate for tense, person, or number. Tense and aspect are indicated by context or by using time words and particles.

Present tense is usually unmarked:
- **Tôi ăn cơm.** ('I eat rice.' or 'I am eating rice.')

Past tense can be indicated with "đã":
- **Tôi đã ăn cơm.** ('I ate rice.' or 'I have eaten rice.')

Future tense can be indicated with "sẽ":
- **Tôi sẽ ăn cơm.** ('I will eat rice.')

Continuous aspect can be shown with "đang":
- **Tôi đang ăn cơm.** ('I am eating rice.')

Completed action can be indicated with "xong" or "rồi":
- **Tôi ăn xong rồi.** ('I have finished eating.')

Negation is formed by placing "không" before the verb:
- **Tôi không ăn cơm.** ('I don't eat rice.' or 'I am not eating rice.')

### Adverbs

Adverbs typically precede the verb or adjective they modify:
- **Tôi chậm ăn.** ('I eat slowly.')
- **Cô ấy rất đẹp.** ('She is very beautiful.')

### Comparatives and Superlatives

Comparatives are formed using "hơn" (more) after the adjective:
- **Anh ấy cao hơn tôi.** ('He is taller than me.')

Superlatives use "nhất" (most) after the adjective:
- **Cô ấy đẹp nhất.** ('She is the most beautiful.')

## Syntax

Vietnamese follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order:
- **Tôi ăn cơm.** ('I eat rice.')

### Questions

Yes/no questions can be formed by adding the particle "không" at the end of a statement:
- **Bạn ăn cơm không?** ('Do you eat rice?')

Alternative questions use "hay" (or) between options:
- **Bạn uống cà phê hay trà?** ('Do you drink coffee or tea?')

Wh-questions use question words, which typically appear in the same position as the answer would:
- **Bạn ăn gì?** ('What do you eat?')
- **Ai đến?** ('Who came?')
- **Bạn đi đâu?** ('Where are you going?')

Common question words:
- **ai** (who)
- **gì** (what)
- **nào** (which)
- **ở đâu** (where)
- **khi nào** (when)
- **tại sao**, **vì sao** (why)
- **bao nhiêu** (how many/much)

### Sentence particles

Vietnamese uses several sentence-final particles to express mood or attitude:

- **nhé**: suggestion or seeking agreement
  **Chúng ta đi ăn nhé.** ('Let's go eat, shall we?')

- **à**: mild surprise or realization
  **Bạn đến rồi à?** ('Oh, you've arrived?')

- **đấy/đó**: emphasis or mild warning
  **Cẩn thận đấy.** ('Be careful, you hear?')

- **nhỉ**: seeking confirmation or agreement
  **Hôm nay trời đẹp nhỉ?** ('The weather is nice today, isn't it?')

### Serial verb constructions

Vietnamese often uses serial verb constructions, where two or more verbs are used in sequence without conjunctions:
- **Tôi đi mua sắm.** ('I go shopping.' Literally: 'I go buy things.')
- **Cô ấy về nhà nấu cơm.** ('She goes home to cook rice.' Literally: 'She return home cook rice.')

### Topic-comment structure

While SVO is the basic word order, Vietnamese also frequently uses topic-comment structures, where the topic of the sentence is placed at the beginning:
- **Quyển sách đó, tôi đã đọc rồi.** ('That book, I have already read it.')

### Passive voice

Passive constructions are less common in Vietnamese than in English. When used, they are often formed with "được" (to receive, can) or "bị" (to suffer):
- **Cái cửa được mở.** ('The door is opened.')
- **Anh ấy bị đuổi việc.** ('He was fired.' Literally: 'He suffered job dismissal.')

### Relative clauses

Vietnamese relative clauses follow the noun they modify and are introduced by the particle "mà":
- **Người mà tôi gặp hôm qua là bạn tôi.** ('The person whom I met yesterday is my friend.')

For possessive relationships, "của" is used:
- **Người mà tôi mượn sách của anh ấy là bạn tôi.** ('The person whose book I borrowed is my friend.')

### Conditional sentences

Conditional sentences in Vietnamese often use "nếu" (if) to introduce the condition:
- **Nếu trời mưa, tôi sẽ ở nhà.** ('If it rains, I will stay at home.')

The consequence can also be introduced by "thì":
- **Nếu trời mưa thì tôi sẽ ở nhà.** ('If it rains, then I will stay at home.')

### Complement clauses

Complement clauses often follow the main clause without a conjunction:
- **Tôi nghĩ anh ấy sẽ đến.** ('I think he will come.')

Some verbs require the complementizer "rằng" or "là":
- **Cô ấy nói rằng sẽ đến muộn.** ('She said that she will be late.')

### Imperative constructions

Imperatives can be formed simply by using the bare verb:
- **Đi!** ('Go!')

For more polite requests, "hãy" or "xin" can be used before the verb:
- **Hãy đợi tôi.** ('Please wait for me.')
- **Xin vui lòng ngồi xuống.** ('Please sit down.')

### Existential constructions

Existential sentences often use "có" (to have):
- **Có một con mèo trong vườn.** ('There is a cat in the garden.')

Negative existentials use "không có":
- **Không có ai ở nhà.** ('There is nobody at home.')

### Copular constructions

Vietnamese doesn't have a true copula (like "to be" in English). For equational sentences, the nouns or noun phrases are simply juxtaposed:
- **Anh ấy bác sĩ.** ('He [is] a doctor.')

For adjectival predicates, the adjective directly follows the subject:
- **Hoa đẹp.** ('The flower [is] beautiful.')

### Causative constructions

Causatives can be formed using verbs like "làm" (to make) or "khiến" (to cause):
- **Cô ấy làm tôi cười.** ('She made me laugh.')
- **Tiếng ồn khiến tôi không ngủ được.** ('The noise caused me to not be able to sleep.')

### Comparative constructions

Comparatives use "hơn" after the adjective:
- **Anh ấy cao hơn tôi.** ('He is taller than me.')

For equality, "bằng" is used:
- **Cô ấy xinh bằng chị ấy.** ('She is as pretty as her older sister.')

### Resultative constructions

Resultative constructions often use serial verb constructions:
- **Tôi ăn no rồi.** ('I ate [and became] full.')
- **Cô ấy khóc đỏ mắt.** ('She cried [until her] eyes [became] red.')

These syntactic constructions demonstrate the analytical nature of Vietnamese, where grammatical relationships are expressed through word order and particles rather than inflection. The differences between Northern and Southern dialects are primarily phonological, with some vocabulary variations, but the basic syntacticCertainly, I'll continue with more details on Vietnamese syntax and pronunciation differences between Northern and Southern dialects:

### Syntactic Variations between Northern and Southern Dialects

While the core syntax remains the same, there are some notable differences between Northern and Southern Vietnamese:

1. Use of "để" vs. "đặng":
   Northern: **Tôi học để nói tiếng Việt.** ('I study to speak Vietnamese.')
   Southern: **Tôi học đặng nói tiếng Việt.**

2. Placement of "rồi" (already):
   Northern: **Tôi ăn cơm rồi.** ('I have already eaten rice.')
   Southern: **Tôi ăn cơm rồi.** or **Tôi đã ăn cơm rồi.**

3. Use of final particles:
   Northern: **đấy** (emphasis)
   Southern: **đó** (emphasis)

4. Intensifiers:
   Northern: **rất** (very)
   Southern: **quá** (placed after the adjective)
   Example: 
   Northern: **rất đẹp** ('very beautiful')
   Southern: **đẹp quá**

### Additional Pronunciation Differences

1. Final consonants:
   - In the North, final /-t/ and /-k/ are unreleased [t̚] and [k̚].
   - In the South, these are often released as [t] and [k].

2. Initial consonants:
   - The Northern [z] (for 'd' and 'gi') becomes [j] in the South.
   - The Northern [ʂ] (for 'tr') becomes [ʈ] in the South.

3. Vowel differences:
   - The Northern [ɔ] (for 'o') is often pronounced as [ɔ̞] in the South.
   - The Northern [ɤ] (for 'ơ') is often pronounced as [ɤ̞] in the South.

4. Tone differences:
   - The hỏi tone (mid falling-rising in the North) is often pronounced as a low falling tone in the South.
   - The ngã tone (high falling-rising with glottal stop in the North) is often merged with the sắc tone (high rising) in the South.

### Complex Sentence Structures

1. Subordinate clauses:
Vietnamese uses various conjunctions to introduce subordinate clauses:

- Temporal: **khi** (when), **trước khi** (before), **sau khi** (after)
  **Khi tôi đến, anh ấy đã đi.** ('When I arrived, he had already left.')

- Causal: **vì** (because), **do** (due to)
  **Tôi không đi vì trời mưa.** ('I didn't go because it was raining.')

- Concessive: **mặc dù** (although), **dù** (even though)
  **Mặc dù trời mưa, chúng tôi vẫn đi chơi.** ('Although it was raining, we still went out.')

- Purpose: **để** (in order to)
  **Tôi học tiếng Việt để nói chuyện với bạn.** ('I study Vietnamese in order to talk with friends.')

2. Coordinating conjunctions:
- **và** (and), **hoặc** (or), **nhưng** (but), **vì vậy** (therefore)
  **Tôi thích cà phê và trà.** ('I like coffee and tea.')

3. Correlative conjunctions:
- **không những... mà còn** (not only... but also)
  **Không những anh ấy thông minh mà còn chăm chỉ.** ('He is not only intelligent but also hardworking.')

### Clause Chaining

Vietnamese often uses clause chaining, where multiple clauses are linked together without explicit conjunctions:

**Tôi về nhà, tắm rửa, nấu cơm, xem tivi.** 
('I went home, took a bath, cooked rice, watched TV.')

### Topic Prominence

Vietnamese is a topic-prominent language, meaning that the topic of a sentence is often explicitly marked and can be different from the grammatical subject:

**Về chuyện đó thì tôi không biết gì cả.** 
('As for that matter, I don't know anything at all.')

### Double Subject Constructions

Vietnamese allows for double subject constructions, where two noun phrases appear at the beginning of a sentence:

**Con mèo đó đuôi nó dài.** 
(Literally: 'That cat its tail is long.' Meaning: 'That cat has a long tail.')

### Verb Serialization for Aspect and Direction

Verb serialization is used to express aspectual and directional information:

- Directional: **đi vào** (go in), **chạy ra** (run out)
  **Cô ấy đi vào nhà.** ('She went into the house.')

- Aspectual: **ăn xong** (eat finish), **nói lại** (say again)
  **Tôi ăn xong rồi.** ('I have finished eating.')

### Reduplication

Reduplication is a common feature in Vietnamese, used for intensification, plurality, or to change word class:

- Full reduplication: **xanh xanh** ('greenish', from **xanh** 'green')
- Partial reduplication: **lúp xúp** ('bobbing up and down', from **xúp** 'to bob')

### Numerical Expressions

Complex numerical expressions follow a specific structure:

**hai trăm ba mươi lăm nghìn bốn trăm năm mươi sáu**
(235,456 - two hundred thirty-five thousand four hundred fifty-six)

### Classifiers in Complex Noun Phrases

When using multiple adjectives with a classified noun, the classifier is typically repeated:

**hai con mèo đen con mèo lớn**
('two big black cats', literally: 'two classifier cat black classifier cat big')

### Pragmatic Particles

Vietnamese uses a variety of particles to express the speaker's attitude or to manage discourse:

- **mà**: contradiction or emphasis
  **Tôi mà biết thì đã nói rồi.** ('If I had known, I would have said so.')

- **chứ**: emphasis or rhetorical question
  **Anh đi chứ?** ('You're going, aren't you?')

- **kìa**: drawing attention
  **Nhìn kìa!** ('Look there!')

### Honorific Language

Vietnamese uses an elaborate system of honorifics, reflected in pronoun choice and certain vocabulary items:

- **xin**: polite marker for requests
  **Xin lỗi** ('Excuse me', literally: 'Please forgive')

- **dạ**: polite affirmative
  **Dạ, tôi hiểu.** ('Yes, I understand.')

### Omission of Subjects and Objects

Vietnamese often omits subjects and objects when they can be inferred from context:

A: **Anh đã ăn cơm chưa?** ('Have you eaten rice yet?')
B: **Ăn rồi.** ('(I) have eaten (rice) already.')

These additional syntactic features and dialectal differences showcase the complexity and flexibility of the Vietnamese language. The interplay between word order, particles, and context allows for nuanced expression and reflects the cultural values embedded in the language.
