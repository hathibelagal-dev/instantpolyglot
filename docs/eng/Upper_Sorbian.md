Questions can be formed by changing the intonation or using question words:

Negation is formed by adding **nje-** to the verb:

**Nan nječita knihu.** (The father doesn’t read a book.)

Subordinate clauses often use the conjunction **zo** (that):

**Wěm, zo nan knihu čita.** (I know that the father reads a book.)

Relative clauses use relative pronouns such as **kotryž** (which, who):

**To je kniha, kotruž nan čita.** (This is the book which the father reads.)

### Case usage

The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence:

**Holca spi.** (The girl sleeps.)

The accusative case is used for the direct object:

**Widźu holcu.** (I see the girl.)

The genitive case is used to show possession or after certain prepositions:

**kniha mojeho bratra** (my brother's book)
**bjez wody** (without water)

The dative case is used for indirect objects or after certain prepositions:

The vocative case is used for direct address:
