# Romance Languages

The Romance languages are a group of closely related languages that evolved from Vulgar Latin, the spoken form of Latin used in the Roman Empire. They are part of the Indo-European language family and are spoken by over 800 million people worldwide as first or second languages.

## Origins and History

The Romance languages began to diverge from Vulgar Latin after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century CE. As the Roman Empire's political and cultural influence waned, regional varieties of Vulgar Latin evolved independently, influenced by local substrates and adstrates.

The main Romance languages include:

1. Spanish (Castilian)
2. Portuguese
3. French
4. Italian
5. Romanian
6. Catalan

Other significant Romance languages and dialects include:

- Galician
- Occitan
- Sardinian
- Corsican
- Sicilian
- Venetian
- Aromanian
- Romansh

## Common Features

While each Romance language has its unique characteristics, they share many common features inherited from their Latin roots:

### Phonology

1. Vowel systems: Most Romance languages have 5-7 vowel phonemes.
   Examples:
   - Spanish: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/
   - French: /a/, /e/, /ɛ/, /i/, /o/, /ɔ/, /u/, /y/, /ə/
   - Italian: /a/, /e/, /ɛ/, /i/, /o/, /ɔ/, /u/

2. Consonant clusters: Generally simpler than in Latin, with many clusters simplified or eliminated.
   Examples:
   - Latin "noctem" (night) → Spanish "noche", Italian "notte", French "nuit"
   - Latin "factum" (fact) → Spanish "hecho", Italian "fatto", French "fait"

3. Stress: Usually predictable, often on the penultimate syllable.
   Examples:
   - Spanish: ca-SA, li-BRO, es-TU-dian-te
   - Italian: CA-sa, li-BRO, stu-DEN-te

4. Palatalization: Common process affecting velar and dental consonants before front vowels.
   Examples:
   - Latin "centum" (hundred) → Italian "cento" /ˈtʃɛnto/, French "cent" /sɑ̃/, Spanish "ciento" /ˈθjento/

   - Latin 'facere' → Italian 'fare', French 'faire', Spanish 'hacer' (to do)

3. Lenition of intervocalic consonants
   - Latin 'vita' → Spanish 'vida', Portuguese 'vida', French 'vie' (life)
   - Latin 'focus' → Spanish 'fuego', Italian 'fuoco', French 'feu' (fire)

4. Diphthongization of stressed vowels in open syllables (in some languages)
   - Latin 'petra' → Spanish 'piedra', Italian 'pietra', French 'pierre' (stone)
   - Latin 'bonus' → Spanish 'bueno', Italian 'buono', French 'bon' (good)

5. Development of nasal vowels (especially in French and Portuguese)

   - Latin 'centum' → French 'cent' [sɑ̃], Portuguese 'cem' [sẽ] (hundred)

6. Loss of unstressed vowels in some languages
   - Latin 'oculus' → French 'œil', Portuguese 'olho' (eye)
   - Latin 'viridis' → French 'vert', Italian 'verde' (green)

## Lexical Developments

While Romance languages share a large common vocabulary from Latin, they have also developed unique words and borrowed from various sources:

1. Retentions from Latin:
   - Latin 'aqua' → Italian 'acqua', Spanish 'agua', Portuguese 'água', French 'eau' (water)

     Portuguese 'açúcar' (sugar), 'azeitona' (olive)
   - Germanic: 
     French 'guerre' (war), 'blanc' (white)
     Italian 'guardare' (to look), 'bianco' (white)
   - Slavic: 
     Romanian 'iubi' (to love), 'drag' (dear)

   - Increased reliance on word order and prepositions to indicate grammatical relationships
   Example:
   Latin: "Marcus Juliae librum dat" (Marcus gives Julia a book)
   Italian: "Marco dà un libro a Giulia"
   Spanish: "Marco da un libro a Julia"

   Example:
   Latin: "amatur" (he is loved)
   Italian: "è amato"
   Spanish: "es amado"
   French: "est aimé"

4. Periphrastic future and conditional tenses
   - Classical Latin synthetic future replaced by analytic forms derived from infinitive + 'have'
   Example (future of 'to sing'):
   Latin: "cantabo" (I will sing)
   Italian: "canterò" (from cantare + ho)
   Spanish: "cantaré" (from cantar + he)
   French: "chanterai" (from chanter + ai)

5. Development of clitic pronoun systems
   - Pronouns in many Romance languages can attach to verbs as clitics
   Example:
   Italian: "Dammelo" (Give it to me)
   Spanish: "Dámelo" (Give it to me)
   French: "Donne-le-moi" (Give it to me)

6. Use of subjunctive mood
   - While Latin used the subjunctive extensively, its use in Romance languages varies
   Example (I want you to come):
   Italian: "Voglio che tu venga"
   Spanish: "Quiero que vengas"
   French: "Je veux que tu viennes"

7. Question formation
   - Inversion or use of interrogative particles
   Example:
   French: "Parlez-vous français?" or "Est-ce que vous parlez français?"
   Spanish: "¿Hablas español?"
   Italian: "Parli italiano?"

## Dialectal Variation

Romance languages exhibit significant dialectal variation, often forming dialect continua:

1. Iberian Peninsula:
   - Galician-Portuguese continuum
     Example: Galician "home" vs. Portuguese "homem" (man)
   - Catalan-Occitan continuum
     Example: Catalan "aigua" vs. Occitan "aiga" (water)

2. Italy:
   - Northern Italian dialects (Gallo-Italic)
     Example: Piedmontese "ca" vs. Standard Italian "casa" (house)
   - Central Italian dialects (including Tuscan, the basis of standard Italian)
     Example: Tuscan "figliolo" vs. Standard Italian "figlio" (son)
   - Southern Italian dialects
     Example: Neapolitan "guaglione" vs. Standard Italian "ragazzo" (boy)

3. France:
   - Langues d'oïl in the north (including standard French)
     Example: Picard "pu" vs. Standard French "plus" (more)
   - Occitan (Langue d'oc) in the south
     Example: Occitan "filha" vs. French "fille" (daughter)

4. Eastern Romance:
   - Daco-Romanian (standard Romanian)
   - Aromanian
   - Megleno-Romanian
   - Istro-Romanian
   Example: Romanian "apă" vs. Aromanian "apã" (water)

## Classification

Romance languages are typically classified into several subgroups:

1. Italo-Western Romance:
   a. Western Romance:
      - Ibero-Romance (Spanish, Portuguese, Galician)
      - Occitano-Romance (Occitan, Catalan)
      - Gallo-Romance (French, Franco-Provençal)
      - Rhaeto-Romance (Romansh, Ladin, Friulian)
   b. Italo-Dalmatian:
      - Italian
      - Sicilian
      - Corsican
      - Sardinian (sometimes considered a separate branch)

2. Eastern Romance:
   - Romanian
   - Aromanian
   - Megleno-Romanian
   - Istro-Romanian

This classification is somewhat simplified, and there is ongoing debate about the exact relationships between some languages and dialects.

## Writing Systems

Most Romance languages use the Latin alphabet, with various diacritical marks to represent sounds not found in Latin:

- Spanish: ñ, á, é, í, ó, ú, ü
  Example: año (year), café (coffee)
- French: é, è, ê, à, â, ô, ï, ü, ç
  Example: été (summer), français (French)
- Portuguese: á, â, ã, à, é, ê, í, ó, ô, õ, ú, ç
  Example: maçã (apple), coração (heart)
- Italian: à, è, é, ì, ò, ó, ù
  Example: città (city), perché (why)
- Romanian: ă, â, î, ș, ț
  Example: România (Romania), știință (science)

Some languages have undergone spelling reforms:

- Portuguese: 1990 Orthographic Agreement aimed at unifying Brazilian and European orthographies
  Example: Before: acção (action), After: ação
- French: Various reforms, most recently in 1990
  Example: Before: oignon (onion), After: ognon (both spellings accepted)

## Influence on Other Languages

Romance languages have significantly influenced many non-Romance languages:

1. English: Extensive French influence due to the Norman Conquest, later Italian and Spanish influences
   Examples: beef (from French bœuf), piano (from Italian), siesta (from Spanish)

2. Basque: Despite being a language isolate, has borrowed heavily from neighboring Romance languages
   Examples: denbora (time, from Latin tempora), eliza (church, from Latin ecclesia)

3. Maltese: An Afroasiatic language with significant Romance (mainly Italian and Sicilian) influence
   Examples: skola (school), festi (feast)

4. Albanian: Has borrowed extensively from Latin and later Romance languages
   Examples: qytet (city, from Latin civitas), shkollë (school, from Latin schola)

5. Germanic languages: Especially those bordering Romance-speaking areas (e.g., German, Dutch)
   Examples: German Fenster (window, from Latin fenestra), Dutch kaas (cheese, from Latin caseus)

## Creole Languages

Many creole languages are based on Romance languages, particularly French, Portuguese, and Spanish. Examples include:

- Haitian Creole (French-based)
  Example: "Mwen renmen ou" (I love you) - compare with French "Je t'aime"

- Papiamentu (Spanish and Portuguese-based)
  Example: "Mi ta papia Papiamentu" (I speak Papiamentu) - compare with Spanish "Yo hablo Papiamento"

- Cape Verdean Creole (Portuguese-based)
  Example: "N ta papia Kriolu" (I speak Creole) - compare with Portuguese "Eu falo Crioulo"

- Chavacano (Spanish-based, spoken in the Philippines)
  Example: "Ta komé yo" (I am eating) - compare with Spanish "Estoy comiendo"

These creole languages demonstrate how Romance languages have spread globally and evolved in contact with other languages, creating new linguistic systems that retain elements of their Romance origins while developing unique features.
