# Indigenous Languages Of South America

South America is home to a rich tapestry of indigenous languages, representing hundreds of distinct tongues across numerous language families and isolates. This linguistic diversity reflects the complex history and cultural richness of the continent's indigenous peoples. From the Andes to the Amazon, these languages exhibit a wide array of phonological, morphological, and syntactic features that have fascinated linguists for generations.

## Major Language Families

### Arawakan

The Arawakan family is one of the most geographically widespread in South America, with languages spoken from the Caribbean to Brazil and Bolivia.

#### Phonology

Arawakan languages typically have relatively simple phoneme inventories. Many languages in this family have a system of 4-6 vowels and around 15-20 consonants. Nasalization is often a significant feature.

Example from Terena:

Consonants:
| Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| p | t |  | k | ʔ |
| m | n |  |  |  |
|  | s |  |  | h |
|  | ɾ |  |  |  |
| w |  | j |  |  |

Vowels: /a e i o u/

Some Arawakan languages, like Garifuna, have more complex systems. Garifuna has both oral and nasal vowels:

Oral vowels: /a e i o u/
Nasal vowels: /ã ẽ ĩ õ ũ/

#### Morphology

Arawakan languages are known for their complex verbal morphology, often incorporating person, number, tense, aspect, and mood. Many languages in this family use prefixes for person marking and suffixes for other grammatical categories.

Example from Tariana:

**nu-ñhapa-ka**
1SG-arrive-REC.PAST.VIS
"I arrived (I saw it happen)"

**pi-ñhapa-mahka**
2SG-arrive-REC.PAST.NONVIS
"You arrived (I didn't see it happen)"

**wa-ñhapa-mhade**
1PL-arrive-FUT
"We will arrive"

In this example, we see person prefixes (nu-, pi-, wa-), the verb root -ñhapa- "arrive", and tense/evidentiality suffixes (-ka, -mahka, -mhade).

Many Arawakan languages also have a system of classifier suffixes that categorize nouns based on their physical or functional properties.

Example from Baniwa:

**aapi-da**
fruit-CL:ROUND
"round fruit"

**aapi-hi**
fruit-CL:LONG
"long fruit"

#### Syntax

Many Arawakan languages have a basic SVO word order, though this can vary. They often use postpositions rather than prepositions.

Example from Terena:

**Ûti nikoa xâne**
man eat fish
"The man eats fish"

**Ina ovoku xâne**
in house man
"The man is in the house"

In the second example, we see the postposition **ina** "in" following the noun it governs.

### Tupian

The Tupian family includes languages spoken across Brazil and neighboring countries, with Tupi-Guarani being its largest and most well-known branch.

#### Phonology

Tupian languages often have nasal vowels and a distinction between oral and nasal consonants. Many languages in this family also have a series of prenasalized consonants.

Example from Guarani:

Consonants:
| Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| p | t |  | k | ʔ |
| m̥ m | n̥ n | ɲ̊ ɲ | ŋ̊ ŋ |  |
| ᵐb | ⁿd |  | ᵑɡ |  |
|  | s |  |  | h |
|  | ɾ |  |  |  |
| w |  | j |  |  |

Vowels: /a e i o u ã ẽ ĩ õ ũ/

In this system, we see the contrast between voiceless nasals (m̥, n̥, etc.), voiced nasals (m, n, etc.), and prenasalized stops (ᵐb, ⁿd, etc.).

#### Morphology

Tupian languages are typically agglutinative, with complex verb morphology. They often use prefixes for person marking and suffixes for tense, aspect, and mood.

Example from Guarani:

**a-guata**
1SG-walk
"I walk"

**re-guata**
2SG-walk
"You walk"

**o-guata**
3-walk
"He/she walks"

**ro-guata**
1PL.EXCL-walk
"We (excluding you) walk"

**ja-guata**
1PL.INCL-walk
"We (including you) walk"

**pe-guata**
2PL-walk
"You (plural) walk"

This example demonstrates the person prefixes in Guarani, including the distinction between inclusive and exclusive first person plural.

Tupian languages often have a rich system of valency-changing morphology:

**a-mbo-guata**
1SG-CAUS-walk
"I make (someone) walk"

**a-je-guata**
1SG-REFL-walk
"I walk myself"

#### Syntax

Many Tupian languages have a basic SOV word order, though this can be flexible. They typically use postpositions.

Example from Guarani:

**Che jagua-pe a-hecha**
I dog-ACC 1SG-see
"I see the dog"

**Oga-pe a-ha**
house-to 1SG-go
"I go to the house"

Tupian languages often have a system of switch-reference marking, indicating whether the subject of a dependent clause is the same as or different from the subject of the main clause.

Example from Kamaiurá:

**a-jot a-maraka-m**
1SG-come 1SG-sing-GER
"I came to sing" (same subject)

**a-jot i-maraka-ramẽ**
1SG-come 3-sing-SUB
"I came when he sang" (different subject)

### Quechuan

The Quechuan family includes languages spoken in the Andean region, with Quechua being the most widely spoken indigenous language in South America.

#### Phonology

Quechuan languages typically have a three-vowel system /a i u/ and distinguish between plain, aspirated, and ejective consonants. This three-way contrast is a areal feature of the Andes.

Example from Cusco Quechua:

Consonants:
| Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| p pʰ p' | t tʰ t' |  | k kʰ k' | q qʰ q' |  |
| m | n | ɲ |  |  |  |
|  | s | ʃ |  |  | h |
|  | l | ʎ |  |  |  |
|  | ɾ |  |  |  |  |
| w |  | j |  |  |  |

Vowels: /a i u/

In this system, we see the three-way contrast between plain (p, t, etc.), aspirated (pʰ, tʰ, etc.), and ejective (p', t', etc.) consonants.

#### Morphology

Quechuan languages are highly agglutinative, with a rich system of suffixes for various grammatical functions. They use both derivational and inflectional morphology extensively.

Example from Cusco Quechua:

**Riku-wa-nki-chu**
see-1OBJ-2SG-Q
"Do you see me?"

**Riku-chi-wa-nki-man-chu**
see-CAUS-1OBJ-2SG-COND-Q
"Would you show me?"

In these examples, we see object marking (-wa-), subject marking (-nki-), causative (-chi-), conditional (-man-), and question (-chu) suffixes.

Quechuan languages also have a system of evidential suffixes, marking the source of information:

**Para-sha-n**
rain-PROG-3SG
"It is raining" (Direct evidence, the speaker sees it raining)

**Para-sha-sqa**
rain-PROG-REP
"It was raining" (Reported evidence, someone told the speaker)

**Para-sha-n-man**
rain-PROG-3SG-COND
"It might be raining" (Inferential evidence, based on clouds, for example)

#### Syntax

Quechuan languages typically have an SOV word order and use postpositions. They also have an evidential system, marking the source of information in statements.

Example from Cusco Quechua:

**Runakuna llaqtata ri-sqa-nku**
people town-ACC go-PST.REP-3PL
"The people went to town (I was told)"

**Ñuqa wasi-man ri-saq**
I house-to go-FUT.1SG
"I will go to the house"

Quechuan languages use nominalized clauses extensively in complex sentences:

**Miku-na-yki-ta muna-ni**
eat-NMLZ-2POSS-ACC want-1SG
"I want you to eat" (literally: "I want your eating")

### Aymaran

The Aymaran family includes Aymara and its close relatives, spoken primarily in Bolivia, Peru, and Chile.

#### Phonology

Aymaran languages have a similar phonological system to Quechuan languages, with three vowels and a distinction between plain, aspirated, and ejective consonants.

Example from Aymara:

Consonants:
| Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| p p' pʰ | t t' tʰ |  | k k' kʰ | q q' qʰ |  |
| m | n | ɲ |  |  |  |
|  | s | ʃ | x | χ | h |
|  | l | ʎ |  |  |  |
|  | ɾ |  |  |  |  |
| w |  | j |  |  |  |

Vowels: /a i u/

#### Morphology

Aymaran languages are agglutinative, with a complex system of suffixes. They use both nominal and verbal suffixes to express various grammatical categories.

Example from Aymara:

**Uta-ja-ru**
house-1POSS-to
"To my house"

**Sar-ta**
go-1SG
"I go"

**Sar-iri-:ta-wa**
go-HAB-1SG-AFFIRM
"I usually go"

In the last example, we see habitual aspect (-iri-), first person singular (-:ta-), and an affirmative marker (-wa).

Aymara also has a complex system of data source marking, similar to but distinct from Quechua:

**Jupa-x sar-i**
he-TOP go-3SG
"He goes" (Direct knowledge)

**Jupa-x sar-tayna**
he-TOP go-3SG.PST.NONFIRSTHAND
"He went" (Non-firsthand information)

#### Syntax

Aymaran languages typically have an SOV word order and use postpositions. They also have a topic-comment structure, marked by the suffix -xa (often written as -x).

Example from Aymara:

**Jupa-x uta-pa-ru sar-i**
he-TOP house-3POSS-to go-3SG
"He goes to his house"

**Naya-x aka uta-n-k-t-wa**
I-TOP this house-in-be-1SG-AFFIRM
"I am in this house"

Like Quechua, Aymara makes extensive use of nominalized clauses:

**Jupa-n jut-iri-pa-x wali-wa**
he-GEN come-NMLZ-3POSS-TOP good-AFFIRM
"That he comes is good" (literally: "His coming is good")

### Cariban

The Cariban family includes languages spoken primarily in northern South America, particularly in Venezuela, Guyana, and northern Brazil.

#### Phonology

Cariban languages often have relatively small phoneme inventories. Many languages in this family have a series of palatalized consonants.

Example from Hixkaryana:

Consonants:
| Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| p | t | tʃ | k |
| m | n | ɲ |  |
|  | s |  |  |
|  | ɾ |  |  |
| w |  | j |  |

Vowels: /a e i o u ɨ/

Some Cariban languages, like Panare, have a tonal system:

**pë́j** "cassava bread" (high tone)
**pë̀j** "clothes" (low tone)

#### Morphology

Cariban languages are polysynthetic, with complex verbal morphology. They often use both prefixes and suffixes to mark grammatical categories.

Example from Hixkaryana:

**n-oseryeh-yako-no**
3SG-laugh-COMPL-IMMED.PAST
"He just finished laughing"

**m-enmah-no**
2SG-teach-IMMED.PAST
"You just taught"

Cariban languages often have a system of person hierarchy in their verbal morphology, where only the higher-ranking participant is marked on the verb:

**w-enyeh-no**
1SG-see-IMMED.PAST
"I saw him/her/it" (1 > 3)

**oy-onyeh-no**
2SG.3-see-IMMED.PAST
"He/she saw you" (3 > 2)

#### Syntax

Many Cariban languages have an OVS basic word order, which is relatively rare cross-linguistically.

Example from Hixkaryana:

**toto y-ono-no kamara**
man 3SG.3-eat-IMMED.PAST jaguar
"The jaguar ate the man"

Cariban languages often use postpositions and have a system of switch-reference marking in complex sentences:

**n-omok-ye, n-oseryeh-ye**
3SG-come-DEP.SS, 3SG-laugh-DEP.SS
"He came and (he) laughed" (same subject)

**n-omok-ye, k-oseryeh-no**
3SG-come-DEP.DS, 1SG-laugh-IMMED.PAST
"He came and I laughed" (different subject)

## Linguistic Features

### Evidentiality

Many South American languages have grammaticalized evidentiality systems, marking the source of information in statements. This is particularly prominent in Andean languages, but is also found in other families.

Example from Tariana (Arawakan):

**José irida di-manika-ka**
José football 3SG.NONFEM-play-REC.PAST.VIS
"José played football" (I saw it)

**José irida di-manika-mahka**
José football 3SG.NONFEM-play-REC.PAST.NONVIS
"José played football" (I heard it)

**José irida di-manika-nihka**
José football 3SG.NONFEM-play-REC.PAST.INFER
"José played football" (I infer it from evidence)

This system in Tariana distinguishes visual, non-visual, and inferential evidentiality.

### Nasal Harmony

Several language families, including Tupian and some Arawakan languages, exhibit nasal harmony, where nasality spreads across multiple segments.

Example from Guarani (Tupian):

**porã** [põɾã] "beautiful"
**memby** [mẽmb̃ɨ̃] "child"

In these examples, the nasality of one segment spreads to adjacent vowels and even some consonants.

Example from Barasano (Tucanoan):

**mĩpĩ** [mĩpĩ] "hummingbird"
**mãkã** [mãkã] "river"

In Barasano, nasality is a property of the entire morpheme and affects all sonorants within it.

### Ejective Consonants

Ejective consonants are common in Andean languages, including Quechuan and Aymaran families, as well as some neighboring languages.

Example from Aymara:

**p'iqi** [p'iqi] "head"
**t'anta** [t'anta] "bread"
**k'ari** [k'ari] "lie, falsehood"

Example from Jaqaru (Aymaran):

**č'aqa** [tʃ'aqa] "to break"
**q'ipi** [q'ipi] "bundle"

### Polysynthesis

Some South American languages exhibit polysynthetic features, where a single word can express what would require a full sentence in other languages.

Example from Mapudungun (an isolate spoken in Chile and Argentina):

**Leli-nie-ke-fu-i-ñ**
watch-PROG-HAB-PAST-IND-1PL
"We used to be watching it"

Example from Yagán (an isolate formerly spoken in Tierra del Fuego):

**Mamihlapinatapai**
"To look at each other hoping that either will offer to do something which both parties desire but are unwilling to do"

This famous word encapsulates a complex concept in a single lexeme, demonstrating the polysynthetic nature of the language.

### Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction

Many South American languages distinguish between inclusive and exclusive first person plural pronouns.

Example from Quechua:

**Ñuqanchis** "we" (inclusive, including the addressee)
**Ñuqayku** "we" (exclusive, not including the addressee)

Example from Mochica (an extinct language formerly spoken in coastal Peru):

**ixll** "we" (inclusive)
**moiñ** "we" (exclusive)

### Classifier Systems

Some Amazonian languages have elaborate classifier systems, categorizing nouns based on various semantic criteria.

Example from Yagua (Peba-Yaguan family, spoken in Peru):

**tóó-nu** 
tree-CL:TREE
"tree"

**tóó-tu**
tree-CL:BUNDLELIKE
"log"

**tóó-siy**
tree-CL:SLENDER
"stick"

In this example, the same root "tóó" (tree) is classified differently based on its form or use.

Example from Bora (Witotoan family, spoken in Peru and Colombia):

**úméhe-ba**
banana-CL:FRUIT
"banana (fruit)"

**úméhe-i**
banana-CL:PLANT
"banana plant"

**úméhe-ko**
banana-CL:STICK
"banana stalk"

### Switch-Reference

Many South American languages have switch-reference systems, which indicate whether the subject of a dependent clause is the same as or different from the subject of the main clause.

Example from Cavineña (Tacanan family, spoken in Bolivia):

**Tudya =tu-ke mare-kware [e-tata-wa=ke]**
then =3SG-FM see.off-REM.PAST [NPF-go.out-PERF=LIG]
"Then he saw him off when he (the other one) had gone out"

In this example, the ligature =ke indicates that the subject of the dependent clause is different from the subject of the main clause.

## Language Isolates

South America is home to several language isolates, languages that have no demonstrated genetic relationship with any other language. Some notable isolates include:

### Mapudungun

Spoken in Chile and Argentina, Mapudungun has a complex phonological system and agglutinative morphology.

Phonological features include a distinction between dental and alveolar consonants, and a series of interdental consonants:

/t̪/ vs. /t/
/n̪/ vs. /n/
/l̪/ vs. /l/

Example of Mapudungun verbal morphology:

**Leli-fi-ñ**
watch-3OBJ-1SG.IND
"I watch him/her/it"

**Pe-la-fi-mi**
see-NEG-3OBJ-2SG
"You don't see him/her/it"

### Warao

Spoken in Venezuela and Guyana, Warao has a relatively simple phonology but complex morphosyntax.

Example of Warao possessive construction:

**Ma-jobo**
1SG-house
"My house"

**Ji-noko**
1SG-canoe
"My canoe"

Warao has an interesting system of classificatory verbs, where different verbs are used depending on the position or state of the object:

**Nao eku-ai**
I stand-PRES
"I am standing"

**Nao aya-ha**
I sit-PRES
"I am sitting"

### Trumai

Spoken in Brazil, Trumai has an unusual ergative-absolutive alignment and a complex system of verbal serialization.

Example of Trumai ergativity:

**Chï'a hai-ts disi**
child 3SG.ERG-eat fruit
"The child ate the fruit"

**Chï'a ka_ode**
child sleep
"The child slept"

In the first example, the subject of the transitive verb takes the ergative case (marked by -ts), while in the second example, the subject of the intransitive verb is unmarked (absolutive).

### Andoke

Spoken in Colombia, Andoke is known for its complex tonal system and its use of classifiers.

Andoke has four tones: high, low, rising, and falling. These tones can distinguish both lexical and grammatical meaning:

**pǒ** (rising tone) "fish"
**pò** (low tone) "timber"

Andoke also has an extensive classifier system, with over 60 classifiers. For example:

**hɯ̃-ʔo**
water-CL:LIQUID
"water"

**hɯ̃-si**
water-CL:RIVER
"river"

## Endangered Languages

Many indigenous South American languages are critically endangered due to various social, economic, and political factors. Some examples include:

### Kawésqar

Spoken in Chile, Kawésqar has fewer than 10 speakers left. It has a complex phonological system with phonemic glottalization and a rich system of demonstratives.

Example of Kawésqar demonstrative:

**Askártæs**
DEM.PROX.VISIBLE
"This one (visible and close)"

**Askćéjer**
DEM.DIST.INVISIBLE
"That one (distant and not visible)"

### Vilela

Formerly spoken in Argentina, Vilela is now considered extinct. It had a complex system of verbal affixes and an unusual phonological feature of word-final consonant clusters.

Example of Vilela verbal morphology (from historical records):

**Ni-lap-ki-n**
1SG-hit-CAUS-PAST
"I made (someone) hit"

### Yagán

Once spoken in Tierra del Fuego, Yagán is now critically endangered with only one remaining native speaker. It is known for its rich vocabulary related to maritime life and its complex morphology.

Example of Yagán morphological complexity:

**Teki-uina-na-moni-kipa-teka**
look-PROG-STATE-CAUS-INCH-NARR
"He/she began to cause (someone) to be in the state of looking"

This single word encapsulates a complex verbal concept that would require multiple words in many other languages.

## Contact Phenomena

The long history of contact between indigenous languages and colonial languages (primarily Spanish and Portuguese) has led to various contact phenomena:

### Lexical Borrowing

Many indigenous languages have borrowed lexical items from Spanish or Portuguese, especially for introduced concepts.

Example from Guarani:

**vaka** "cow" (from Spanish "vaca")
**kamisa** "shirt" (from Spanish "camisa")

Example from Quechua:

**iskwila** "school" (from Spanish "escuela")
**runa** "person" (native Quechua word)

### Structural Borrowing

Some languages have borrowed structural features from Spanish or Portuguese.

Example: The development of a definite article in Quechua varieties in contact with Spanish:

**Warmi-qa** "the woman" (traditional Quechua)
**La warmi** "the woman" (in some contact varieties, borrowing Spanish "la")

Example from Guarani: The adoption of Spanish conjunctions

**Ha upéi ou la che ermáno**
And then come the my brother
"And then my brother came"

Here, "ha" (and) and "la" (the) are borrowed from Spanish, while the rest of the sentence structure remains Guarani.

### Mixed Languages

In some cases, prolonged contact has led to the development of mixed languages.

Example: Media Lengua, spoken in Ecuador, which combines Quechua grammar with a primarily Spanish-derived lexicon:

**Yo-ga anda-ndu-ni**
I-TOP walk-PROG-1SG
"I am walking"

(Here, "yo" is from Spanish, while the grammatical structure and suffixes are from Quechua)

Another example is Callahuaya, a secret language used by itinerant healers in Bolivia, which combines Quechua grammar with a lexicon derived mainly from Puquina (an extinct language):

**Ñoqa lari-s-qa-y**
I speak-PERF-NMLZ-1SG
"I have spoken"

Here, the grammatical structure is Quechua, but "lari" (speak) is from Puquina.

## Typological Features

South American languages exhibit a wide range of typological features:

### Word Order

While SOV is common (e.g., in Quechua and Aymara), other orders are also found:

SVO: Many Tupian languages
Example from Guaran
