# Historical Indo-European Linguistics

Historical Indo-European Linguistics is the study of the Indo-European language family from a diachronic perspective, focusing on the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) and the historical development of its daughter languages. This field combines comparative linguistics, historical linguistics, and philology to trace the evolution of languages over time.

## Proto-Indo-European

Proto-Indo-European is the hypothetical common ancestor of all Indo-European languages, believed to have been spoken around 4500-2500 BCE. While no written records of PIE exist, linguists have reconstructed many aspects of its grammar and vocabulary through the comparative method.

### Phonology

The phonological system of PIE is reconstructed based on regular sound correspondences between attested Indo-European languages.

#### Consonants

| Manner | Labial | Dental | Palatal | Velar | Labiovelar |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------|------------|
| Stop | p b bʰ | t d dʰ | k̑ g̑ g̑ʰ | k g gʰ | kʷ gʷ gʷʰ |
| Fricative | | s | | | |
| Nasal | m | n | | | |
| Liquid | | l, r | | | |
| Glide | w | | y | | |

Note: Some scholars reconstruct a series of glottalized stops (p' t' k̑' k' kʷ') instead of voiced stops.

The exact nature of the three-way distinction in stops (e.g., *p, *b, *bʰ) has been debated. The traditional reconstruction posits voiceless, voiced, and voiced aspirated stops. However, some linguists argue for an alternative system with voiceless, ejective, and voiced stops.

#### Vowels

| Short | Long |
|-------|------|
| e o a i u | ē ō ā ī ū |

Reconstructed diphthongs: ei, oi, ai, eu, ou, au

The vowel system of PIE was relatively simple, with a central opposition between *e and *o. The status of *a is debated, with some scholars arguing it was a marginal phoneme resulting from laryngeal coloring.

#### Laryngeals

Three “laryngeal” consonants are reconstructed for PIE, conventionally written as h₁, h₂, h₃. Their exact phonetic values are debated, but they had significant effects on neighboring vowels:

- h₁e > e
- h₂e > a
- h₃e > o

The laryngeal theory, proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure and later elaborated by others, has been crucial in explaining various phenomena in daughter languages, including:

1. Vowel coloring: The different outcomes of laryngeals explain vowel qualities in daughter languages.
   Example: PIE *dʰh₁tos “placed” > Greek **thetós**, Sanskrit **hitá-**

2. Consonant lengthening: In some languages, laryngeals caused lengthening of preceding consonants.
   Example: PIE *pih₂-wō(n) “fat” > Greek **pī́ōn**, Sanskrit **pī́van-**

3. Vowel lengthening: When lost between consonants, laryngeals often caused compensatory lengthening.
   Example: PIE *ph₂tēr “father” > Greek **patḗr**, Sanskrit **pitár-**

### Morphology

PIE was a highly inflected language with complex nominal and verbal systems.

#### Nouns

Nouns were inflected for eight cases and three numbers:

| Case | Function |
|------|----------|
| Nominative | Subject |
| Accusative | Direct object |
| Genitive | Possession |
| Dative | Indirect object |
| Locative | Location |
| Instrumental | Means or accompaniment |
| Ablative | Source or separation |
| Vocative | Direct address |

Numbers: Singular, Dual, Plural

Three genders: Masculine, Feminine, Neuter

The gender system in PIE was grammatical rather than strictly based on natural gender. The feminine gender is thought to have developed later, originally being a collective or abstract derivative of the masculine/neuter.

Example reconstruction (word for “horse”):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | *h₁éḱwos | *h₁éḱwōs |
| Accusative | *h₁éḱwom | *h₁éḱwons |
| Genitive | *h₁éḱwosyo | *h₁éḱwōm |
| Dative | *h₁éḱwōi | *h₁éḱwobʰos |
| Locative | *h₁éḱwoi | *h₁éḱwoisu |
| Instrumental | *h₁éḱwoh₁ | *h₁éḱwōis |
| Ablative | *h₁éḱwōd | *h₁éḱwobʰos |
| Vocative | *h₁éḱwe | *h₁éḱwōs |

This paradigm showcases several important features of PIE nominal morphology:

1. Ablaut: Alternation between e-grade (*h₁éḱw-) and o-grade (*h₁éḱw-o-) in different forms.
2. Different endings for different cases and numbers.
3. Syncretism: Some forms share the same ending (e.g., dative and ablative plural).

#### Adjectives

Adjectives in PIE were declined similarly to nouns, agreeing with the nouns they modified in gender, number, and case. Many adjectives had different stem forms for masculine/neuter and feminine.

Example reconstruction (word for “new”):

| Case | Masc./Neut. Sg. | Fem. Sg. | Neut. Pl. |
|------|-----------------|----------|-----------|
| Nom. | *néwos | *néweh₂ | *néweh₂ |
| Acc. | *néwom | *néweh₂m | *néweh₂ |
| Gen. | *néwosyo | *néweh₂es | *néweh₂ōm |

This paradigm illustrates the thematic (*o-stem) inflection for masculine/neuter and the *eh₂-stem inflection for feminine.

#### Pronouns

PIE had a complex system of pronouns, including personal, demonstrative, interrogative, and relative pronouns. Personal pronouns distinguished first, second, and third persons, but third-person pronouns may have originated from demonstratives.

Example reconstruction (first-person singular pronoun):

| Case | Form |
|------|------|
| Nom. | *h₁eǵ(oH) |
| Acc. | *h₁mé |
| Gen. | *h₁méne |
| Dat. | *h₁mói |

Demonstrative pronouns often formed the basis for definite articles in daughter languages. PIE is reconstructed with several demonstrative stems, including *so-/to- (forming the basis of English “the” and “that”) and *k̑i-/k̑e- (cf. Latin “hic, haec, hoc”).

#### Verbs

PIE verbs were conjugated for:

- Person: 1st, 2nd, 3rd
- Number: Singular, Dual, Plural
- Tense: Present, Aorist, Perfect
- Mood: Indicative, Subjunctive, Optative, Imperative
- Voice: Active, Middle-Passive

Verbs had complex ablaut patterns, with different root grades in different forms:

- e-grade: *bʰér-e-ti “he carries”
- o-grade: *bʰór-os “burden”
- zero-grade: *bʰr̥-tós “carried”

Example reconstruction (root *bʰer- “to carry”):

Present indicative active:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | *bʰér-oh₂ | *bʰér-o-mes |
| 2nd | *bʰér-e-si | *bʰér-e-te |
| 3rd | *bʰér-e-ti | *bʰér-o-nti |

This paradigm illustrates several key features of PIE verbal morphology:

1. Thematic vowel *-e-/-o- alternating in different persons
2. Primary endings (*-ti, *-nti) used for present indicative
3. Ablaut in the root (here, consistent e-grade)

The PIE verbal system also included:

1. Athematic verbs: Verbs without a thematic vowel, often showing ablaut in the root.
   Example: *h₁és-mi “I am”, *h₁s-énti “they are”

2. Aorist: A past tense form, often with zero-grade root in athematic forms.
   Example: *gʷém-t “he/she went” (root *gʷem- “to go”)

3. Perfect: Indicated a state resulting from past action, formed with o-grade root and specific endings.
   Example: *de-dórk-e “he has seen” (root *derk- “to see”)

4. Middle voice: Indicated that the subject was also somehow affected by the action.
   Example: *bʰér-e-tor “he carries (for himself)”

5. Non-finite forms: Included participles, infinitives, and verbal nouns.
   Example: *bʰér-ont- “carrying” (present active participle)

### Syntax

PIE is reconstructed as having a relatively free word order, with SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) being the most common. Modifiers generally followed the modified element.

Example sentence:
***wīrós h₁éḱwom h₂ég̑eti**
“The man drives the horse”

Other syntactic features of PIE included:

1. Use of particles for emphasis and to express subtle meanings
2. Extensive use of parataxis (coordinate clauses) rather than hypotaxis (subordinate clauses)
3. Use of case forms rather than prepositions to express many relationships

## Sound Changes

One of the key aspects of historical Indo-European linguistics is tracing the sound changes that led from PIE to the attested daughter languages. Some important sound laws include:

### Grimm's Law

This describes the consonant shifts that occurred in Proto-Germanic:

1. PIE voiceless stops > Germanic voiceless fricatives
   *p > f, *t > θ, *k > h
   Example: PIE *pōds “foot” > Proto-Germanic *fōts

2. PIE voiced stops > Germanic voiceless stops
   *b > p, *d > t, *g > k
   Example: PIE *dekm̥ “ten” > Proto-Germanic *tehun

3. PIE voiced aspirated stops > Germanic voiced fricatives (later stops)
   *bʰ > β (b), *dʰ > ð (d), *gʰ > ɣ (g)
   Example: PIE *bʰrāter- “brother” > Proto-Germanic *brōþēr

Grimm's Law explains many of the systematic differences between Germanic languages and their Indo-European cousins. For instance, it accounts for why English “father” begins with [f], while Latin “pater” begins with [p].

### Verner's Law

Verner's Law, named after Danish linguist Karl Verner, explains apparent exceptions to Grimm's Law in Germanic languages. It states that voiceless fricatives resulting from Grimm's Law became voiced if the preceding syllable did not carry the main stress in PIE.

Example:
PIE *ph₂tḗr “father” > Proto-Germanic *fadēr (not *faþēr)

This law explains alternations in some Germanic strong verbs:
Old English **cēosan** “to choose” (s < *s) vs. **curon** “they chose” (r < *z < *s)

### Grassmann's Law

This describes a dissimilation of aspirates in Indo-Iranian and Greek:

When a root has two aspirated consonants, the first one loses its aspiration.

Example: PIE *bʰeudʰ- “to be aware” > Sanskrit **bodh-**, Greek **peuth-**

This law operates independently in Greek and Sanskrit, showing that it occurred after the split of these branches from PIE.

### Ruki Rule

In Indo-Iranian, Balto-Slavic, and Armenian, *s becomes *š after *r, *u, *k, or *i:

Example: PIE *mus- “mouse” > Sanskrit **muṣ-**, but Latin **mūs**

This shared innovation is one piece of evidence for a closer relationship between these branches.

### Centum-Satem Isogloss

This divides the IE languages based on the treatment of the PIE palatals:

- Centum languages (Western IE): Merged palatals with velars
  Example: PIE *ḱm̥tóm “hundred” > Latin **centum**, Greek **hekaton**

- Satem languages (Eastern IE): Palatals become sibilants
  Example: PIE *ḱm̥tóm “hundred” > Sanskrit **śatam**, Lithuanian **šimtas**

This isogloss was once thought to represent a fundamental split in the IE family, but it's now recognized that the changes occurred independently in different branches.

### Bartholomae's Law

This sound law, operating in Indo-Iranian, describes the interaction of aspirated stops when they come into contact:

When a voiced aspirated stop is followed by a voiceless stop, the sequence becomes voiced aspirated + voiced unaspirated.

Example: PIE *bʰudʰ-to- > Sanskrit **buddha-** “awakened” (not *budʰta-)

## Major Indo-European Branches

### Indo-Iranian

Includes languages like Sanskrit, Persian, and Hindi.

Key features:
- Merger of *a, *e, *o > a
- Satem development of palatals
- Retention of many archaic features in Vedic Sanskrit

Example (Sanskrit):
**devā́nāṃ priyáḥ**
“beloved of the gods”

The Indo-Iranian branch is noted for its early attestation (Vedic Sanskrit) and the preservation of many archaic features. It's divided into three main sub-branches:

1. Indo-Aryan: Includes Sanskrit and its descendants like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi.
2. Iranian: Includes Persian, Kurdish, and Pashto.
3. Nuristani: A small group of languages spoken in Afghanistan, sometimes considered a third branch of Indo-Iranian.

### Greek

Attested from Mycenaean times (Linear B) to the present day.

Key features:
- Retention of augment in past tenses
- Loss of labiovelars (*kʷ > p/t/k)
- Distinctive development of syllabic resonants (*r̥ > ar/ra, *l̥ > al/la)

Example (Ancient Greek):
**ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, Μοῦσα**
ándra moi énnepe, Moûsa
“Tell me, O Muse, of the man”

Greek is notable for its long and well-documented history, allowing linguists to trace changes over time. Major periods include:

1. Mycenaean Greek (c. 1600-1100 BCE)
2. Ancient Greek (c. 800-300 BCE), with major dialects like Attic, Ionic, Doric
3. Koine Greek (c. 300 BCE - 300 CE)
4. Medieval Greek (c. 300-1453 CE)
5. Modern Greek (1453 CE - present)

### Italic

Includes Latin and its descendants, the Romance languages.

Key features:
- Loss of aspirated stops
- Development of new future tenses
- Reduction of case system in Romance languages

Example (Latin):
**Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres**
“All Gaul is divided into three parts”

The Italic branch initially included other languages of ancient Italy, such as Oscan and Umbrian, but these became extinct, leaving Latin as the sole ancestor of modern Italic (Romance) languages. Major Romance languages include:

1. French
2. Spanish
3. Italian
4. Portuguese
5. Romanian
6. Catalan

Each of these languages has developed unique features from their Latin ancestor. For instance:

French:
- Loss of final unstressed vowels: Latin **rosa** > French **rose** [ʁoz]
- Development of nasal vowels: Latin **bonum** > French **bon** [bɔ̃]

Spanish:
- Diphthongization of short e and o: Latin **terra** > Spanish **tierra**
- Development of palatalized n: Latin **annum** > Spanish **año**

Italian:
- Retention of geminate consonants: Latin **annum** > Italian **anno**
- Lenition of intervocalic stops: Latin **ripa** > Italian **riva**

Romanian:
- Retention of three-gender system (masculine, feminine, neuter)
- Development of a postposed definite article: **lupul** “the wolf”

### Celtic

Includes Irish, Welsh, and extinct languages like Gaulish.

Key features:
- Loss of PIE *p
- Development of initial mutations
- VSO word order in Insular Celtic

Example (Old Irish):
**Mōr in gním**
“Great (is) the deed”

The Celtic languages are divided into two main branches:

1. Continental Celtic (all extinct):
   - Gaulish
   - Celtiberian
   - Lepontic

2. Insular Celtic:
   - Goidelic (Gaelic): Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx
   - Brythonic: Welsh, Breton, Cornish

Celtic languages are known for their complex systems of initial consonant mutations, where the initial consonant of a word changes based on grammatical context. For example, in Welsh:

**pen** “head” > **fy mhen** “my head” (nasal mutation)
**tad** “father” > **ei dad** “his father” (soft mutation)

### Germanic

Includes English, German, and Scandinavian languages.

Key features:
- Grimm's Law and Verner's Law consonant shifts
- Development of weak and strong verb distinction
- Fixed stress on root syllable

Example (Gothic):
**Atta unsar þu in himinam**
“Our Father, you in heaven”

The Germanic branch is divided into three main sub-branches:

1. East Germanic (extinct): Gothic
2. North Germanic: Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroese
3. West Germanic: English, German, Dutch, Frisian, Yiddish

Germanic languages are characterized by:

- Strong and weak verb conjugations:
  Strong: English **sing, sang, sung**
  Weak: English **talk, talked, talked**

- Umlaut (vowel mutation):
  Old English **fōt** “foot”, plural **fēt** (modern “feet”)

- Development of a dental suffix for past tense in weak verbs:
  Gothic **nasida** “saved”, English **saved**, German **rettete**

### Balto-Slavic

Includes Lithuanian, Russian, and Polish.

Key features:
- Satem development of palatals
- Retention of archaic features in Lithuanian
- Development of aspect in verbs in Slavic

Example (Old Church Slavonic):
**Отьче нашь, иже еси на небесѣхъ**
Otĭče našĭ, iže jesi na nebesěxŭ
“Our Father, who art in heaven”

The Balto-Slavic branch is divided into:

1. Baltic:
   - East Baltic: Lithuanian, Latvian
   - West Baltic: Old Prussian (extinct)

2. Slavic:
   - East Slavic: Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian
   - West Slavic: Polish, Czech, Slovak
   - South Slavic: Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Slovenian

Lithuanian is often noted for its conservatism, retaining many archaic features of PIE. For example:

- Retention of PIE *ei: Lithuanian **eiti** “to go” (cf. Greek **eimi** “I go”)
- Preservation of the PIE accent system

Slavic languages are characterized by:

- Robust aspect system in verbs:
  Russian **читать** (imperfective) vs. **прочитать** (perfective) “to read”

- Palatal consonants:
  Russian **нять** [nʲatʲ] “to crumple”

### Armenian

An independent branch with only one language.

Key features:
- Unique consonant shifts
- Development of definite article suffix
- Loss of grammatical gender

Example (Classical Armenian):
**Հայր մեր որ յերկինս ես**
Hayr mer or yerkins es
“Our Father who art in heaven”

Armenian shows some affinities with Greek and Indo-Iranian, but is generally classified as its own branch. It has undergone significant sound changes, making its relationship to other IE languages less immediately obvious. For example:

PIE *pṓds “foot” > Armenian **ոտք** (otk')

### Albanian

Another independent branch with only one language.

Key features:
- Extensive borrowing from Latin and Greek
- Development of postposed definite article
- Retention of case system

Example:
**Ati ynë që je në qiell**
“Our Father who art in heaven”

Albanian has been heavily influenced by neighboring languages, but retains a core IE vocabulary and grammar. It shows some unique developments:

- PIE *sh₂ēns “moon” > Albanian **hënë**
- Development of admirative mood: **punuaka** “I am working, apparently”

### Anatolian

Extinct branch including Hittite, the earliest attested IE language.

Key features:
- Retention of laryngeals as consonants
- Simpler verbal system than PIE
- Archaic nominal system

Example (Hittite):
**nu-uš-ša-an an-da ša-li-ga-aš GIŠlu-ut-ta-a-i**
nu=šan anda šaligaš luttāi
“And he runs into the booth”

The discovery and decipherment of Hittite in the early 20th century had a significant impact on IE studies. It provided evidence for the laryngeal theory and showed that some features of PIE, such as the feminine gender, may have developed after Anatolian split from the rest of the IE family.

### Tocharian

Extinct branch spoken in western China.

Key features:
- Centum development despite eastern location
- Loss of voiced consonants
- Complex system of vowel alternations

Example (Tocharian B):
**ñäktets käṣṣi ñem klyu tsopats**
“The god's teacher's name was heard”

Tocharian, discovered in the early 20th century, consists of two closely related languages: Tocharian A and Tocharian B. Its centum character, despite its eastern location, challenged the idea of a clean east-west split in the IE family.

## Comparative Method

The comparative method is the primary tool used in historical linguistics to reconstruct proto-languages and trace language relationships. It involves:

1. Identifying cognates across related languages
2. Establishing regular sound correspondences
3. Reconstructing proto-forms
4. Proposing sound laws to explain divergences

Example:
Latin **pater**, Sanskrit **pitár-**, Greek **patḗr**, Gothic **fadar**

Sound correspondences:
- Initial p- in Latin, Sanskrit, Greek vs. f- in Gothic (Grimm's Law)
- -t- in all languages
- Different vowels due to ablaut and specific language developments

Reconstructed PIE form: ***ph₂tḗr**

The comparative method relies on the principle that sound changes are regular and systematic. This allows linguists to posit “sound laws” that explain the development of sounds in different linguistic environments.

## Ablaut

Ablaut refers to systematic alternations in root vowels in PIE and its descendants. The main grades are:

- e-grade: *bʰer- “carry”
- o-grade: *bʰor- 
- zero-grade: *bʰr̥-
- lengthened e-grade: *bʰēr-
- lengthened o-grade: *bʰōr-

Example in Greek:
- Present: **pʰérō** “I carry” (e-grade)
- Aorist: **é-pʰor-on** “I carried” (o-grade)
- Verbal noun: **pʰór-os** “tribute” (o-grade)
- Adjective: **pʰor-tós** “carried” (zero-grade)

Ablaut played a crucial role in PIE morphology, marking different grammatical categories and derivational processes. In many daughter languages, original ablaut alternations have been obscured by sound changes or analogical leveling, but traces remain in irregular verbs and derivational patterns.

## Accent and Intonation

PIE is reconstructed as having a pitch accent system, which is preserved in Vedic Sanskrit and Ancient Greek.

Example (Vedic Sanskrit):
**agním īḷe puróhitaṃ**
“I praise Agni, the household priest”

The acute accent marks high pitch on the syllable.

In some branches, the accent shifted:
- Fixed initial stress in Germanic and Czech
- Fixed penultimate stress in Polish
- Fixed final stress in French

The PIE accent system interacted with ablaut, with unaccented syllables often showing zero-grade vocalism. This interaction is particularly visible in Greek and Sanskrit:

Greek **patḗr** (nom. sg.) vs. **patrós** (gen. sg.) “father”
Sanskrit **pitā́** (nom. sg.) vs. **pitrā́** (instr. sg.) “father”

## Semantic Change

Tracking semantic changes is an important part of historical linguistics. Common types include:

1. Broadening: PIE ***ghostis* “stranger” > Latin **hostis** “enemy”
2. Narrowing: Old English **deor** “animal” > Modern English “deer”
3. Amelioration: Old English **cnafa** “boy, servant” > Modern English “knave”
4. Pejoration: Old English **sǣlig** “blessed” > Modern English “silly”

Other types of semantic change include:

5. Metaphorical extension: PIE **mūs* “mouse” > computer “mouse”
6. Metonymy: Latin **coxa** “hip” > French **cuisse** “thigh”
7. Euphemism: Proto-Germanic **dauþuz* “death” > German **Ableben** “passing”

Understanding semantic changes is crucial for tracing the development of vocabulary and for accurate reconstruction of PIE lexicon.

## Lexical Innovation

Indo-European languages have developed new vocabulary through various means:

1. Compounding: German **Fernseher** “television” (lit. “far-seer”)
2. Derivation: English **un-think-able**
3. Borrowing: English **croissant** from French
4. Calquing: German **Wolkenkratzer** “skyscraper” (lit. “cloud-scraper”)

These processes have been active throughout the history of IE languages, leading to significant vocabulary differences even between closely related languages. For example:

- Compounding in Germanic languages: German **Handschuh** “glove” (lit. “hand-shoe”)
- Extensive borrowing in English: **beef** (from Old French), **sky** (from Old Norse)
- Calquing in Slavic languages: Russian **небоскрёб** (neboskrjob) “skyscraper” (calque of English)

## Subgrouping

Determining the relationships between IE languages is an ongoing process. Some well-established subgroups include:

- Italic and Celtic (Italo-Celtic)
- Baltic and Slavic (Balto-Slavic)
- Indo-Iranian

More controversial proposals include:
- Greco-Armenian
- Germano-Baltic

The exact structure of the IE family tree remains a subject of debate. Some linguists propose a “bush” model rather than a tree, suggesting that many branches split off from PIE in relatively quick succession.

## Writing Systems

Indo-European languages have been written in various scripts:

- Latin alphabet: Used for most Western European languages
- Cyrillic: Used for many Slavic languages
- Greek alphabet: Used for Greek
- Devanagari: Used for Sanskrit and many modern Indian languages
- Cuneiform: Used for Hittite and other Anatolian languages
- Ogham: Ancient Irish script

Example (Russian Cyrillic):
**Мой дядя самых честных правил**
Moj djadja samyx čestnyx pravil
“My uncle has most honest principles”

The choice and development of writing systems have been influenced by cultural and historical factors. For example:

- The spread of Christianity led to the adoption of the Latin alphabet in many European languages
- The Cyrillic alphabet was developed for Slavic languages based on Greek letters
- The Brahmi script, ancestor of many South Asian scripts, may have been influenced by Semitic scripts

## Linguistic Paleontology

This involves using reconstructed vocabulary to make inferences about PIE culture and homeland. Key terms include:

- ***reg̑-* “king”: suggests social hierarchy
- ***kwekwlos* “wheel”: implies knowledge of wheeled vehicles
- ***h₂erg̑ntom* “silver”: indicates metallurgy
- ***h₁ek̑wos* “horse”: suggests importance of horses

These terms have led to various theories about PIE homeland and culture, such as the Kurgan hypothesis.

Linguistic paleontology must be used cautiously, as words can change meaning over time or be borrowed between cultures. However, it can provide valuable insights when combined with archaeological and genetic evidence.

This overview covers many of the key aspects of historical Indo-European linguistics, from the reconstruction of PIE to the development and characteristics of its daughter languages. The field continues to evolve as new evidence emerges and analytical techniques improve.
