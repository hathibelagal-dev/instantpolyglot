# Zulu

Zulu, also known as isiZulu, is a Bantu language spoken primarily in South Africa. It is one of the country's 11 official languages and is the most widely spoken first language in South Africa, with an estimated 12 million native speakers. Zulu belongs to the Nguni subgroup of Bantu languages and is closely related to Xhosa, Swati, and Ndebele.

The Zulu language has a rich history intertwined with the Zulu people's cultural heritage. It gained prominence during the reign of King Shaka Zulu in the early 19th century, who unified various clans into the Zulu Kingdom. Today, Zulu is not only spoken in South Africa but also in parts of neighboring countries such as Lesotho, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), and Zimbabwe.

## Phonology and Orthography

Zulu uses the Latin alphabet with some modifications. The language has a rich phonological system with distinctive features such as clicks and tonal contrasts. The current orthography was standardized in the 1950s and has remained largely unchanged since then.

### Vowels

Zulu has five basic vowel sounds:

| Letter | IPA | Description | Example |
|--------|-----|-------------|---------|
| a | [a] | Open front unrounded vowel | **amasi** (sour milk) |
| e | [ɛ] | Open-mid front unrounded vowel | **ekhaya** (at home) |
| i | [i] | Close front unrounded vowel | **izulu** (weather, sky) |
| o | [ɔ] | Open-mid back rounded vowel | **ubaba** (father) |
| u | [u] | Close back rounded vowel | **umuntu** (person) |

Vowel length is not phonemic in Zulu, meaning that the duration of a vowel does not change the meaning of a word. However, vowels may be lengthened in certain grammatical constructions or for emphasis in speech.

### Consonants

Zulu has a complex consonant system, including clicks, which are represented by the letters c, q, and x. Here's a comprehensive table of Zulu consonants:

| Letter | IPA | Description | Example |
|--------|-----|-------------|---------|
| b | [ɓ] | Voiced bilabial implosive | **ibhola** (ball) |
| bh | [b] | Voiced bilabial plosive | **ubhabha** (to flutter) |

| qh | [ǃʰ] | Aspirated postalveolar click | **qhuma** (explode) |
| s | [s] | Voiceless alveolar fricative | **isisu** (stomach) |
| sh | [ʃ] | Voiceless palato-alveolar fricative | **ishumi** (ten) |
| t | [t'] | Ejective alveolar plosive | **itamati** (tomato) |
| th | [tʰ] | Aspirated alveolar plosive | **uthando** (love) |

| y | [j] | Voiced palatal approximant | **iyona** (it is) |
| z | [z] | Voiced alveolar fricative | **izulu** (weather, sky) |

### Clicks

Clicks are a distinctive feature of Zulu and some other Southern African languages. There are three basic clicks in Zulu:

1. Dental click (c) [ǀ]: Produced by pressing the tip of the tongue against the front teeth and quickly pulling it back.
   Example: **icici** [iǀiǀi] (earring)

2. Postalveolar click (q) [ǃ]: Made by curling the tip of the tongue against the roof of the mouth and pulling it forward and down quickly.
   Example: **iqanda** [iǃanda] (egg)

3. Lateral click (x) [ǁ]: Created by placing the tongue against the side teeth and sucking in air on one side.
   Example: **ixoxo** [iǁɔǁɔ] (frog)

Each click can be combined with other sounds to create different consonants:

- Voiced clicks: 
  **gc** [ᶢǀ]: **igceke** (yard)
  **gq** [ᶢǃ]: **gqoka** (wear)
  **gx** [ᶢǁ]: **gxeka** (criticize)

- Nasalized clicks:
  **nc** [ⁿǀ]: **incwadi** (book)
  **nq** [ⁿǃ]: **inqola** (wagon)
  **nx** [ⁿǁ]: **inxeba** (wound)

- Aspirated clicks:
  **ch** [ǀʰ]: **chaza** (explain)
  **qh** [ǃʰ]: **qhuma** (explode)
  **xh** [ǁʰ]: **xhuma** (jump)

The use of clicks in Zulu adds a unique dimension to its phonology and can be challenging for non-native speakers to master.

### Tone

Zulu is a tonal language, with two basic tones: high and low. Tone can distinguish between otherwise identical words. However, tone is not marked in the standard orthography. This can sometimes lead to ambiguity in written Zulu, which is typically resolved through context. Here are some examples of minimal pairs distinguished by tone:

- **ukubala** (low-low-low-low) means “to count”
- **ukubala** (low-low-low-high) means “to write”

- **uthando** (low-low-low) means “love”
- **uthando** (low-high-low) means “wood”

- **amabele** (low-low-low-low) means “sorghum”
- **amabele** (low-low-low-high) means “breasts”

While tone is crucial in spoken Zulu, native speakers naturally interpret the correct meaning based on context in written form. For learners, it's important to practice with native speakers to grasp the tonal distinctions.

### Syllable Structure

The most common syllable structure in Zulu is CV (Consonant-Vowel). However, other structures are possible:

- V: **u-** (prefix for class 1a nouns)
- CV: **ba-** (prefix for class 2 nouns)
- CCV: **mla** (in **umlambo**, river)
- CCCV: **ntwa** (in **intwa**, fight)

Zulu does not allow consonant clusters at the end of syllables, which is why many loanwords are adapted to fit this pattern. For example, the English word “desk” becomes **idesiki** in Zulu.

## Morphology

Zulu is an agglutinative language with a complex system of prefixes and suffixes that modify the meaning of words. This morphological richness allows for the expression of nuanced meanings through the combination of various affixes.

### Noun Classes

One of the most distinctive features of Zulu, like other Bantu languages, is its system of noun classes. There are 15 noun classes in Zulu, each with its own prefix. These classes generally group nouns by semantic categories, although there are many exceptions. Here's a detailed overview of the Zulu noun classes:

| Class | Singular Prefix | Plural Prefix | Typical Meanings | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | um- | aba- (2) | People | **umuntu** (person), **abafundi** (students) |
| 1a | u- | o- (2a) | Kinship terms, proper names | **ubaba** (father), **ogogo** (grandmothers) |
| 3 | um- | imi- (4) | Trees, plants, natural phenomena | **umuthi** (tree), **imililo** (fires) |
| 5 | i(li)- | ama- (6) | Paired body parts, collections | **iliso** (eye), **amazinyo** (teeth) |
| 7 | isi- | izi- (8) | Languages, tools, miscellaneous | **isitsha** (dish), **izilimi** (languages) |
| 9 | in- | izin- (10) | Animals, abstract concepts | **inkomo** (cow), **izindaba** (news) |
| 11 | u(lu)- | izin- (10) | Long thin objects, abstracts | **uthi** (stick), **izinti** (sticks) |
| 14 | ubu- | -- | Abstract concepts | **ubuhle** (beauty) |
| 15 | uku- | -- | Infinitives | **ukuhamba** (to walk) |

Additional classes:

| Class | Prefix | Usage | Examples |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| 16 | pha- | Locative (on, at) | **phansi** (down, below) |
| 17 | ku- | Locative (to, from) | **kubo** (to them) |
| 18 | mu- | Locative (in, inside) | **emuhle** (inside) |

The noun class system in Zulu affects not only the nouns themselves but also the agreement of adjectives, pronouns, and verbs with these nouns. This system of concordance is a fundamental aspect of Zulu grammar.

### Noun Class Agreement

The noun class system in Zulu requires that other parts of speech agree with the noun they relate to. This agreement is shown through concordial prefixes. Here are some examples:

1. Adjective Agreement:
   **umuntu omkhulu** (a big person) - Class 1
   **abantu abakhulu** (big people) - Class 2
   **isilwane esikhulu** (a big animal) - Class 7
   **izilwane ezinkulu** (big animals) - Class 8

2. Possessive Agreement:
   **incwadi yami** (my book) - Class 9
   **izincwadi zami** (my books) - Class 10
   **umuthi wakhe** (his/her tree) - Class 3
   **imithi yakhe** (his/her trees) - Class 4

3. Subject Concord (used with verbs):
   **Umuntu uyahamba** (The person is walking) - Class 1
   **Abantu bayahamba** (The people are walking) - Class 2
   **Inja iyagijima** (The dog is running) - Class 9
   **Izinja ziyagijima** (The dogs are running) - Class 10

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Zulu are relatively few in number compared to languages like English. Many concepts that would be expressed by adjectives in English are expressed through other grammatical structures in Zulu. True adjectives in Zulu include words for size, color, and some qualities. Here are some common adjectives:

- **-khulu** (big): **indlu enkulu** (a big house)
- **-ncane** (small): **ingane encane** (a small child)
- **-de** (tall, long): **umuntu omude** (a tall person)
- **-fusha** (short): **indlela emfushane** (a short road)
- **-mhlophe** (white): **ingubo emhlophe** (a white cloth)
- **-nsundu** (brown): **inja ensundu** (a brown dog)
- **-bi** (bad, ugly): **isimo esibi** (a bad situation)
- **-hle** (good, beautiful): **intombazane enhle** (a beautiful girl)

- Class 9/10: **en-/ezin-**: **indlu enkulu** (a big house), **izindlu ezinkulu** (big houses)
- Class 11: **olu-**: **uthi olude** (a long stick)
- Class 14: **obu-**: **ubuso obuhle** (a beautiful face)

### Verbs

Zulu verbs are highly inflected, with various prefixes and suffixes indicating tense, aspect, mood, and agreement with the subject and sometimes the object. The verb system is one of the most complex aspects of Zulu grammar.

#### Verb Structure

A typical Zulu verb consists of the following parts:

(Subject Concord) + (Tense/Aspect Marker) + (Object Concord) + Verb Root + (Extensions) + Final Vowel

For example:

**Ngiyakuthanda** (I love you)
- Ngi- (I, subject concord)
- -ya- (present tense marker)
- -ku- (you, object concord)
- -thand- (love, verb root)
- -a (final vowel)

#### Tenses

Zulu has several tenses. Here are some of the main ones with examples:

1. Present Tense:
   Simple: **Ngidlala** (I play)
   Continuous: **Ngiyadlala** (I am playing)

2. Past Tense:
   Recent Past: **Ngidlalile** (I played - today or yesterday)
   Remote Past: **Ngadlala** (I played - some time ago)

3. Future Tense:
   Near Future: **Ngizodlala** (I will play - soon)
   Remote Future: **Ngiyodlala** (I will play - in the distant future)

4. Perfect Tense:
   **Ngidlalile** (I have played)

Examples in context:

- Present: **Ngifunda isiZulu** (I study Zulu)
- Present Continuous: **Ngiyafunda isiZulu** (I am studying Zulu)
- Recent Past: **Ngifunde isiZulu izolo** (I studied Zulu yesterday)
- Remote Past: **Ngafunda isiZulu ngonyaka odlule** (I studied Zulu last year)
- Near Future: **Ngizofunda isiZulu kusasa** (I will study Zulu tomorrow)
- Remote Future: **Ngiyofunda isiZulu ngonyaka ozayo** (I will study Zulu next year)
- Perfect: **Sengifundile isiZulu** (I have already studied Zulu)

#### Verb Extensions

Verb extensions are suffixes that modify the meaning of the verb. They are a crucial feature of Zulu verbs, allowing for the expression of various nuances. Here are some common extensions:

1. Causative (-is-): 
   **ukufunda** (to learn) → **ukufundisa** (to teach)
   **ukudla** (to eat) → **ukudlisa** (to feed)

2. Applicative (-el-): 
   **ukudla** (to eat) → **ukudlela** (to eat for/with)
   **ukulima** (to cultivate) → **ukulimela** (to cultivate for)

3. Passive (-w-): 
   **ukuthanda** (to love) → **ukuthandwa** (to be loved)
   **ukubona** (to see) → **ukubonwa** (to be seen)

4. Reciprocal (-an-):
   **ukubona** (to see) → **ukubonana** (to see each other)
   **ukushaya** (to hit) → **ukushayana** (to hit each other)

5. Intensive (-isis-):
   **ukufunda** (to read/study) → **ukufundisisa** (to study intensively)

6. Reversive (-ul-):
   **ukuvala** (to close) → **ukuvula** (to open)

These extensions can be combined to create more complex meanings:

**ukufundisana** (to teach each other) - combines causative and reciprocal
**ukulimelana** (to cultivate for each other) - combines applicative and reciprocal

#### Negation in Verbs

Negation in Zulu verbs is typically indicated by the prefix **a-** or **awa-** for the subject concord, and changing the final vowel of the verb to **-i**. The pattern can vary depending on the tense and mood. Here are some examples:

Positive: **Ngiyahamba** (I am going)
Negative: **Angihambí** (I am not going)

Positive: **Uyadla** (You are eating)
Negative: **Awudli** (You are not eating)

Positive: **Sizofika** (We will arrive)
Negative: **Asizofikí** (We will not arrive)

Positive: **Bambonile** (They have seen him/her)
Negative: **Abambonanga** (They have not seen him/her)

### Pronouns

Zulu has several types of pronouns, including personal, demonstrative, and relative pronouns.

#### Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Zulu agree with the noun class of the referent:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | mina (I, me) | thina (we, us) |
| 2nd | wena (you) | nina (you all) |
| 3rd (Class 1/2) | yena (he, she, it) | bona (they, them) |
| 3rd (Class 3/4) | wona (it) | yona (they, them) |
| 3rd (Class 5/6) | lona (it) | wona (they, them) |
| 3rd (Class 7/8) | sona (it) | zona (they, them) |
| 3rd (Class 9/10) | yona (it) | zona (they, them) |

Examples in sentences:

- **Mina ngiyafunda** (I am studying)
- **Wena uyacula** (You are singing)
- **Yena uhamba** (He/She is walking)
- **Thina siyadlala** (We are playing)
- **Nina niyasebenza** (You all are working)
- **Bona bayathenga** (They are buying)

#### Demonstrative Pronouns

Zulu has three sets of demonstrative pronouns, indicating proximity:

1. Near the speaker: 
   - **lo muntu** (this person)
   - **lezi zinto** (these things)

2. Near the addressee:
   - **lowo muntu** (that person)
   - **lezo zinto** (those things)

3. Far from both:
   - **loya muntu** (that person over there)
   - **lezoyana zinto** (those things over there)

Examples in context:

- **Lo muntu uhlala lapha** (This person lives here)
- **Lezi zincwadi zinhle** (These books are beautiful)
- **Ngithanda lowo muthi** (I like that tree)
- **Lezo zindlu zindala** (Those houses are old)
- **Uyambona loya mfana?** (Do you see that boy over there?)
- **Lezoyana zinkomo ziyabuya** (Those cows over there are returning)

#### Relative Pronouns

Relative pronouns in Zulu are formed by adding a relative concord to the verb. The relative concord varies depending on the noun class of the antecedent. For example:

- Class 1: **umuntu omdala** (the person who is old)
- Class 2: **abantu abadala** (the people who are old)
- Class 7: **isitsha esisindayo** (the dish that is heavy)
- Class 9: **indlu entsha** (the house that is new)

Examples in sentences:

- **Ngibona umuntu ohambayo** (I see a person who is walking)
- **Izingane ezidlalayo ziyahleka** (The children who are playing are laughing)
- **Incwadi engiyifundayo inhle** (The book that I am reading is beautiful)

## Syntax

### Basic Word Order

The basic word order in Zulu is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). For example:

**UThemba udla ukudla** (Themba eats food)
- UThemba (Subject)
- udla (Verb)
- ukudla (Object)

However, because of the extensive use of concords and agreement markers, the word order can be quite flexible without losing meaning. For instance:

**Ukudla uThemba uyakudla** (The food, Themba is eating it)

This flexibility allows for emphasis on different parts of the sentence.

### Questions

Yes/no questions in Zulu are often formed by changing the intonation of a statement. For example:

Statement: **UThemba udla ukudla** (Themba eats food)
Question: **UThemba udla ukudla?** (Does Themba eat food?)

Wh-questions use question words such as:

- **ubani** (who): **Ubani lo?** (Who is this?)
- **-ni** (what): **Ufunani?** (What do you want?)
- **nini** (when): **Ubuya nini?** (When are you coming back?)
- **phi** (where): **Uhlala phi?** (Where do you live?)
- **ngani** (why): **Ukhala ngani?** (Why are you crying?)
- **kanjani** (how): **Wenza kanjani lokho?** (How do you do that?)

Examples:
**Udlani?** (What are you eating?)
**Uhamba nini?** (When are you going?)
**Nikuphi isikole?** (Where is the school?)

### Negation

Negation in Zulu is typically indicated by the prefix **a-** or **awa-** for the subject concord, and changing the final vowel of the verb to **-i**. For example:

Positive: **Ngiyahamba** (I am going)
Negative: **Angihambi** (I am not going)

Positive: **Uyadla** (You are eating)
Negative: **Awudli** (You are not eating)

Positive: **Bayathenga** (They are buying)
Negative: **Abathengi** (They are not buying)

In the past tense, the negative is formed differently:

Positive: **Ngihambile** (I went)
Negative: **Angihambanga** (I did not go)

### Copulative Sentences

Copulative sentences (equational sentences) in Zulu don’t use a verb “to be”. Instead, they use prefixes that agree with the subject's noun class. For example:

**UThemba ungumfundi** (Themba is a student)
- U- (Class 1 subject prefix)
- -ngu- (copulative prefix for Class 1)
- umfundi (student)

**Leli yikhaya lami** (This is my home)
- Leli (This, Class 5)
- yi- (copulative prefix for Class 5)
- ikhaya (home)
- lami (my)

More examples:

**Ingane iyingane** (A child is a child)
**Izinja zizinja** (Dogs are dogs)
**Amehlo akhe amahle** (His/her eyes are beautiful)

### Locatives

Locatives in Zulu are formed by adding prefixes or suffixes to nouns. The most common locative prefixes are **e-** and **o-**, often used with the suffix **-ini**:

**eThekwini** (in Durban)
**ekhaya** (at home)
**eskoleni** (at school)
**emgwaqeni** (on the road)

Some nouns have irregular locative forms:

**indlu** (house) → **endlini** (in the house)
**ikhishi** (kitchen) → **ekhishini** (in the kitchen)

### Conjunctions

Zulu uses various conjunctions to connect words, phrases, and clauses. Some common conjunctions include:

- **futhi** (and, also): **Ngidla futhi ngiphuza** (I eat and I drink)
- **kodwa** (but): **Ngiyamthanda kodwa akangithandi** (I love him/her but he/she doesn’t love me)
- **ngoba** (because): **Ngiyagijima ngoba ngisheshe** (I'm running because I'm in a hurry)
- **uma** (if): **Uma lina, angizi** (If it rains, I'm not coming)
- **noma** (or): **Ufuna itiye noma ikhofi?** (Do you want tea or coffee?)

Adjectives take a prefix that corresponds to the noun class they modify:

- Class 1/2: **o-/aba-**: **umuntu omkhulu** (a big person), **abantu abakhulu** (big people)
- Class 3/4: **omu-/emi-**: **umuthi omude** (a tall tree), **imithi emide** (tall trees)
- Class 5/6: **eli-/ama-**: **ithambo elide** (a long bone), **amathambo amade** (long bones)
- Class 7/8: **esi-/ezi-**: **isitsha esikhulu** (a big dish), **izitsha ezinkulu** (big dishes)
- Class 9/10: **en-/ezin-**:
