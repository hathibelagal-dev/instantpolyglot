# Indigenous Languages Of North America

Indigenous languages of North America comprise a diverse array of language families and isolates spoken by Native American peoples across the continent. These languages exhibit a wide range of linguistic features and have complex histories of development, contact, and in many cases, decline and revitalization efforts.

## Geographic Distribution

Indigenous languages are found across North America, from Alaska and Canada in the north to Mexico in the south. Major regions include:

1. Arctic and Subarctic
2. Northwest Coast
3. Plateau
4. California
5. Great Basin
6. Southwest
7. Plains
8. Southeast
9. Northeast

Each region has its own characteristic language families and linguistic features, though there is significant overlap and interaction between regions.

## Phonology

Indigenous North American languages exhibit a wide range of phonological features. Some common characteristics include:

### Consonants

Many languages have rich consonant inventories, including:

1. Glottalized consonants: Found in languages like Lushootseed (Salishan) and Navajo (Athabaskan)
   Example: Lushootseed **ƛ̓** [tɬʼ] as in **sƛ̓al̓** [stɬʼal̩] "lake"

2. Ejective consonants: Common in Athabaskan languages
   Example: Navajo **t'** [tʼ] as in **łóó'** [ɬóːʔ] "fish"

3. Lateral consonants: Widespread across various families
   Example: Mohawk (Iroquoian) **tl** [tɬ] as in **otla'kará:ke** [otɬaʔkaˈɾaːke] "in the mud"

4. Uvular consonants: Found in many Northwest Coast languages
   Example: Kwak'wala (Wakashan) **q** [q] as in **q'asa** [qʼasa] "sea otter"

### Vowels

Vowel systems vary widely, with some languages having relatively simple systems and others more complex:

1. Nasalized vowels: Present in languages like Navajo and many Algonquian languages
   Example: Ojibwe (Algonquian) **ą** [ã] as in **mąįį** [mãjː] "wolf"

2. Vowel length distinctions: Common in many language families
   Example: Cree (Algonquian) **ā** [aː] vs. **a** [a] as in **nāpēw** [naːpeːw] "man" vs. **napew** [napew] "he sleeps"

3. Tone: Found in some languages, particularly in the Athabaskan family
   Example: Navajo has four tones: high, low, rising, and falling
   **tó** (high tone) "water" vs. **tò** (low tone) "not"

### Phonotactics

Many Indigenous North American languages have complex syllable structures and allow consonant clusters:

Example: Nuu-chah-nulth (Wakashan) **tl'aah** [tɬʼaːħ] "now" demonstrates a complex onset with a glottalized affricate.

## Morphology

Indigenous North American languages are known for their complex morphological systems, with many languages being highly polysynthetic.

### Polysynthesis

Polysynthetic languages can express in a single word what might require an entire sentence in other languages. This is achieved through extensive use of affixes and incorporation.

Example: In Inuktitut (Eskimo-Aleut), a single word can express a complex idea:
**Qasuiirsarvigssarsingitluinarputt**
qasu-iirsarvig-ssar-si-ngit-luinar-putit
tired-place.to.remove-future-find-negation-completely-2nd.person.singular.indicative
"You absolutely did not find a future resting place"

### Noun Incorporation

Many languages allow nouns to be incorporated into verbs, creating complex verb forms.

Example: In Mohawk (Iroquoian):
**Washakotya'tawenri'**
wa-shako-at-ya't-a-wenr-i'
factual-masculine.singular.agent/feminine.singular.patient-reflexive-body-linker-fall-causative
"He made her fall"

### Classificatory Verbs

Some languages, particularly in the Athabaskan family, use different verb stems depending on the properties of the object being described.

Example: In Navajo, different verbs are used for handling objects based on their shape or consistency:
- **nish'a** "I'm handling a round object"
- **nishkaah** "I'm handling a flat, flexible object"
- **nishtin** "I'm handling a long, slender, stiff object"

### Obviative and Proximate Distinctions

Some Algonquian languages make a distinction between proximate (more central to the discourse) and obviative (less central) third persons.

Example: In Cree:
**Nāpēw wāpahtam maskisin, ēkwa otēma wāpahtamiyiwa.**
nāpēw wāpaht-am maskisin, ēkwa o-tēm-a wāpaht-am-iyi-wa
man.PROX see-3SG shoe.OBV and 3POSS-dog-OBV see-3SG-OBV-3SG
"The man sees a shoe, and his dog sees it (the shoe)"

### Verbal Modes and Aspects

Many languages have complex systems of verbal modes and aspects, often expressed through affixes or stem changes.

Example: In Cherokee (Iroquoian), different prefixes indicate aspects such as completive, incompletive, and progressive:
- **ga-** (completive): **gawoniha** "He/she spoke"
- **a-** (incompletive): **awoniha** "He/she is speaking"
- **uu-** (progressive): **uuwoniha** "He/she is in the process of speaking"

## Syntax

Syntactic structures in Indigenous North American languages are diverse, but some common features include:

### Word Order

While word order varies among languages, many exhibit a tendency towards SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) or VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) order.

Example: In Navajo (Athabaskan), the basic word order is SOV:
**Ashkii at'ééd yiyiiltsa.**
ashkii at'ééd yi-yi-ił-tsa
boy girl 3SG.OBJ-3SG.SUBJ-see-PERF
"The boy saw the girl"

### Head-Marking vs. Dependent-Marking

Many Indigenous North American languages are head-marking, meaning grammatical relationships are marked on the head of a phrase rather than its dependents.

Example: In Mohawk (Iroquoian), possession is marked on the possessed noun (the head) rather than the possessor:
**rake'niha**
rake-'nih-a
1SG.PATIENT-father-NOMINAL
"my father"

### Switch-Reference

Some languages, particularly in the Southwest, use switch-reference systems to track whether the subject of a dependent clause is the same as or different from the subject of the main clause.

Example: In Kiowa (Kiowa-Tanoan):
**Háunpày nę̀ębi è kôi à.**
háun-pày nę̀-ę-bi è kô-i à
come.home-when.SS 1SG-eat-FUT and leave-FUT DECL
"When I come home, I will eat and leave"

### Evidentiality

Many languages have grammaticalized systems for indicating the source of information, known as evidentiality.

Example: In Central Pomo (Pomoan):
**mí:pal ʔa· číyáʔ k̓á:ɬay**
mí:pal ʔa· číyá-ʔ k̓á:-ɬa-y
3PL.AGENT 1SG.PATIENT see-PFCT AUX-INFERENTIAL-DECL
"They must have seen me (I infer)"

## Lexicon

The lexicons of Indigenous North American languages reflect the cultures, environments, and histories of their speakers. Some notable features include:

### Kinship Terms

Many languages have elaborate kinship terminology systems that differ significantly from those found in Indo-European languages.

Example: In Dakota (Siouan), there are distinct terms for:
- **čhuwé** "older brother (of a male)"
- **thíblo** "older brother (of a female)"
- **thųká** "younger brother (of a male)"
- **thųkášila** "younger brother (of a female)"

### Numerical Systems

Indigenous languages often have distinct numerical systems, some using base-20 or other non-decimal bases.

Example: In Yupik (Eskimo-Aleut), the number system is vigesimal (base-20):
- **yuinaat** "twenty" (literally "a person")
- **yuinaak malġuk** "forty" (literally "two twenties")

### Color Terms

Color terminology can vary significantly from Indo-European systems, with some languages having fewer basic color terms and others having more specific distinctions.

Example: In Navajo (Athabaskan), there is no single word for "blue". Instead, there are terms for different shades:
- **dootł'izh** "turquoise"
- **yágo** "sky blue"

### Directional Systems

Many languages have complex systems for expressing direction and spatial relationships, often based on geographic features or cardinal directions rather than relative positioning.

Example: In Tzeltal (Mayan), spatial relationships are expressed using an absolute frame of reference based on the slope of the local terrain:
- **alan** "downhill"
- **ajk'ol** "uphill"

### Metaphorical Extensions

Indigenous languages often use metaphorical extensions of concrete terms to express abstract concepts, reflecting cultural worldviews.

Example: In Lakhota (Siouan), the word for "heart" is used metaphorically:
- **čhaŋté** "heart"
- **čhaŋtéšiča** "sad" (literally "bad heart")
- **čhaŋtéwašte** "happy" (literally "good heart")

## Writing Systems

Many Indigenous North American languages did not have writing systems prior to European contact. However, various writing systems have been developed or adapted over time:

### Syllabaries

Several languages use syllabic writing systems, where each symbol represents a syllable.

Example: The Cherokee syllabary, developed by Sequoyah in the early 19th century:
**ᏣᎳᎩ** (tsalagi) "Cherokee"

### Latin-Based Alphabets

Many languages use adapted versions of the Latin alphabet, often with additional characters or diacritics to represent sounds not found in European languages.

Example: Navajo orthography uses several modified Latin letters:
**Diné bizaad** "Navajo language"

### Pictographic Systems

Some cultures developed pictographic systems for record-keeping or spiritual purposes, though these were not full writing systems.

Example: Ojibwe wiigwaasabak (birchbark scrolls) used pictographs to record songs, rituals, and historical events.

## Linguistic Features

Indigenous North American languages exhibit a wide range of interesting linguistic features:

### Animacy

Many languages make grammatical distinctions between animate and inanimate nouns, which can affect verb agreement, plural formation, and other aspects of grammar.

Example: In Ojibwe (Algonquian), animate nouns take different plural endings:
- **animosh** "dog" (animate) → **animoshag** "dogs"
- **waakaa'igan** "house" (inanimate) → **waakaa'iganan** "houses"

### Reduplication

Reduplication, the repetition of all or part of a word, is used in many languages for various grammatical functions.

Example: In Salish languages, reduplication is often used to indicate plurality or repetitive action:
Lushootseed (Salishan): **báʔbədiʔ** "children" (from **bádiʔ** "child")

### Honorifics and Social Deixis

Some languages have complex systems of honorifics or social deixis, where grammatical forms change based on the social relationship between speakers.

Example: In Kiksht (Chinookan), different pronouns are used depending on the gender of the speaker and the addressee:
- **naika** "I" (said by a male to a male)
- **naxa** "I" (said by a female to a female)

### Verbal Classification

Many languages, particularly in the Athabaskan family, have systems of verbal classification where verbs are categorized based on the properties of their subjects or objects.

Example: In Navajo, verbs for "give" vary depending on the type of object being given:
- **neishtį́į́h** "I'm giving (a slender flexible object)"
- **neishje** "I'm giving (a flat flexible object)"
- **neishnil** "I'm giving (a bunch or plurality)"

### Inalienable Possession

Many languages make a distinction between alienable and inalienable possession, with inalienably possessed nouns (often body parts or kinship terms) requiring a possessive prefix.

Example: In Mohawk (Iroquoian):
**ke'nihsténha** "my mother" (inalienable, always possessed)
**akwá:tshere'** "my dish" (alienable, can be unpossessed)

## Language Contact and Change

Indigenous North American languages have been influenced by contact with each other and with European languages:

### Sprachbunds

Areas of linguistic convergence, known as sprachbunds, have developed where languages of different families have influenced each other.

Example: The Pacific Northwest sprachbund includes languages from several families (Salishan, Wakashan, Chimakuan) that have developed similar features such as glottalized consonants and elaborate consonant clusters.

### Loanwords

Languages have borrowed words from each other and from European languages, particularly for new concepts or technologies.

Example: Many Algonquian languages have borrowed the word for "bread":
Ojibwe: **bakwezhigan** (from French "baguette")

### Code-Switching and Mixed Languages

In some communities, extensive language contact has led to frequent code-switching or the development of mixed languages.

Example: Michif, a mixed language combining Cree (Algonquian) verbs with French nouns:
**Li vyeu om ki:nikamow.**
li vyeu om ki:-nikamo-w
DEF old man PAST-sing-3SG
"The old man sang."

### Pidgins and Trade Languages

Several pidgins and trade languages developed to facilitate communication between different Indigenous groups and with European traders.

Example: Chinook Jargon, a trade language of the Pacific Northwest:
**Klahowya, nika nem John.**
klahowya nika nem John
hello 1SG name John
"Hello, my name is John."

## Endangered Languages and Revitalization Efforts

Many Indigenous North American languages are critically endangered due to historical policies of forced assimilation, economic pressures, and the dominance of English and Spanish.

### Language Status

Languages can be classified based on their level of endangerment:

1. Healthy: Languages still being learned by children as a first language
   Example: Navajo (Diné bizaad) - approximately 170,000 speakers

2. Endangered: Languages with a decreasing number of speakers, often not being learned by children
   Example: Lakota - approximately 2,000 speakers

3. Critically Endangered: Languages with only a handful of elderly speakers
   Example: Mandan - fewer than 10 speakers

4. Dormant: Languages with no living speakers but with community members working to revive them
   Example: Wampanoag - last native speaker died in 1908, but revitalization efforts are ongoing

### Revitalization Strategies

Various strategies are being employed to revitalize endangered languages:

1. Immersion Programs: Schools where the endangered language is used as the medium of instruction
   Example: Ojibwe immersion schools in Minnesota and Wisconsin

2. Master-Apprentice Programs: Pairing fluent elders with younger learners for one-on-one language transmission
   Example: The Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival's Master-Apprentice Program

3. Documentation: Recording and analyzing languages to create resources for future learners
   Example: The Documenting Endangered Languages program funded by the National Science Foundation

4. Technology: Developing language learning apps, online dictionaries, and other digital resources
   Example: FirstVoices, an online platform for Indigenous language archiving and learning

5. Policy Changes: Official recognition and support for Indigenous languages at various governmental levels
   Example: The Native American Languages Act of 1990 in the United States

## Linguistic Typology

Indigenous North American languages exhibit a wide range of typological features:

### Morphological Typology

1. Polysynthetic: Many languages, especially in the Arctic and Subarctic, are highly polysynthetic
   Example: Yupik (Eskimo-Aleut)
   **Tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq**
   tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq
   reindeer-hunt-FUT-say-NEG-again-3SG.INDIC
   "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer."

2. Agglutinative: Some languages use a high number of distinct, separable affixes
   Example: Cree (Algonquian)
   **nikî-nitawi-kîsiso-nânaw**
   ni-kî-nitawi-kîsiso-nânaw
   1-PAST-go.to-cook-1PL.EXCL
   "We (excl.) went to cook."

3. Fusional: Some languages, particularly in the Southeast, show more fusional characteristics
   Example: Cherokee (Iroquoian) verb forms often fuse multiple grammatical categories

### Syntactic Typology

1. Head-Marking: Many languages mark grammatical relations on the head of a phrase rather than its dependents
   Example: In Navajo (Athabaskan), possession is marked on the possessed noun:
   **shichidí** "my car" (shi- "my" + chidí "car")

2. Verb-Final: Many languages, especially in western North America, have SOV word order
   Example: Quechan (Yuman)
   **'anyá 'axwétt nyakwék**
   'anyá 'axwétt nya-kwé-k
   I bread 1SG.OBJ-eat-REAL
   "I ate bread."

3. Verb-Initial: Some languages, particularly in Mesoamerica, have VSO word order
   Example: Mixtec (Oto-Manguean)
   **Ni-xini Juan ñá'a**
   COMPL-see Juan woman
   "Juan saw the woman."

### Phonological Typology

1. Large Consonant Inventories: Many languages have extensive consonant systems
   Example: Ubykh (extinct Northwest Caucasian language formerly spoken in North America) had 84 consonant phonemes

2. Tone: Some languages use phonemic tone
   Example: Navajo (Athabaskan) has four tones: high, low, rising, and falling
   **tó** (high tone) "water" vs. **tò** (low tone) "not"

3. Vowel Harmony: Some languages exhibit vowel harmony
   Example: Wichita (Caddoan)
   **kiyaːriːs** "I am good" vs. **kiyoːroːs** "you are good"

## Unique Linguistic Features

Indigenous North American languages often have grammatical categories or distinctions not commonly found in European languages:

### Clusivity

Many languages distinguish between inclusive and exclusive first person plural pronouns.

Example: In Quechua (not indigenous to North America, but illustrative of the feature):
**ñuqanchik** "we (inclusive, including the addressee)"
**ñuqayku** "we (exclusive, not including the addressee)"

### Positional Verbs

Some languages use different verbs to describe the position or stance of objects.

Example: In Tzeltal (Mayan):
**waxal** "standing (for a bottle)"
**pachal** "sitting (for a bowl)"
**telel** "lying on its side (for a log)"

### Directionals

Many languages have complex systems of directionals that can be affixed to verbs.

Example: In Hopi (Uto-Aztecan):
**angwa** "go home"
**angwlawu** "go home from here"
**angwva** "go home from there"

### Verbal Number

Some languages mark number (singular, dual, plural) on verbs in addition to or instead of nouns.

Example: In Ahtna (Athabaskan):
**yaaxi** "he/she is walking"
**'aaxi** "two people are walking"
**daaxi** "several people are walking"

### Noun Incorporation

Many languages allow nouns to be incorporated into verb complexes.

Example: In Mohawk (Iroquoian):
**Wa'kenaktahnínu**
wa'-ke-nakt-a-hnínu-'
FACT-1SG.AGENT-bed-LINK-buy-PUNCT
"I bought a bed"

### Obviation

Some Algonquian languages use a system of obviation to distinguish between multiple third-person referents.

Example: In Cree:
**Nāpēw wāpahtam maskisin, ēkwa otēma wāpahtamiyiwa.**
nāpēw wāpaht-am maskisin, ēkwa o-tēm-a wāpaht-am-iyi-wa
man.PROX see-3SG shoe.OBV and 3POSS-dog-OBV see-3SG-OBV-3SG
"The man (proximate) sees a shoe (obviative), and his dog (obviative) sees it (the shoe, obviative)"

## Semantic Domains

Indigenous North American languages often have rich vocabularies in certain semantic domains, reflecting the cultures and environments of their speakers:

### Kinship Terms

Many languages have elaborate kinship systems with terms that make distinctions not found in English.

Example: In Dakota (Siouan):
**čhuwé** "older brother (of a male)"
**thųká** "younger brother (of a male)"
**thąká** "older sister (of a male)"
**thąkší** "younger sister (of a male)"

### Plant and Animal Names

Languages often have highly specific terms for local flora and fauna.

Example: In Halkomelem (Salishan), there are many specific terms for salmon:
**sth'óqwi** "coho salmon"
**kw'ó:lexw** "chum salmon"
**théxeth** "pink salmon"

### Snow and Ice Terminology

Arctic languages are famous for their numerous terms describing different types of snow and ice.

Example: In Inuktitut (Eskimo-Aleut):
**qanuk** "falling snow"
**aput** "snow on the ground"
**piqtaq** "blowing snow"

### Spatial Relations

Many languages have complex systems for describing spatial relations, often based on absolute rather than relative frames of reference.

Example: In Tzeltal (Mayan), spatial relations are expressed using an absolute frame of reference based on the slope of the local terrain:
**alan** "downhill"
**ajk'ol** "uphill"

These examples illustrate the rich diversity and complexity of Indigenous North American languages, showcasing their unique features and the ways in which they reflect the cultures and worldviews of their speakers. The study and preservation of these languages not only contributes to our understanding of human language capacity but also helps maintain the cultural heritage of Indigenous communities.
