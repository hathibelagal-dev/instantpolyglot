# Greenlandic

Greenlandic (Kalaallisut: **Kalaallisut**) is an Eskimo-Aleut language spoken by approximately 56,000 people in Greenland. It is the official language of Greenland and is closely related to other Inuit languages spoken in Canada and Alaska. Greenlandic is known for its complex morphology and polysynthetic structure, making it a fascinating subject for linguistic study.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Greenlandic has a relatively simple consonant inventory:

| Manner | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| Stop   | p      | t        |         | k     | q      |
| Nasal  | m      | n        |         | ŋ     |        |
| Fricative | v [f~v] | s     | j [j]   |       | r [ʁ]  |
| Lateral |        | l        |         |       |        |

Some notes on consonant pronunciation:

- /v/ is typically realized as [f] at the beginning of words and [v] elsewhere.
- /r/ is a uvular fricative [ʁ], similar to the French 'r'.
- /q/ is a uvular stop, distinct from the velar /k/.
- /ŋ/ is a velar nasal, written as 'ng' in the orthography.

### Vowels

Greenlandic has three vowel phonemes:

| Front | Back |
|-------|------|
| i     | u    |
|       | a    |

Vowel length is phonemic, with each vowel having a short and long version. Long vowels are written double in the orthography:

- Short: **i**, **u**, **a**
- Long: **ii**, **uu**, **aa**

Examples:
- **ila** [ila] ('part') vs. **ilaaq** [ilaːq] ('relative')
- **nuna** [nuna] ('land') vs. **nuuna** [nuːna] ('to taste good')

### Phonological processes

1. Assimilation: Consonants often assimilate to the place of articulation of following consonants.
   Examples:
   - **illu** + **-kkut** → **illukkut** ('through the house')
   - **inuk** + **-mut** → **inummut** ('to the person')

2. Consonant gemination: Consonants can be lengthened for emphasis or grammatical reasons.
   Examples:
   - **nuna** ('land') → **nunna** ('big land')
   - **imaq** ('sea') → **immaq** ('big sea')

3. Vowel coalescence: When two vowels come together across morpheme boundaries, they often merge into a single long vowel.
   Examples:
   - **nuna** + **-i** → **nunaa** ('his/her land')
   - **inu** + **-u-** → **inuu-** ('to be a person')

4. Uvularization: The uvular consonant **q** can affect neighboring vowels, changing their quality.
   Examples:
   - **qaqqaq** [qɑχχɑq] ('mountain')
   - **qimmeq** [qemːεq] ('dog')

5. Vowel harmony: In some dialects, particularly East Greenlandic, there is a system of vowel harmony where /i/ and /u/ cannot occur in the same word. This is not present in standard West Greenlandic.

6. Consonant clusters: Greenlandic allows for complex consonant clusters, particularly at morpheme boundaries.
   Example: **anguteeraq** [aŋutεːʁaq] ('little man')

## Morphology

Greenlandic is a highly polysynthetic language, meaning that a single word can express what would require an entire sentence in many other languages. Words are built by adding numerous suffixes to a root. This section will explore the complex morphological system of Greenlandic.

### Nouns

Nouns in Greenlandic are inflected for case and possession. There are eight cases:

1. Absolutive (ABS)
2. Relative (REL)
3. Instrumental (INS)
4. Allative (ALL)
5. Locative (LOC)
6. Ablative (ABL)
7. Prosecutive (PRO)
8. Equative (EQU)

Example of case declension for **illu** ('house'):

| Case | Singular | Plural | Usage |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| ABS  | **illu** | **illut** | Subject of intransitive verb, object of transitive verb |
| REL  | **illup** | **illut** | Subject of transitive verb, possessor |
| INS  | **illumik** | **illunik** | Instrument, means |
| ALL  | **illumut** | **illunut** | Motion towards |
| LOC  | **illumi** | **illuni** | Location |
| ABL  | **illumit** | **illunit** | Motion away from |
| PRO  | **illukkut** | **illukkoortut** | Motion through |
| EQU  | **illutut** | **illutut** | Comparison |

Examples of case usage:

1. Absolutive: **Illu angisooq.** ('The house is big.')
2. Relative: **Illup qalia qernerpoq.** ('The house's roof is black.')
3. Instrumental: **Illumik takunnittunga.** ('I see a house.')
4. Allative: **Illumut ingerlappunga.** ('I'm going to the house.')
5. Locative: **Illumi najugaqarpunga.** ('I live in the house.')
6. Ablative: **Illumit anivunga.** ('I'm coming out of the house.')
7. Prosecutive: **Illukkut ingerlavunga.** ('I'm going through the house.')
8. Equative: **Illutut angitigivoq.** ('It's as big as a house.')

Possession is indicated by adding possessive suffixes to the noun. These suffixes agree with the person and number of the possessor:

| Possessor | Singular possessed | Plural possessed |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1SG       | **illuga** (my house) | **illukka** (my houses) |
| 2SG       | **illut** (your house) | **illutit** (your houses) |
| 3SG       | **illua** (his/her house) | **illui** (his/her houses) |
| 1PL       | **illuput** (our house) | **illuput** (our houses) |
| 2PL       | **illursi** (your house) | **illusi** (your houses) |
| 3PL       | **illuat** (their house) | **illui** (their houses) |

Examples of possessed nouns in sentences:

1. **Illuga qaqortuuvoq.** ('My house is white.')
2. **Illumi najugaqarputit?** ('Do you live in your house?')
3. **Arnap illuni asavaa.** ('The woman loves her house.')

### Verbs

Greenlandic verbs are highly complex, incorporating information about subject, object, tense, mood, and various other aspects. Verbs can be intransitive (with only a subject) or transitive (with both subject and object).

#### Mood

Greenlandic has several moods, including:

1. Indicative: Used for stating facts
2. Interrogative: Used for questions
3. Imperative: Used for commands
4. Optative: Used for wishes or hopes
5. Causative: Used to indicate causation
6. Conditional: Used for hypothetical situations
7. Contemporative: Used for simultaneous actions
8. Participial: Used for subordinate clauses

Example of mood inflection for the verb **neri-** ('to eat'):

| Mood | Form | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| Indicative | **nerivunga** | I eat |
| Interrogative | **nerivinga** | Do I eat? |
| Imperative | **nerigi** | Eat! |
| Optative | **nerigit** | May you eat |
| Causative | **nerippara** | I make him/her eat |
| Conditional | **neriguma** | If I eat |
| Contemporative | **nerillunga** | While I eat |
| Participial | **nerileq** | The one who eats |

Examples of mood usage in sentences:

1. Indicative: **Nerivunga ullaanut.** ('I eat breakfast.')
2. Interrogative: **Sunik nerivit?** ('What are you eating?')
3. Imperative: **Nerigi maanna!** ('Eat now!')
4. Optative: **Nerigit peqqissumik.** ('May you eat healthily.')
5. Causative: **Meeraq nerippara.** ('I make the child eat.')
6. Conditional: **Neriguma neriuutigaara.** ('If I eat, I hope.')
7. Contemporative: **Nerillunga atuarpunga.** ('While eating, I read.')
8. Participial: **Nerileq takuara.** ('I see the one who is eating.')

#### Tense and Aspect

Greenlandic does not have a strict tense system like many European languages. Instead, it uses a combination of mood and aspect markers to indicate time relationships. Some common aspectual suffixes include:

- **-ler-**: Inchoative (beginning of an action)
- **-sima-**: Perfect (completed action)
- **-tar-**: Habitual (recurring action)
- **-ssa-**: Future (intended or expected action)

Examples:
- **nerilerpoq** ('he/she starts to eat')
- **nerisimavunga** ('I have eaten')
- **neritarpoq** ('he/she eats regularly')
- **nerissaaq** ('he/she will eat')

Combined examples:
- **Nerilersimavunga.** ('I have started to eat.')
- **Neritassimassaaq.** ('He/she will probably have eaten.')

#### Person and Number

Verbs agree with their subject (and object, if transitive) in person and number. Here's an example of intransitive verb inflection for **sinip-** ('to sleep') in the indicative mood:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **sinippunga** | **sinippugut** |
| 2 | **sinipputit** | **sinippusi** |
| 3 | **sinippoq** | **sinipput** |

Examples in sentences:
1. **Sinippunga arfineq-pingasut tiimit.** ('I sleep for eight hours.')
2. **Sinipputit sivisuumik?** ('Do you sleep for a long time?')
3. **Meeqqat sinipput.** ('The children are sleeping.')

For transitive verbs, the inflection includes information about both subject and object. Here's an example with **taku-** ('to see'):

| Subject | Object | Form | Meaning |
|---------|--------|------|---------|
| 1SG | 3SG | **takuara** | I see him/her/it |
| 2SG | 1SG | **takuvanga** | You see me |
| 3SG | 2PL | **takuvaasi** | He/she sees you (pl.) |
| 1PL | 3PL | **takuavut** | We see them |
| 2PL | 3SG | **takuvarsi** | You (pl.) see him/her/it |
| 3PL | 1SG | **takuvaannga** | They see me |

Examples in sentences:
1. **Puisi takuara.** ('I see a seal.')
2. **Takuvanga atuarfimmi.** ('You see me at school.')
3. **Ilissi tamaasi takuvaasi.** ('He/she sees all of you.')

### Derivational Morphology

Greenlandic has a rich system of derivational suffixes that can change the meaning or part of speech of a word. Some examples:

- **-sior-**: 'to seek, look for'
  **aalisagaq** ('fish') → **aalisagar-sior-** ('to fish')

- **-lior-**: 'to make, produce'
  **illu** ('house') → **illu-lior-** ('to build a house')

- **-u-**: 'to be (noun)'
  **angut** ('man') → **angut-u-voq** ('he is a man')

- **-nngit-**: Negation
  **neri-** ('to eat') → **neri-nngit-** ('to not eat')

- **-galuar-**: 'although'
  **tikip-** ('to arrive') → **tiki-galuar-** ('although arrive')

- **-kasik**: Pejorative
  **angut** ('man') → **angu-kasik** ('damn man')

- **-suaq**: Augmentative
  **qimmeq** ('dog') → **qimme-suaq** ('big dog')

- **-araq**: Diminutive
  **nanoq** ('polar bear') → **nano-araq** ('small polar bear')

Examples in sentences:
1. **Ullumi aalisagarsiorpugut.** ('Today we are fishing.')
2. **Illuliortut sulivoq.** ('The house builder is working.')
3. **Angutuvoq 30-nik ukiulik.** ('He is a 30-year-old man.')
4. **Ullumi nerinngillanga.** ('Today I'm not eating.')
5. **Tikigaluarpoq kisianni uninngaannarpoq.** ('Although he arrived, he just stayed.')
6. **Angukasik oqaaseqanngilaq.** ('The damn man doesn’t say anything.')
7. **Qimmesuaq takuiuk?** ('Did you see the big dog?')
8. **Nanoaraq alianaatsuuvoq.** ('The small polar bear is cute.')

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Greenlandic is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), but due to its rich morphology, word order can be quite flexible. The most important information often comes at the end of the sentence.

Example:
**Piitap puisi takuaa.**
Piita-p puisi taku-vaa
Peter-REL seal.ABS see-IND.3SG.3SG
'Peter sees the seal.'

Other possible word orders:
- **Puisi Piitap takuaa.** (OSV)
- **Takuaa Piitap puisi.** (VOS)

The flexibility in word order is often used for emphasis or focus:

1. **Piitap puisi takuaa.** (neutral statement)
2. **Puisi Piitap takuaa.** (emphasis on 'seal')
3. **Takuaa Piitap puisi.** (emphasis on the act of seeing)

### Ergativity

Greenlandic exhibits ergative-absolutive alignment. This means that the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are marked the same way (absolutive case), while the subject of a transitive verb is marked differently (relative case).

Example:
1. **Arnaq sinippoq.** ('The woman sleeps.')
   arnaq sinip-poq
   woman.ABS sleep-IND.3SG

2. **Arnap nanoq takuaa.** ('The woman sees the bear.')
   arna-p nanoq taku-vaa
   woman-REL bear.ABS see-IND.3SG.3SG

3. **Nanoq nikuippoq.** ('The bear stands up.')
   nanoq nikuip-poq
   bear.ABS stand_up-IND.3SG

In these examples, we can see that 'woman' in sentence 1 (intransitive subject) and 'bear' in sentence 2 (transitive object) are both in the absolutive case, while 'woman' in sentence 2 (transitive subject) is in the relative case.

This ergative-absolutive system extends to pronouns as well:

- **Sinippunga.** ('I sleep.' - absolutive)
- **Takuakkit.** ('I see you.' - ergative subject, absolutive object)

### Antipassive Construction

Greenlandic has an antipassive construction that allows a transitive verb to be used intransitively. This is done by adding the suffix **-si-** to the verb and putting the object in the instrumental case.

Example:
1. Transitive: **Arnap puisi takuaa.** ('The woman sees the seal.')
   arna-p puisi taku-vaa
   woman-REL seal.ABS see-IND.3SG.3SG

2. Antipassive: **Arnaq puisimik takusivoq.** ('The woman seal-sees.')
   arnaq puisi-mik taku-si-voq
   woman.ABS seal-INS see-ANTIPASS-IND.3SG

The antipassive construction is often used when the object is indefinite or less important to the action.

### Incorporation

Noun incorporation is common in Greenlandic, where a noun can be incorporated into the verb to create a new verbal meaning. This process often involves the object of a transitive verb being incorporated into the verb, creating an intransitive verb.

Examples:
1. **Kaffisorpoq.** ('He/she drinks coffee.')
   kaffi-sor-poq
   coffee-drink-IND.3SG

2. **Aallaaniarpunga.** ('I'm going to hunt.')
   aallaat-niar-punga
   gun-use.for.hunting-IND.1SG

3. **Qimmeqarpoq.** ('He/she has a dog.')
   qimmeq-qar-poq
   dog-have-IND.3SG

Incorporation can also involve more complex structures:

4. **Angutisiuiniarpunga.** ('I'm going to look for a husband.')
   anguti-siu-i-niar-punga
   man-seek-ANTIPASS-intend-IND.1SG

### Subordination

Subordinate clauses in Greenlandic are often expressed through verbal moods rather than separate clauses. This section will explore various types of subordination.

1. Contemporative Mood:
   Used for 'when' or 'while' clauses:

   **Nerillunga atuarpunga.**
   neri-llunga atuar-punga
   eat-CONT.1SG read-IND.1SG
   'While eating, I read.'

2. Conditional Mood:
   Used for 'if' clauses:

   **Siallerpat anissanngilanga.**
   sialler-pat ani-ssa-nngi-langa
   rain-COND.3SG go_out-FUT-NEG-IND.1SG
   'If it rains, I won’t go out.'

3. Causative Mood:
   Used for 'because' clauses:

   **Nerisuugama kaanngilanga.**
   neri-suu-gama kaa-nngi-langa
   eat-HAB-CAUS.1SG be_hungry-NEG-IND.1SG
   'Because I ate, I'm not hungry.'

4. Participial Mood:
   Used for relative clauses:

   **Inuk takulleq ilisarisimaviuk?**
   inuk taku-lleq ilisarisima-viuk
   person.ABS see-PART.ABS know-INTERR.2SG.3SG
   'Do you know the person who was seen?'

5. Infinitive:
   Used for purpose clauses:

   **Atuariartorpunga.**
   atuar-iar-tor-punga
   read-go_to-purpose-IND.1SG
   'I'm going to read.'

### Negation

Negation in Greenlandic is typically expressed through the suffix **-nngit-**, which is added to the verb stem before the mood and person markers.

Examples:
1. **Sininngilanga.** ('I'm not sleeping.')
   sinip-nngit-langa
   sleep-NEG-IND.1SG

2. **Puisinik takunngilanga.** ('I don’t see any seals.')
   puisi-nik taku-nngit-langa
   seal-INS.PL see-NEG-IND.1SG

3. **Oqalussinnaanngilaq.** ('He/she can’t speak.')
   oqaluk-sinnaa-nngit-laq
   speak-can-NEG-IND.3SG

### Questions

Questions in Greenlandic can be formed in two ways:

1. Using the interrogative mood:
   **Suminngaanniit aggerpisi?**
   su-minngaanniit agge-rpisi
   where-ABL come-INTERR.2PL
   'Where are you coming from?'

2. Using question words with the indicative mood:
   **Suna nerivit?**
   suna neri-vit
   what.ABS eat-IND.2SG
   'What are you eating?'

Common question words include:
- **kina** ('who')
- **suna** ('what')
- **sumi** ('where')
- **qanga** ('when')
- **qanoq** ('how')
- **sooq** ('why')

Example:
**Kina takulleq ilisarisimaviuk?**
kina taku-lleq ilisarisima-viuk
who.ABS see-PART.ABS know-INTERR.2SG.3SG
'Who is the person you saw?'

## Vocabulary

- **biili**: car (from Danish 'bil')
- **kaffi**: coffee (from Danish 'kaffe')
- **siornatigut**: computer (literally 'like the past', a neologism for modern technology)
- **atuagaq**: book (native Greenlandic word, but influenced by Danish 'bog')

### Semantic Fields

Greenlandic has rich vocabulary in certain semantic fields, reflecting the culture and environment of its speakers. For example:

1. Snow and Ice:
   - **aput**: snow on the ground
   - **qaniit**: falling snow
   - **pukak**: crystalline snow on the ground
   - **aniu**: packed snow
   - **siku**: ice
   - **sikuaq**: thin ice

2. Hunting and Fishing:
   - **aallaaniarpunga**: I'm going hunting
   - **qisuttarpunga**: I'm gathering firewood
   - **aalisarpunga**: I'm fishing
   - **piniarpunga**: I'm hunting/gathering

3. Family Relations:
   - **ataata**: father
   - **anaana**: mother
   - **atak**: paternal uncle
   - **aja**: maternal aunt
   - **angak**: maternal uncle
   - **saki**: sibling-in-law

This rich vocabulary in certain areas demonstrates how language reflects the lifestyle and environment of its speakers.

## Dialects

There are three main dialects of Greenlandic:

1. West Greenlandic (Kalaallisut): The standard form and most widely spoken dialect. It is spoken by about 44,000 people and is the basis for written Greenlandic.

2. East Greenlandic (Tunumiisut): Spoken on the east coast of Greenland by about 3,000 people. It has retained some phonological features lost in West Greenlandic.

3. North Greenlandic (Inuktun): Spoken in the northwest of Greenland by about 1,000 people. It is closer to the Inuktitut dialects of Canada than to standard Greenlandic.

The dialects differ in pronunciation, vocabulary, and to some extent, grammar. For example:

- East Greenlandic has retained the consonant /s/ in certain positions where West Greenlandic has /h/.
  Example: WG **sila** vs. EG **sela** ('weather')

- North Greenlandic has a different system of demonstratives and some unique vocabulary items.
  Example: NG **uanga** vs. WG **uanga** ('I', but with different pronunciations)

- Vocabulary differences:
  'house': WG **illu**, EG **itte**, NG **iglu**

Despite these differences, the dialects are generally mutually intelligible, although speakers may need some time to adjust when communicating across dialects.

## Writing System

Greenlandic uses a Latin alphabet with some additional letters:

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, Æ, Ø, Å

The letters C, D, H, W, X, Y, and Z are only used in loanwords. The letter E is rare in native words.

Some digraphs are used to represent specific sounds:

- **ng**: [ŋ] (velar nasal)
- **ll**: [ɬ] (voiceless alveolar lateral fricative, in some dialects)

The current orthography was introduced in 1973 and is based on the West Greenlandic dialect. It replaced an earlier system that used many diacritical marks.

Spelling rules in Greenlandic are generally phonemic, meaning that words are spelled as they are pronounced. However, there are some morphophonemic alternations that are not reflected in the spelling, such as consonant assimilation at morpheme boundaries.

Example text in Greenlandic:

**Inuit tamarmik inunngorput nammineersinnaassuseqarlutik assigiimmillu ataqqinassuseqarlutillu pisinnaatitaaffeqarlutik. Silaqassusermik tarnillu nalunngissusianik pilersugaapput, imminnullu iliorfigeqatigiittariaqaraluarput qatanngutigiittut peqatigiinnerup anersaavani.**

This is the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Greenlandic. A rough translation:

“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”

This example showcases many features of Greenlandic, including its agglutinative nature, incorporation, and complex morphology.
