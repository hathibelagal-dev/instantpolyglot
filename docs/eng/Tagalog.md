# Tagalog

Tagalog is an Austronesian language spoken by about 28 million people as a first language, primarily in the Philippines. It serves as the basis for Filipino, the national language of the Philippines. Tagalog is closely related to other Philippine languages such as Cebuano, Ilocano, and Hiligaynon, and more distantly to other Austronesian languages like Indonesian and Malay.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Tagalog uses the Latin alphabet, with 28 letters: the 26 letters of the English alphabet plus the Spanish Ñ and the Ng digraph, which is considered a single letter in Tagalog. The pronunciation is generally regular, with a few exceptions.

### Vowels

Tagalog has five vowel phonemes:

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
**a** | [a]
**e** | [ɛ]
**i** | [i]
**o** | [o]
**u** | [u]

In some dialects and in rapid speech, **i** and **e** may be pronounced as [ɪ], while **u** and **o** may be pronounced as [ʊ].

### Consonants

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
**b** | [b]
**k** | [k]
**d** | [d]
**g** | [ɡ]
**h** | [h]
**l** | [l]
**m** | [m]
**n** | [n]
**ng** | [ŋ]
**ñ** | [ɲ]
**p** | [p]
**r** | [ɾ]
**s** | [s]
**t** | [t]
**w** | [w]
**y** | [j]

The following consonants are only used in loanwords:

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
**c** | [k] or [s]
**f** | [f]
**j** | [dʒ] or [h]
**q** | [k]
**v** | [b] or [v]
**x** | [ks]
**z** | [z]

### Stress

Stress in Tagalog is phonemic, meaning it can change the meaning of words. Generally, stress falls on either the last syllable (oxytone) or the second-to-last syllable (paroxytone) of a word. For example:

- **bá.sa** [ˈba.sa] (read)
- **ba.sá** [ba.ˈsa] (wet)

### Glottal stop

The glottal stop [ʔ] is an important feature in Tagalog pronunciation, although it's not represented in the standard orthography. It often occurs:

1. Between two vowels: **paa** [pa.ʔa] (foot)
2. At the end of words ending in a vowel: **oo** [o.ʔo] (yes)
3. Before word-initial vowels: **aso** [ʔa.so] (dog)

## Morphology

Tagalog morphology is characterized by its use of affixes (prefixes, infixes, and suffixes) to modify the meaning and function of root words. This system allows for the creation of a wide variety of words from a single root.

### Nouns

Nouns in Tagalog are generally unmarked for number or gender. Plurality can be indicated by the use of numbers, quantifiers, or the plural marker **mga** [maŋa]:

- **aso** (dog/dogs)
- **mga aso** (dogs)

Personal names are marked with the particle **si** for singular and **sina** for plural:

- **si Juan** (Juan)
- **sina Juan at Maria** (Juan and Maria)

Common nouns are marked with the particle **ang** (definite) or **ng** [naŋ] (indefinite):

- **ang bahay** (the house)
- **ng bahay** (of a house)

### Pronouns

Tagalog pronouns are marked for person, number, and case. There are three cases: absolutive (ABS), ergative (ERG), and oblique (OBL).

| Person | ABS | ERG | OBL |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|
1SG | **ako** | **ko** | **akin**
2SG | **ikaw**/**ka** | **mo** | **iyo**
3SG | **siya** | **niya** | **kanya**
1PL.INCL | **tayo** | **natin** | **atin**
1PL.EXCL | **kami** | **namin** | **amin**
2PL | **kayo** | **ninyo** | **inyo**
3PL | **sila** | **nila** | **kanila**

Examples:

- **Kumain ako.** (I ate.)
- **Kinain ko ang mangga.** (I ate the mango.)
- **Para sa akin ang regalo.** (The gift is for me.)

### Verbs

Tagalog verbs are highly complex, with a rich system of affixes that indicate aspect, mood, and focus. The focus system is a key feature of Tagalog grammar, where the verb morphology indicates which argument in the sentence is the topic.

#### Aspect

Tagalog verbs have four aspects:

1. Infinitive/Contemplated (INF): action not yet begun
2. Imperfective (IMPF): ongoing or habitual action
3. Perfective (PFV): completed action
4. Recently Completed (RC): just completed action

These aspects are marked by different affixes, which vary depending on the verb class. Here's an example with the verb **kain** (eat):

| Aspect | Form | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
INF | **kumain** | **Gusto kong kumain.** (I want to eat.)
IMPF | **kumakain** | **Kumakain ako.** (I am eating.)
PFV | **kumain** | **Kumain na ako.** (I already ate.)
RC | **kakakain** | **Kakakain ko lang.** (I just ate.)

#### Focus

Tagalog verbs can take different focuses, indicating which argument in the sentence is the topic. The main focuses are:

1. Actor Focus (AF)
2. Object Focus (OF)
3. Locative Focus (LF)
4. Benefactive Focus (BF)
5. Instrumental Focus (IF)

Each focus is marked by different affixes. Here's an example with the root **bili** (buy):

| Focus | INF | IMPF | PFV | RC |
|-------|-----|------|-----|------|
AF | **bumili** | **bumibili** | **bumili** | **kababili**
OF | **bilhin** | **binibili** | **binili** | **kababili**
LF | **bilhan** | **binibilhan** | **binilhan** | **kabilhan**
BF | **ibili** | **ibinibili** | **ibinili** | **kaibibili**
IF | **ipambili** | **ipinambibili** | **ipinambili** | **kaipambibili**

Examples:

- AF: **Bumili ako ng tinapay.** (I bought bread.)
- OF: **Binili ko ang tinapay.** (I bought the bread.)
- LF: **Binilhan ko ng tinapay ang tindahan.** (I bought bread from the store.)
- BF: **Ibinili kita ng tinapay.** (I bought bread for you.)
- IF: **Ipinambili ko ng tinapay ang pera.** (I used the money to buy bread.)

### Adjectives

Tagalog adjectives can be used attributively or predicatively. When used attributively, they are linked to the noun with the linker **na** (or **-ng** if the word ends in a vowel):

- **magandang bahay** (beautiful house)
- **mataas na puno** (tall tree)

Predicative adjectives use the same particles as nouns:

- **Maganda ang bahay.** (The house is beautiful.)
- **Matalino si Juan.** (Juan is intelligent.)

Comparison is expressed using the words **mas** (more), **higit** (greater), **pinaka-** (most), and **kaysa** (than):

- **mas maganda** (more beautiful)
- **pinakamataas** (tallest)
- **Mas maganda siya kaysa sa akin.** (She is more beautiful than me.)

### Adverbs

Many Tagalog adverbs are formed by reduplicating adjectives:

- **mabilis** (fast) → **mabilis-mabilis** (quickly)
- **tahimik** (quiet) → **tahimik-tahimik** (quietly)

Other common adverbs include:

- **kahapon** (yesterday)
- **bukas** (tomorrow)
- **kanina** (earlier)
- **mamaya** (later)
- **madalas** (often)
- **minsan** (sometimes)

## Syntax

Tagalog syntax is characterized by its verb-initial word order and its use of particles to mark the roles of noun phrases in a sentence.

### Basic word order

The basic word order in Tagalog is Verb-Subject-Object (VSO), although Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) is also common, especially in colloquial speech. The choice often depends on which element is being emphasized:

- VSO: **Bumili ang babae ng libro.** (The woman bought a book.)
- SVO: **Ang babae ay bumili ng libro.** (The woman bought a book.)

### Markers and particles

Tagalog uses various markers and particles to indicate the syntactic role of noun phrases:

- **ang**: marks the topic of the sentence
- **ng** [naŋ]: marks the direct object or agent
- **sa**: marks location, direction, or indirect object
- **ni**: marks the possessor (for personal names)
- **kay**: marks the indirect object (for personal names)

Examples:

- **Binigay ng lalaki ang libro sa babae.** (The man gave the book to the woman.)
- **Binili ni Juan ang kotse para kay Maria.** (Juan bought the car for Maria.)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the particle **ba** after the first word or phrase in the sentence:

- **Kumain ka na ba?** (Have you eaten already?)
- **Maganda ba ang pelikula?** (Is the movie good?)

Wh-questions use interrogative words such as:

- **ano** (what)
- **sino** (who)
- **kailan** (when)
- **saan** (where)
- **bakit** (why)
- **paano** (how)

Examples:

- **Ano ang pangalan mo?** (What is your name?)
- **Saan ka nakatira?** (Where do you live?)

### Negation

Negation is expressed using **hindi** for most verbs and adjectives, and **wala** for existential sentences:

- **Hindi ako kumain.** (I didn't eat.)
- **Hindi maganda ang pelikula.** (The movie isn't good.)
- **Wala akong pera.** (I don't have money.)

### Existential sentences

Existential sentences use the words **may** (there is/are) or **wala** (there isn't/aren't):

- **May tubig sa baso.** (There is water in the glass.)
- **Walang tao sa bahay.** (There is no one in the house.)

### Equational sentences

Equational sentences (A is B) don't use a copula in Tagalog:

- **Guro si Maria.** (Maria is a teacher.)
- **Maganda ang bulaklak.** (The flower is beautiful.)

## Vocabulary

Tagalog vocabulary has been influenced by various languages throughout its history, reflecting the cultural and linguistic interactions of the Philippines. Some common sources of loanwords include:

1. Spanish: due to over three centuries of Spanish colonial rule
   Examples: **eskwela** (school), **kusina** (kitchen), **silya** (chair)

2. English: due to American influence and globalization
   Examples: **kompyuter** (computer), **tren** (train), **dyip** (jeep)

3. Chinese (various dialects): due to historical trade and immigration
   Examples: **pansit** (noodles), **susi** (key), **bakya** (wooden clogs)

4. Sanskrit and other Indian languages: through early trade and cultural exchange
   Examples: **guro** (teacher), **diwata** (deity), **mukha** (face)

5. Arabic: through Islamic influence in parts of the Philippines
   Examples: **salamat** (thank you), **alam** (know), **halaga** (value)

Many native Tagalog words are related to nature, daily life, and cultural concepts. For example:

- **araw** (sun, day)
- **bahay** (house)
- **puso** (heart)
- **buhay** (life)
- **kapwa** (fellow human being)

### Word formation

Tagalog has a rich system of affixation for word formation. Some common affixes and their functions include:

1. **mag-**: forms verbs, often indicating deliberate action
   Example: **linis** (clean) → **maglinis** (to clean)

2. **-an**: forms nouns indicating location or reciprocal action
   Example: **kain** (eat) → **kainan** (dining place)

3. **ka-**: forms abstract nouns or indicates companionship
   Example: **ibigan** (love) → **kaibigan** (friend)

4. **pa-**: forms causative verbs
   Example: **kain** (eat) → **pakain** (to feed)

   Example: **ganda** (beauty) → **maganda** (beautiful)

6. **naka-**: indicates a state resulting from an action
   Example: **upo** (sit) → **nakaupo** (seated)

### Reduplication

Reduplication is a common feature in Tagalog, used to indicate various meanings:

1. Plurality or variety:
   **bulaklak** (flower) → **bulaklak-bulaklak** (various flowers)

2. Diminutive or approximation:
   **pula** (red) → **pula-pula** (reddish)

3. Intensification:

4. Repetition or continuity:
   **lakad** (walk) → **lakad-lakad** (walking around)

## Colloquial Tagalog

Colloquial Tagalog, especially as spoken in Metro Manila (often called "Manila Tagalog"), has some distinct features compared to formal or written Tagalog:

### Contractions

Many common words and phrases are contracted in casual speech:

- **hindi** → **'di** (not)

- **na**: indicating completion, often added to sentences
  Example: **Tapos na?** (Is it finished?)

- **naman**: used for emphasis or to soften statements
  Example: **Ako naman!** (It's my turn!)

### Code-switching

Code-switching between Tagalog and English (sometimes called "Taglish") is very common in casual speech, especially in urban areas:

- Shortening of words: **celebrity** → **seleb**

### Informal pronouns

Colloquial Tagalog often uses different pronouns from formal speech:

Example: **Eh, alam mo naman, di ba? Mahirap eh.** (Well, you know, right? It's difficult.)

## Grammar details

### Verb conjugation

Tagalog verbs are conjugated for aspect and focus, but not for person or number. Here's a more detailed look at the conjugation of a typical verb, **kain** (eat):

#### Actor focus conjugation:

| Aspect | Affix | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
Infinitive | -um- | **kumain** (to eat)
Imperfective | -um- + CV reduplication | **kumakain** (eating)
Perfective | -um- | **kumain** (ate)
Contemplated | ka- + -an | **kakainin** (will eat)

#### Object focus conjugation:

| Aspect | Affix | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
Infinitive | -in | **kainin** (to eat something)
Imperfective | -in + CV reduplication | **kinakain** (being eaten)
Perfective | -in- | **kinain** (was eaten)
Contemplated | ka- + -in | **kakainin** (will be eaten)

### Ligatures

Tagalog uses ligatures to connect words in certain constructions. The two forms of the ligature are **na** and **-ng**. The **-ng** form is used when the preceding word ends in a vowel, **n**, or **ng**. The **na** form is used elsewhere.

Examples:
- **mabuting tao** (good person)
- **malaking bahay** (big house)
- **bagong kotse** (new car)

### Voice and Transitivity

Tagalog verbs can be classified into several classes based on their voice and transitivity:

1. Actor voice intransitive (AV)
   Example: **Tumakbo ang bata.** (The child ran.)

2. Actor voice transitive (AV)
   Example: **Kumain ako ng mansanas.** (I ate an apple.)

3. Patient voice transitive (PV)
   Example: **Kinain ko ang mansanas.** (I ate the apple.)

4. Locative voice (LV)
   Example: **Binilhan ko ng regalo ang tindahan.** (I bought a gift from the store.)

5. Benefactive voice (BV)
   Example: **Ibinili ko siya ng pagkain.** (I bought food for him/her.)

6. Instrumental voice (IV)
   Example: **Ipinambili ko ng pagkain ang pera.** (I used the money to buy food.)

### Potentive mood

Tagalog has a potentive mood, which expresses ability, involuntary action, or chance occurrences. It's formed with the prefix **maka-** for actor focus and **ma-** for other focuses.

Examples:
- **Nakatulog ako sa klase.** (I accidentally fell asleep in class.)
- **Nakakita ako ng duwende.** (I happened to see a dwarf.)
- **Nabasa ko ang libro.** (I was able to read the book.)

### Causative

Causative constructions, which indicate that the subject causes someone to do something, are formed with the prefix **magpa-** for actor focus:

- **kain** (eat) → **magpakain** (to feed, to cause to eat)
  Example: **Nagpakain ako ng aso.** (I fed a dog. / I caused a dog to eat.)

### Reciprocal actions

Reciprocal actions are indicated by the prefix **mag-** and suffix **-an**:

- **mahal** (love) → **mag-mahalan** (to love each other)
  Example: **Nagmamahalan sila.** (They love each other.)

### Pluralization

While **mga** is the general plural marker, some words have specific plural forms:

- **tao** (person) → **mga tao** (people)
- **bata** (child) → **mga bata** (children)
- But: **anak** (child) → **mga anak** (children)

Some adjectives also have specific plural forms:
- **maganda** (beautiful) → **magaganda** (beautiful, plural)
- **mabait** (kind) → **mabubait** (kind, plural)

### Respect language

Tagalog has a system of respect language, though it's not as extensive as in some other Asian languages:

- **po**: a particle added to show respect, often used with elders or superiors
  Example: **Kumusta po kayo?** (How are you? [respectful])

- **opo**: respectful way of saying "yes"

- **ho**: a less formal version of **po**

Certain words also have respectful equivalents:
- **kain** (eat) → **kain po** (eat [respectful])
- **tulog** (sleep) → **pahinga** (rest [more formal/respectful])

### Comparative and superlative

Comparatives are formed with **mas** (more) and **kaysa** (than):
- **Mas malaki ito kaysa roon.** (This is bigger than that.)

Superlatives use **pinaka-**:
- **pinakamaganda** (most beautiful)
- **pinakamatalino** (smartest)

### Time expressions

Tagalog has a rich system of time expressions:

- **kanina** (earlier)
- **kagabi** (last night)
- **kahapon** (yesterday)
- **bukas** (tomorrow)
- **mamayang gabi** (later tonight)
- **sa isang linggo** (in one week)
- **noong isang taon** (last year)

### Numbers

Tagalog has two number systems: a native system and a Spanish-derived system. The native system is typically used for numbers up to ten, while the Spanish system is often used for larger numbers.

Native numbers (1-10):
1. **isa**
2. **dalawa**
3. **tatlo**
4. **apat**
5. **lima**
6. **anim**
7. **pito**
8. **walo**
9. **siyam**
10. **sampu**

Spanish-derived numbers are also commonly used, especially for larger numbers:
- 20: **bente**
- 30: **trenta**
- 100: **siyento**
- 1000: **mil**

### Reduplication for emphasis

Reduplication is also used for emphasis:

- **malaki** (big) → **malaki-laki** (quite big)
- **mabilis** (fast) → **mabilis-bilis** (pretty fast)

### Topic prominence

Tagalog is a topic-prominent language, meaning that sentences are structured around a topic, which is marked by **ang** (or its personal name equivalent **si**):

- **Matangkad ang lalaki.** (The man is tall.)
- **Binili ng lalaki ang kotse.** (The man bought the car.)

In these sentences, **lalaki** (man) and **kotse** (car) are the respective topics.

### Verbal nouns

Many Tagalog verbs can be turned into nouns by adding the suffix **-an**:

- **kain** (eat) → **kainan** (eating place, restaurant)
- **tulog** (sleep) → **tulugan** (sleeping place, bedroom)

### Loan word adaptation

Tagalog has adapted many loan words, often changing them to fit Tagalog phonology:

- **tren** from English "train"
- **iskwater** from English "squatter"
- **de-lata** from Spanish "de lata" (canned)

### Idiomatic expressions

Tagalog has many idiomatic expressions that don't translate directly:

- **Bahala na**: "Whatever happens, happens" or "Leave it to fate"
- **Tampo**: a feeling of being upset or slighted, but not expressing it directly
- **Kanya-kanya**: "To each their own" or "Every man for himself"
- **Ningas kogon**: describing someone who starts projects with enthusiasm but quickly loses interest
