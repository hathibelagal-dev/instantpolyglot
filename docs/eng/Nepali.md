# Nepali

Nepali (नेपाली, Nepālī) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken primarily in Nepal and parts of India. It is the official language of Nepal and one of the 22 scheduled languages of India. Nepali is closely related to other Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi.

## Writing System

Nepali is written in the Devanagari script, which is also used for Hindi, Sanskrit, and several other Indian languages. The Devanagari script is an abugida, meaning each consonant has an inherent vowel that can be changed or muted using diacritical marks.

### Consonants

Here are the consonants in Nepali, presented with their Devanagari form and romanized equivalent:

| Devanagari | Romanized | Devanagari | Romanized |
|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| क | ka | ख | kha |
| ग | ga | घ | gha |
| ङ | ṅa | च | ca |
| छ | cha | ज | ja |
| झ | jha | ञ | ña |
| ट | ṭa | ठ | ṭha |
| ड | ḍa | ढ | ḍha |
| ण | ṇa | त | ta |
| थ | tha | द | da |
| ध | dha | न | na |
| प | pa | फ | pha |
| ब | ba | भ | bha |
| म | ma | य | ya |
| र | ra | ल | la |
| व | va | श | śa |
| ष | ṣa | स | sa |
| ह | ha | क्ष | kṣa |
| त्र | tra | ज्ञ | jña |

### Vowels

Vowels in Nepali can be independent or dependent (diacritical marks). Here are the vowels with their independent forms, dependent forms, and romanized equivalents:

| Independent | Dependent | Romanized |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| अ | - | a |
| आ | ा | ā |
| इ | ि | i |
| ई | ी | ī |
| उ | ु | u |
| ऊ | ू | ū |
| ऋ | ृ | ṛ |
| ए | े | e |
| ऐ | ै | ai |
| ओ | ो | o |
| औ | ौ | au |

## Phonology

### Consonants

Nepali consonants can be classified based on their place and manner of articulation:

| Manner | Labial | Dental | Retroflex | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Stop | p, b, ph, bh | t, d, th, dh | ṭ, ḍ, ṭh, ḍh | | k, g, kh, gh | |
| Nasal | m | n | ṇ | ñ | ṅ | |
| Fricative | | s | | ś | | h |
| Affricate | | | | c, ch, j, jh | | |
| Approximant | v | l | | y | | |
| Trill | | r | | | | |

### Vowels

Nepali has 11 vowel phonemes:

| Front | Central | Back |
|-------|---------|------|
| i, ī | | u, ū |
| e | a, ə | o |
| ai | | au |

The vowel /ə/ is not represented in the writing system but occurs in speech.

### Pronunciation Rules

1. Inherent vowel: Consonants without a vowel diacritic are pronounced with an inherent short 'a' sound, unless they are at the end of a word or followed by another consonant.

   Example: **कमल** is pronounced as "kamala", not "kml".

2. Consonant clusters: When two consonants appear together without a vowel in between, they form a cluster.

   Example: **स्कूल** (school) is pronounced "skūl".

3. Final consonants: Unlike in Hindi, Nepali often pronounces final consonants.

   Example: **राम** (Rām) is pronounced with the final 'm' sound.

4. Aspiration: Aspirated consonants (kh, gh, ch, jh, ṭh, ḍh, th, dh, ph, bh) are pronounced with a puff of air.

   Example: **खाना** (khānā, food) has an aspirated 'kh' sound.

## Grammar

### Nouns

Nepali nouns are marked for gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). They are also inflected for case.

#### Gender

Most Nepali nouns are either masculine or feminine. Some general rules:

1. Nouns ending in ओ (-o) are usually masculine: **घरो** (gharo, house)
2. Nouns ending in ई (-ī) or इ (-i) are usually feminine: **चिठ्ठी** (ciṭṭhī, letter)

However, there are many exceptions, and gender often needs to be memorized.

#### Number

To form plurals:

1. For masculine nouns ending in ओ (-o), change to आ (-ā): 
   **घरो** (gharo, house) → **घरा** (gharā, houses)

2. For feminine nouns ending in ई (-ī), add हरू (-harū):
   **चिठ्ठी** (ciṭṭhī, letter) → **चिठ्ठीहरू** (ciṭṭhīharū, letters)

3. For other nouns, simply add हरू (-harū):
   **किताब** (kitāb, book) → **किताबहरू** (kitābharū, books)

#### Cases

Nepali has seven cases:

1. Nominative (subject)
2. Accusative (direct object)
3. Instrumental (by means of)
4. Dative (indirect object)
5. Ablative (from)
6. Genitive (possession)
7. Locative (in, at, on)

Case markers are added to the end of nouns. For example:

- Nominative: **केटा** (keṭā, boy)
- Accusative: **केटालाई** (keṭālāī, to the boy)
- Instrumental: **केटाले** (keṭāle, by the boy)
- Dative: **केटालाई** (keṭālāī, for the boy)
- Ablative: **केटाबाट** (keṭābāṭa, from the boy)
- Genitive: **केटाको** (keṭāko, of the boy)
- Locative: **केटामा** (keṭāmā, in/on the boy)

### Pronouns

Nepali pronouns are marked for person, number, and level of respect. Here are the personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | म (ma, I) | हामी (hāmī, we) |
| 2nd (informal) | तँ (tã, you) | तिमीहरू (timīharū, you all) |
| 2nd (formal) | तिमी (timī, you) | तपाईंहरू (tapāī̃harū, you all) |
| 2nd (honorific) | तपाईं (tapāī̃, you) | |
| 3rd (proximal) | यो (yo, this/he/she/it) | यिनीहरू (yinīharū, these/they) |
| 3rd (distal) | त्यो (tyo, that/he/she/it) | तिनीहरू (tinīharū, those/they) |

Pronouns are also inflected for case, similar to nouns.

### Verbs

Nepali verbs are conjugated for tense, aspect, mood, person, number, and honorific level.

#### Verb Stems

Nepali verbs have two stems: present stem and past stem. For example:

- **गर्नु** (garnu, to do)
  - Present stem: **गर्** (gar-)
  - Past stem: **गर्** (gar-)

- **खानु** (khānu, to eat)
  - Present stem: **खा** (khā-)
  - Past stem: **खा** (khā-)

#### Present Tense

The present tense is formed by adding personal endings to the present stem:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | -छु (-chu) | -छौं (-chaũ) |
| 2nd (informal) | -छस् (-chas) | -छौ (-chau) |
| 2nd (formal) | -छौ (-chau) | -छौ (-chau) |
| 3rd | -छ (-cha) | -छन् (-chan) |

Example with **गर्नु** (garnu, to do):

- म गर्छु (ma garchu, I do)
- तिमी गर्छौ (timī garchau, you do)
- उनी गर्छ (unī garcha, he/she does)
- हामी गर्छौं (hāmī garchaũ, we do)

#### Past Tense

The past tense is formed by adding personal endings to the past stem:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | -एँ (-ẽ) | -यौं (-yaũ) |
| 2nd (informal) | -इस् (-is) | -यौ (-yau) |
| 2nd (formal) | -यौ (-yau) | -यौ (-yau) |
| 3rd | -यो (-yo) | -ए (-e) |

Example with **गर्नु** (garnu, to do):

- मैले गरेँ (maile garẽ, I did)
- तिमीले गर्यौ (timīle garyau, you did)
- उसले गर्यो (usle garyo, he/she did)
- हामीले गर्यौं (hāmīle garyaũ, we did)

Note: In the past tense, the subject is often marked with the ergative case marker -ले (-le).

#### Future Tense

The future tense is formed by adding personal endings to the present stem:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | -छु (-chu) | -छौं (-chaũ) |
| 2nd (informal) | -छस् (-chas) | -छौ (-chau) |
| 2nd (formal) | -छौ (-chau) | -छौ (-chau) |
| 3rd | -छ (-cha) | -छन् (-chan) |

Example with **गर्नु** (garnu, to do):

- म गर्नेछु (ma garnechu, I will do)
- तिमी गर्नेछौ (timī garnechau, you will do)
- उनी गर्नेछ (unī garnecha, he/she will do)
- हामी गर्नेछौं (hāmī garnechaũ, we will do)

#### Imperative

The imperative mood is used for commands. It has different forms based on the level of respect:

- Informal: Use the verb stem
  **गर्** (gar, do!)

- Formal: Add -नुहोस् (-nuhos) to the verb stem
  **गर्नुहोस्** (garnuhos, please do!)

#### Aspectual Forms

Nepali has several aspectual forms:

1. Continuous: Verb stem + दै + छ/छु/छौ/etc.
   **म गर्दैछु** (ma gardaichu, I am doing)

2. Perfect: Past participle + छ/छु/छौ/etc.
   **मैले गरेको छु** (maile gareko chu, I have done)

3. Habitual: Verb stem + ने + गर्छु/गर्छौ/गर्छ/etc.
   **म गर्ने गर्छु** (ma garne garchu, I usually do)

### Adjectives

Nepali adjectives usually precede the nouns they modify and do not change for gender or number.

Example:
**राम्रो घर** (rāmro ghar, good house)
**राम्रो घरहरू** (rāmro gharharū, good houses)

Some adjectives can be intensified by doubling:
**ठूलो** (ṭhūlo, big) → **ठूलो ठूलो** (ṭhūlo ṭhūlo, very big)

Comparative and superlative forms are usually formed analytically:

- Comparative: Adjective + भन्दा (bhandā, than)
  **यो त्यो भन्दा राम्रो छ** (yo tyo bhandā rāmro cha, This is better than that)

- Superlative: सबैभन्दा (sabaibhandā, most) + Adjective
  **यो सबैभन्दा राम्रो छ** (yo sabaibhandā rāmro cha, This is the best)

### Postpositions

Nepali uses postpositions instead of prepositions. These come after the noun or pronoun they modify:

- **मा** (mā, in/on/at): **घरमा** (gharmā, in the house)
- **लाई** (lāī, to/for): **रामलाई** (Rāmlāī, to/for Ram)
- **बाट** (bāṭa, from): **काठमाडौंबाट** (Kāṭhmāḍaũbāṭa, from Kathmandu)
- **सँग** (sãga, with): **साथीसँग** (sāthīsãga, with a friend)

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Nepali is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV):

**राम किताब पढ्छ।** (Rām kitāb paḍhcha.)
(Ram book reads.) "Ram reads a book."

However, due to the case system, word order can be flexible for emphasis or stylistic reasons.

### Question Formation

Questions can be formed in several ways:

1. By adding the question particle **के** (ke) at the beginning of a statement:
   **के तिमी नेपाली बोल्छौ?** (Ke timī nepālī bolchau?)
   "Do you speak Nepali?"

2. By using question words:
   **तिमी कहाँ जान्छौ?** (Timī kahā̃ jānchau?)
   "Where are you going?"

3. By using rising intonation with a statement:
   **तिमी नेपाली बोल्छौ?** (Timī nepālī bolchau?)
   "You speak Nepali?"

### Negation

Negation is typically formed by adding **न** (na) before the verb:

**म नेपाली बोल्दिनँ।** (Ma nepālī boldina̐.)
"I don't speak Nepali."

### Honorifics

Nepali has an elaborate system of honorifics, reflecting social status, age, and familiarity. This is reflected in pronouns, verb conjugations, and certain vocabulary choices. Here are some examples:

1. Pronouns:
   - Low (very informal): **तँ** (tã)
   - Mid (informal): **तिमी** (timī)
   - High (formal): **तपाईं** (tapāī̃)

2. Verb forms:
   - Low: **खा** (khā, eat)
   - Mid: **खाऊ** (khāū, eat)
   - High: **खानुहोस्** (khānuhos, eat)

3. Vocabulary:
   - Low/Mid: **घर** (ghar, house)
   - High: **घर** (ghar) or **निवास** (nivās, residence)

Example sentence with different levels of respect:

- Low: **तँ कहाँ जान्छस्?** (Tã kahā̃ jānchas?)
- Mid: **तिमी कहाँ जान्छौ?** (Timī kahā̃ jānchau?)
- High: **तपाईं कहाँ जानुहुन्छ?** (Tapāī̃ kahā̃ jānuhuncha?)

All mean "Where are you going?" but with increasing levels of respect.

## Vocabulary

Nepali vocabulary is primarily derived from Sanskrit, but it also includes words from other languages due to historical and cultural influences.

### Sanskrit-derived Words

Many Nepali words come directly from Sanskrit or are slightly modified Sanskrit words. For example:

- **पुस्तक** (pustak, book)
- **विद्यालय** (vidyālaya, school)
- **आकाश** (ākāś, sky)
- **प्रेम** (prem, love)

### Persian and Arabic Loanwords

Due to historical Persian influence, Nepali has borrowed many words from Persian and Arabic. For example:

- **किताब** (kitāb, book) - from Arabic
- **दुनिया** (duniyā, world) - from Arabic
- **कलम** (kalam, pen) - from Arabic
- **बागी** (bāgī, rebel) - from Persian

### English Loanwords

Modern Nepali has also borrowed many words from English, especially in technical and contemporary domains:

- **कम्प्युटर** (kampyuṭar, computer)
- **मोबाइल** (mobāil, mobile phone)
- **टेलिभिजन** (ṭelibhijan, television)
- **बस** (bas, bus)

### Tibeto-Burman Loanwords

Given Nepal's geographic location, some words have been borrowed from Tibeto-Burman languages:

- **गुन्द्रुक** (gundruk, fermented leafy green vegetable)
- **लाहुरे** (lāhure, soldier)

### Compound Words

Nepali often forms new words by combining existing words:

- **विद्यार्थी** (vidyārthī, student) = विद्या (vidyā, knowledge) + अर्थी (arthī, seeker)
- **जन्मदिन** (janmadin, birthday) = जन्म (janma, birth) + दिन (din, day)

## Idiomatic Expressions

Nepali has many idiomatic expressions that may not translate literally. Here are a few examples:

1. **आँखाको तारा** (ā̃khāko tārā)
   Literal: Star of the eye
   Meaning: Beloved, favorite person

2. **कान खाने** (kān khāne)
   Literal: To eat one's ear
   Meaning: To nag or pester someone

3. **हात्ती आयो हात्ती आयो फुस्सा** (hāttī āyo hāttī āyo phussā)
   Literal: An elephant came, an elephant came, but it was just a mouse
   Meaning: Much ado about nothing

4. **दुई डुंगामा खुट्टा राख्नु** (duī ḍuṅgāmā khuṭṭā rākhnu)
   Literal: To put feet in two boats
   Meaning: To try to do two contradictory things at once

## Colloquial Nepali

Colloquial Nepali often differs from formal or written Nepali. Here are some common features:

1. Shortened forms:
   - **हुन्छ** (huncha, okay) → **हुन्च** (hunch)
   - **गर्नुपर्छ** (garnuparcha, must do) → **गर्नुपर्च** (garnuparch)

2. Particle usage:
   The particle **नि** (ni) is often added to the end of sentences for emphasis or to soften commands:
   - **जाऊ नि** (jāū ni, Just go)
   - **हो नि** (ho ni, Yes, indeed)

3. Filler words:
   - **अनि** (ani, and then)
   - **यस्तो** (yasto, like this)

4. Slang terms:
   - **यार** (yār, friend/dude)
   - **के छ** (ke cha, What's up?)

## Regional Variations

While Standard Nepali is based on the Kathmandu dialect, there are several regional variations:

1. Eastern Nepali:
   - Often drops the final 'o' sound
   - Example: **गयो** (gayo, went) → **गय** (gaya)

2. Western Nepali:
   - Uses **च** (cha) instead of **छ** (cha) in some contexts
   - Example: **छैन** (chain, is not) → **चैन** (chain)

3. Jumli (Far Western) Nepali:
   - Retains some archaic features
   - Example: Uses **थ्यो** (thyo) instead of **थियो** (thiyo) for past tense of 'to be'

## Phonological Processes

Nepali undergoes several phonological processes in connected speech:

1. Assimilation:
   When न (n) is followed by च (ca), it becomes ञ् (ñ)
   Example: **सञ्चो** (sañco, well) instead of **सन्चो** (sanco)

2. Gemination:
   Doubling of consonants in certain contexts
   Example: **छत्ती** (chattī, chest) instead of **छाती** (chātī)

3. Vowel harmony:
   In some dialects, vowels in adjacent syllables tend to become similar
   Example: **पुग्नु** (pugnu, to reach) might be pronounced as **पुगुनु** (pugunu)

## Writing Conventions

1. Punctuation:
   Nepali uses Western punctuation marks, including full stop (।), comma (,), question mark (?), and exclamation mark (!).

2. Abbreviations:
   Common abbreviations include:
   - **श्री** (Śrī, Mr./Mrs./Ms.) → श्री०
   - **रुपैयाँ** (rupaiyā̃, rupees) → रु०

3. Numbers:
   Nepali uses its own numerals, which are different from Western Arabic numerals:
   ०, १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९ (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

## Sentence Structure Examples

1. Simple sentence:
   **म घर जान्छु।** (Ma ghar jānchu.)
   I home go.
   "I go home."

2. Complex sentence:
   **जब म घर पुगें, तब मेरी आमा खाना पकाउँदै थिइन्।** (Jaba ma ghar pugẽ, taba merī āmā khānā pakāũdai thiin.)
   When I home arrived, then my mother food cooking was.
   "When I arrived home, my mother was cooking food."

3. Compound sentence:
   **म स्कूल गएँ र मेरो साथी घर गयो।** (Ma skūl gaẽ ra mero sāthī ghar gayo.)

   "I went to school and my friend went home."

4. Passive voice:
   **यो किताब मेरो दाजुद्वारा लेखिएको थियो।** (Yo kitāb mero dājudvārā lekhieko thiyo.)

   If rain fell if, I home-in-indeed will-stay.
   "If it rains, I will stay at home."

## Discourse Markers

Nepali uses various discourse markers to connect ideas and manage conversation flow:

1. **अनि** (ani, and then): Used to continue a narrative or add information
   **म बिहान उठें। अनि म काम गर्न गएँ।** (Ma bihān uṭhẽ. Ani ma kām garna gaẽ.)
   "I woke up in the morning. And then I went to work."

   "It rained. Therefore, we stayed at home."

## Pragmatics

Nepali, like many languages, has various ways to express politeness, indirectness, and other pragmatic functions:

1. Polite requests:
   Adding **न** (na) at the end of a request softens it:
   **यहाँ आउनुहोस् न।** (Yahā̃ āunuhos na.)
   "Please come here."

2. Indirect speech:
   Using **रे** (re) to indicate reported speech:
   **उनी आउँदैनन् रे।** (Unī āũdainan re.)
   "They say he's not coming."

3. Emphasis:
   Using **पो** (po) for emphasis or surprise:
   **तिमी पो आएछौ!** (Timī po āechau!)
   "Oh, it's you who has come!"

4. Doubt or uncertainty:
   Using **होला** (holā) to express probability:
   **ऊ आउला होला।** (Ū āulā holā.)
   "He might come."
