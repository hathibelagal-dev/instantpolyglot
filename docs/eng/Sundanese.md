I apologize for the brevity. I'll expand the text significantly to provide more depth and examples for each topic. Here's a more comprehensive overview of the Sundanese language:

# Sundanese

Sundanese (**Basa Sunda**) is an Austronesian language spoken by approximately 40 million people, primarily in the western part of Java, Indonesia. It is the second most widely spoken regional language in Indonesia after Javanese. Sundanese belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family and is closely related to other Indonesian languages such as Javanese, Madurese, and Balinese.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Sundanese has 18 consonant phonemes:

| Manner of Articulation | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|------------------------|--------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Plosive | p b | t d | c ɟ | k g | ʔ |
| Nasal | m | n | ɲ | ŋ | |
| Fricative | | s | | | h |
| Approximant | w | l | j | | |
| Trill | | r | | | |

Examples of consonants in words:
- /p/: **panas** ('hot')
- /b/: **beureum** ('red')
- /t/: **tilu** ('three')
- /d/: **daun** ('leaf')
- /c/: **carita** ('story')
- /ɟ/: **jalan** ('road')
- /k/: **kuring** ('I', informal)
- /g/: **gede** ('big')
- /ʔ/: **sa'at** ('moment')
- /m/: **maca** ('to read')
- /n/: **nempo** ('to see')
- /ɲ/: **nyarita** ('to talk')
- /ŋ/: **nginum** ('to drink')
- /s/: **sare** ('to sleep')
- /h/: **hideung** ('black')
- /w/: **wengi** ('night')
- /l/: **laut** ('sea')
- /j/: **ayeuna** ('now')
- /r/: **rasa** ('feeling')

### Vowels

Sundanese has 7 vowel phonemes:

| Front | Central | Back |
|-------|---------|------|
| i | ə | u |
| e | | o |
| ɛ | a | ɔ |

Examples of vowels in words:
- /i/: **iring** ('to follow')
- /ə/: **endog** ('egg')
- /u/: **urang** ('we', inclusive)
- /e/: **enya** ('yes')
- /o/: **omong** ('to speak')
- /ɛ/: **éta** ('that')
- /a/: **aya** ('exist')
- /ɔ/: **bodas** ('white')

### Phonotactics

Sundanese syllable structure is typically (C)V(C), where C is a consonant and V is a vowel. Consonant clusters are rare in native Sundanese words but may occur in loanwords.

Examples:
- CV: **sa** ('one')
- CVC: **bau** ('smell')
- V: **i-eu** ('this')
- VC: **es** ('ice')

More complex examples:
- CVCCVC: **tangkal** ('tree')
- CVCCV: **bungsu** ('youngest child')
- CVCCCVC: **ngampleng** ('to hit')

### Stress

Stress in Sundanese is typically on the penultimate syllable of a word, but there are exceptions, especially in loanwords.

Examples:
- **ku**da ('horse')
- **sa**patu ('shoe')
- **bu**ku ('book')
- **kala**pa ('coconut')
- **mang**ga ('mango')

Exceptions:
- **ban**dung** (city name)
- **ja**kar**ta** (city name, loanword)

### Phonological Processes

#### Nasal Assimilation

When the active verb prefix **N-** is added to a stem, it assimilates to the place of articulation of the following consonant:

- **N-** + **p**, **b** → **m-**
  Example: **maca** ('to read') from **N-** + **baca**

- **N-** + **t**, **d** → **n-**
  Example: **nulis** ('to write') from **N-** + **tulis**

- **N-** + **c**, **j**, **s** → **ny-**
  Example: **nyapu** ('to sweep') from **N-** + **sapu**

- **N-** + **k**, **g** → **ng-**
  Example: **ngadahar** ('to eat') from **N-** + **dahar**

Additional examples:
- **N-** + **penta** → **menta** ('to ask for')
- **N-** + **damel** → **ndamel** ('to make')
- **N-** + **jual** → **nyual** ('to sell')
- **N-** + **ganti** → **ngaganti** ('to change')

#### Vowel Harmony

In some dialects, there is a tendency for vowels in adjacent syllables to be similar in height. This is particularly noticeable with the vowels /a/ and /ə/.

Examples:
- **balik** ('to return') may be pronounced as **bəlik** in some dialects
- **dasar** ('base') may be pronounced as **dəsər**
- **mahal** ('expensive') may be pronounced as **məhəl**

This process is not consistent across all Sundanese dialects and may vary depending on the specific words and speakers.

## Writing System

Sundanese has been written using various scripts throughout history, including:

1. Sundanese script (Aksara Sunda)
2. Pegon script (Arabic-based)
3. Latin script

Currently, the Latin script is the most commonly used for writing Sundanese.

### Sundanese Script (Aksara Sunda)

The traditional Sundanese script, known as Aksara Sunda, is an abugida writing system. It consists of:

- 32 basic letters (aksara ngalagena)
- Vowel diacritics (rarangkén)
- Special consonant signs

Example in Aksara Sunda:
ᮘᮞ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ (basa sunda)

The basic letters (aksara ngalagena) represent consonants with an inherent /a/ vowel. Vowel diacritics (rarangkén) are used to change the inherent vowel or to represent vowels at the beginning of syllables.

Examples of aksara ngalagena:
- ᮊ (ka)
- ᮌ (ga)
- ᮍ (nga)
- ᮎ (ca)
- ᮏ (ja)
- ᮑ (nya)

Examples of rarangkén:
- ᮤ (i)
- ᮥ (u)
- ᮦ (é)
- ᮧ (o)
- ᮨ (e)
- ᮩ (eu)

Example word in Aksara Sunda:
ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ (sunda)

### Pegon Script

The Pegon script is an Arabic-based writing system that was historically used for writing Sundanese, particularly in religious contexts. It adds additional characters to represent sounds not found in Arabic but present in Sundanese.

Example in Pegon script:
باس سوندا (basa sunda)

### Latin Script

The modern Latin-based orthography for Sundanese includes the following letters:

a, b, c, d, e, é, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z

Special characters:
- **é** represents [e]
- **eu** represents [ə]

Example in Latin script:
**basa sunda**

Additional examples:
- **cai** ('water')
- **gunung** ('mountain')
- **éta** ('that')
- **eunteung** ('mirror')

## Grammar

### Nouns

Sundanese nouns are generally not inflected for number, gender, or case. Plurality can be expressed through context, reduplication, or by using quantifiers.

Examples:
- **buku** ('book' or 'books')
- **buku-buku** ('books', reduplication)
- **sababaraha buku** ('several books', using a quantifier)

Additional examples:
- **imah** ('house') → **imah-imah** ('houses')
- **jalma** ('person') → **jalma-jalma** ('people')
- **loba tangkal** ('many trees')
- **saréréa murid** ('all students')

Sundanese does not have a grammatical gender system, but some nouns may have different forms for male and female referents:

- **budak** ('child') → **budak lalaki** ('boy'), **budak awewe** ('girl')
- **guru** ('teacher') → **guru lalaki** ('male teacher'), **guru awewe** ('female teacher')

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Sundanese:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **abdi** (formal), **kuring** (informal) | **urang** (inclusive), **abdi sarerea** (exclusive, formal) |
| 2nd | **anjeun** (formal), **maneh** (informal) | **aranjeun** (formal), **maraneh** (informal) |
| 3rd | **anjeunna** (formal), **manehna** (informal) | **aranjeunna** (formal), **maranehna** (informal) |

Examples in sentences:
- **Abdi ngiring ka pasar** ('I am going to the market', formal)
- **Kuring rék dahar** ('I want to eat', informal)
- **Urang kudu gotong royong** ('We must work together', inclusive)
- **Anjeun tiasa basa Sunda?** ('Can you speak Sundanese?', formal)
- **Manehna keur sare** ('He/She is sleeping', informal)

Demonstrative pronouns:
- **ieu** ('this')
- **eta** ('that', near the listener)
- **itu** ('that', far from both speaker and listener)

Examples:
- **Ieu buku kuring** ('This is my book')
- **Eta naon?** ('What is that?', near the listener)
- **Itu gunung naon?** ('What mountain is that?', far from both speaker and listener)

Possessive pronouns are formed by adding the particle **-na** to personal pronouns:

- **buku kuringna** ('my book')
- **imah manehna** ('his/her house')
- **motor aranjeunna** ('their motorcycle')

### Verbs

Sundanese verbs do not conjugate for person, number, or tense. Tense and aspect are typically indicated by context or time markers.

Verbal affixes play a significant role in Sundanese, modifying the meaning or function of verbs:

1. Prefix **N-**: forms active verbs
   Example: **nulis** ('to write') from **tulis** ('write')

2. Prefix **di-**: forms passive verbs
   Example: **ditulis** ('to be written')

3. Prefix **nga-**: forms intransitive verbs
   Example: **ngagedé** ('to grow big') from **gedé** ('big')

4. Prefix **pa-**: forms causative verbs
   Example: **pagedé** ('to make bigger')

5. Infix **-um-**: forms intransitive verbs
   Example: **gumeulis** ('to act beautifully') from **geulis** ('beautiful')

6. Suffix **-keun**: forms transitive verbs
   Example: **tuliskeun** ('to write something')

7. Suffix **-an**: forms reciprocal or habitual verbs
   Example: **tulis-tulisan** ('to write to each other')

Additional examples:

- **dahar** ('eat') → **ngadahar** ('to eat'), **didahar** ('to be eaten')
- **buka** ('open') → **muka** ('to open'), **dibuka** ('to be opened')
- **gedé** ('big') → **ngagedéan** ('to become bigger'), **digedéan** ('to be enlarged')
- **asup** ('enter') → **ngasupkeun** ('to put in'), **diasupkeun** ('to be put in')
- **carita** ('story') → **nyarita** ('to tell a story'), **cacarita** ('to chat')

Tense and aspect are often expressed using time markers or auxiliary verbs:

- Present: **keur** ('currently')
  Example: **Manehna keur dahar** ('He/She is eating')

- Past: **geus** ('already')
  Example: **Abdi geus maca éta buku** ('I have already read that book')

- Future: **rék** ('will')
  Example: **Urang rék indit ka sakola** ('We will go to school')

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Sundanese typically follow the noun they modify.

Example:
**buku alus** ('good book')

Additional examples:
- **imah gedé** ('big house')
- **budak pinter** ('smart child')
- **cai panas** ('hot water')
- **gunung luhur** ('high mountain')

Comparative and superlative forms are created using additional words:

- Comparative: **leuwih** + adjective
  Example: **leuwih alus** ('better')

  Example: **pangleuwiha alus** ('best')

Additional examples:
- **Manehna leuwih jangkung ti batan kuring** ('He/She is taller than me')
- **Ieu pangleuwiha mahal** ('This is the most expensive')

Adjectives can also be intensified through reduplication:
- **gedé** ('big') → **gedé-gedé** ('very big')
- **alus** ('good') → **alus-alus** ('very good')

### Numbers

Cardinal numbers:

1. **hiji**
2. **dua**
3. **tilu**
4. **opat**
5. **lima**
6. **genep**
7. **tujuh**
8. **dalapan**
9. **salapan**
10. **sapuluh**
20. **dua puluh**
50. **lima puluh**
100. **saratus**
1000. **sarebu**

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding the prefix **ka-** to cardinal numbers:

- **kahiji** ('first')
- **kadua** ('second')
- **katilu** ('third')

Examples in sentences:
- **Abdi boga lima buku** ('I have five books')
- **Manehna anak kadua** ('He/She is the second child')

### Word Order

The basic word order in Sundanese is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).

Example:
**Abdi ngadahar roti** ('I eat bread')

However, other word orders are possible for emphasis or in specific constructions.

- OSV: **Roti abdi ngadahar** ('It's bread that I eat')
- VOS: **Ngadahar roti abdi** ('Eating bread, I am')

In phrases, modifiers typically follow the word they modify:
- Noun + Adjective: **baju bodas** ('white shirt')
- Noun + Possessive: **buku kuring** ('my book')
- Verb + Adverb

## Syntax

### Negation

Negation in Sundanese is typically expressed using the word **henteu** ('not') before the verb or adjective.

Example:
**Abdi henteu ngadahar** ('I do not eat')

Additional examples:
- **Manehna henteu pinter** ('He/She is not smart')
- **Urang henteu boga waktu** ('We don't have time')

For nouns, the negation word **lain** ('not') is used.

Example:
**Lain buku** ('Not a book')

Additional examples:
- **Ieu lain imah kuring** ('This is not my house')
- **Manehna lain guru** ('He/She is not a teacher')

Double negation is possible and often used for emphasis:
**Abdi henteu teu terang** ('I don't not know' = 'I certainly know')

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the particle **naha** at the beginning of a statement or by using rising intonation.

Example:
**Naha anjeun ngadahar?** ('Do you eat?')

Additional examples:
- **Naha manehna geus datang?** ('Has he/she arrived?')
- **Anjeun tiasa basa Sunda?** ('Can you speak Sundanese?', using intonation)

Wh-questions use question words such as:

- **naon** ('what')

Additional examples:
- **Jalma anu dipikaresep ku kuring** ('The person whom I like')
- **Imah anu gedé éta** ('That house which is big')
- **Kota anu urang kunjungan kamari** ('The city that we visited yesterday')

### Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences often use the word **lamun** ('if') to introduce the condition.

Example:
**Lamun hujan, abdi moal indit** ('If it rains, I won't go')

Additional examples:
- **Lamun anjeun datang, urang bisa papanggih** ('If you come, we can meet')
- **Lamun kuring boga duit, kuring rék meuli imah** ('If I had money, I would buy a house')

### Serial Verb Constructions

Sundanese allows for serial verb constructions, where two or more verbs are used together without conjunctions:

- **Manehna indit meuli baju** ('He/She went to buy clothes')
- **Kuring cicing ngajar di sakola** ('I live and teach at school')

### Topic-Comment Structures

Sundanese often uses topic-comment structures, where the topic is introduced first, followed by a comment about it:

- **Buku éta mah, kuring geus maca** ('That book, I have already read')
- **Kota Bandung mah, urang kungsi nganjang** ('As for Bandung city, we have visited before')

## Vocabulary

Sundanese vocabulary has been influenced by various languages throughout its history, including:

   - **sae** ('good', polite)

These loanwords often undergo phonological adaptation to fit Sundanese phonology.

## Dialects

Sundanese has several dialects, which can be broadly categorized into:

1. Northern dialects
2. Central dialects
3. Southern dialects

Some notable dialects include:

- Banten Sundanese: Spoken in Banten province, characterized by a distinct accent and some vocabulary differences.
  Example: **aing** (I) instead of standard **kuring**

- Bogor Sundanese: Spoken in and around Bogor, known for its unique intonation patterns.
  Example: tendency to raise pitch at the end of sentences

- Priangan Sundanese: Considered the standard form, spoken in the Parahyangan region including Bandung.
  Example: Used as the basis for written Sundanese and formal communication

- Cirebon Sundanese: Heavily influenced by Javanese, spoken in the Cirebon region.
  Example: **ingsun** (I) instead of standard **kuring**

Differences between dialects can include vocabulary, pronunciation, and even some grammatical features. For example:

- The word for "not" varies: **henteu** (standard), **moal** (Banten), **embung** (Cirebon)
- Pronunciation of /a/ in final syllables: [a] in Priangan, [ɔ] in some northern dialects
- Use of different personal pronouns across dialects

## Levels of Speech

Sundanese, like Javanese, has a system of speech levels that reflect the social relationship between the speaker and the listener. There are three main levels:

1. **Basa Lemes** (Polite): Used when speaking to people of higher social status or in formal situations.
2. **Basa Loma** (Familiar): Used among friends or people of equal social status.
3. **Basa Kasar** (Crude): Used in very informal situations or when expressing strong emotions.

Examples:

| Meaning | Basa Lemes | Basa Loma | Basa Kasar |
|---------|------------|-----------|------------|
| 'eat' | **neda** | **dahar** | **nyatu** |
| 'sleep' | **kulem** | **saré** | **mondok** |
| 'go' | **angkat** | **indit** | **leumpang** |
| 'house' | **bumi** | **imah** | **imah** |
| 'drink' | **leueut** | **nginum** | **nginum** |
| 'say' | **nyarios** | **ngomong** | **ngomong** |

Sentences illustrating the use of different speech levels:

Basa Lemes:
**Abdi neda heula, mangga angkat ka bumi** 
('I will eat first, please go to the house')

Basa Loma:
**Kuring dahar heula, hayu urang indit ka imah**
('I'll eat first, let's go to the house')

Basa Kasar:
**Aing nyatu heula, hayu leumpang ka imah**
('I'm gonna eat first, let's go to the house')

The choice of speech level depends on various factors such as age, social status, familiarity, and context. It's an important aspect of Sundanese culture and etiquette.

## Idiomatic Expressions
