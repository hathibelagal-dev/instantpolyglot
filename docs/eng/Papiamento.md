# Papiamento

Papiamento is a creole language spoken in the ABC islands of the Dutch Caribbean: Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao. It has approximately 330,000 native speakers and is one of the official languages of Aruba and Curaçao. Papiamento developed from a mixture of Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, English, and African languages, primarily during the period of Dutch colonization.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Papiamento uses the Latin alphabet and has two standardized orthographies: the etymological spelling used in Aruba, and the phonemic spelling used in Curaçao and Bonaire. This overview will primarily use the Curaçao/Bonaire spelling, with Aruban variants noted where relevant.

### Stress

4. **Danki** [ˈdaŋki] - "Thank you"

## Morphology

Papiamento has relatively simple morphology compared to its source languages, with limited inflection and a preference for analytical structures.

### Nouns

Nouns in Papiamento do not inflect for gender or case. Plurals are generally formed by adding the suffix **-nan**:

- **kas** (house) → **kasnan** (houses)
- **auto** (car) → **autonan** (cars)

Some nouns, particularly those ending in -a, change their final vowel to -e before adding -nan:

- **mesa** (table) → **mesenan** (tables)
- **kaya** (street) → **kayenan** (streets)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Papiamento do not change form based on case:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **mi** | **nos** |
| 2nd | **bo** | **boso** |
| 3rd | **e** | **nan** |

Possessive pronouns are formed by adding **di** before the personal pronoun:

- **di mi** (my)
- **di bo** (your, singular)
- **di nos** (our)
- **di boso** (your, plural)
- **di e** (his/her/its)
- **di nan** (their)

Examples:
- **Mi ta kome** - "I am eating"
- **Nos kas** - "Our house"
- **E ta di bo** - "It is yours"

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Papiamento do not agree with nouns in gender or number. They typically come after the noun they modify:

- **un kas grandi** - "a big house"
- **e outo bieu** - "the old car"

Comparative and superlative forms are created analytically:

- Comparative: **mas** + adjective
  - **E kas aki ta mas grandi** - "This house is bigger"

- Superlative: **e mas** + adjective
  - **Esaki ta e kas mas grandi** - "This is the biggest house"

### Verbs

Papiamento verbs do not conjugate for person or number. Tense, aspect, and mood are expressed through particles placed before the verb.

#### Present tense

The present tense is formed with the particle **ta**:

- **Mi ta kome** - "I eat" / "I am eating"
- **Bo ta traha** - "You work" / "You are working"

#### Past tense

The past tense uses the particle **a**:

- **Mi a kome** - "I ate"
- **Nos a bai** - "We went"

#### Future tense

The future tense is formed with **lo**:

- **Mi lo kome** - "I will eat"
- **Nan lo yega** - "They will arrive"

#### Progressive aspect

The progressive aspect is expressed using **ta** + **-ndo** suffix:

- **Mi ta komendo** - "I am eating"
- **E ta trahando** - "He/She is working"

#### Perfect aspect

The perfect aspect uses **a** + past participle:

- **Mi a kome** - "I have eaten"
- **Nos a yega** - "We have arrived"

Past participles are usually formed by adding **-á**, **-í**, or **-ú** to the verb stem:

- **kome** → **komé**
- **bebe** → **bebí**
- **bende** → **bendé**

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed by using the bare verb:

- **Kome!** - "Eat!"
- **Bai!** - "Go!"

#### Negation

Verbs are negated by placing **no** before the tense particle:

- **Mi no ta kome** - "I am not eating"
- **E no a bini** - "He/She did not come"

### Examples

1. **Mi ta papia Papiamento** - "I speak Papiamento"
2. **Nos a yega ayera** - "We arrived yesterday"

Papiamento generally follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order:

- **Mi ta kome pan** - "I eat bread"
- **E mucha ta hunga bala** - "The child plays ball"

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by changing the intonation of a statement:

- **Bo ta kome?** - "Are you eating?"
- **Nan a yega kaba?** - "Have they arrived already?"

Wh-questions use interrogative words at the beginning of the sentence:

- **Kiko bo ta kome?** - "What are you eating?"
- **Unda bo ta bai?** - "Where are you going?"
- **Ken a bini?** - "Who came?"

### Negation

Negation is expressed by placing **no** before the verb or verb particle:

- **Mi no ta kome karni** - "I don't eat meat"
- **E no a yega ainda** - "He/She hasn't arrived yet"

### Possession

Possession is indicated by placing the possessor after the possessed item, often with **di** in between:

- **e kas di mi tata** - "my father's house"
- **e outo di Maria** - "Maria's car"

For inalienable possession (body parts, family members), **di** is often omitted:

- **e kabes e mucha** - "the child's head"
- **e ruman John** - "John's sibling"

### Adjective placement

As mentioned earlier, adjectives typically follow the noun they modify:

- **un kas grandi** - "a big house"
- **e homber haltu** - "the tall man"

However, some common adjectives can precede the noun:

- **bon dia** - "good day"
- **mal tempu** - "bad weather"

### Adverb placement

Adverbs usually come after the verb or at the end of the sentence:

- **E ta kanta bunita** - "She sings beautifully"

Time adverbs often appear at the beginning or end of a sentence:

### Serial verb constructions
