# Historical Indo-Aryan Linguistics

Indo-Aryan languages form a major branch of the Indo-European language family, primarily spoken in the Indian subcontinent. This branch includes languages like Sanskrit, Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, and many others. The historical development of Indo-Aryan languages spans over 3500 years, providing a rich field for linguistic study.

## Periodization

The development of Indo-Aryan languages is typically divided into three main periods:

1. Old Indo-Aryan (OIA): c. 1500 BCE - 600 BCE
2. Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA): c. 600 BCE - 1000 CE
3. New Indo-Aryan (NIA): c. 1000 CE - present

Each period is characterized by distinct linguistic features and developments.

### Old Indo-Aryan (OIA)

The Old Indo-Aryan period is primarily represented by Vedic Sanskrit and Classical Sanskrit. Vedic Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas, the oldest known Sanskrit texts, while Classical Sanskrit is the standardized form codified by Pāṇini around 400 BCE.

#### Phonology

Old Indo-Aryan had a rich phonological system, including:

1. Vowels: 
   - Short: **a**, **i**, **u**
   - Long: **ā**, **ī**, **ū**
   - Diphthongs: **e**, **ai**, **o**, **au**
   - Syllabic consonants: **ṛ**, **ṝ**, **ḷ**, **ḹ**

2. Consonants:
   - Stops: Voiceless, voiced, and aspirated series at five points of articulation
     - Velars: **k**, **kh**, **g**, **gh**
     - Palatals: **c**, **ch**, **j**, **jh**
     - Retroflexes: **ṭ**, **ṭh**, **ḍ**, **ḍh**
     - Dentals: **t**, **th**, **d**, **dh**
     - Labials: **p**, **ph**, **b**, **bh**
   - Nasals: Five, corresponding to each stop series (**ṅ**, **ñ**, **ṇ**, **n**, **m**)
   - Semivowels: **y**, **r**, **l**, **v**
   - Sibilants: **ś**, **ṣ**, **s**
   - Glottal: **h**

Examples of phonological contrasts:

1. Vowel length:
   **vana** [ˈvənə] “forest” vs. **vāṇa** [ˈvaːɳə] “arrow”

2. Aspiration:
   **kāla** [ˈkaːlə] “time” vs. **khāla** [ˈkʰaːlə] “threshing floor”

3. Retroflex vs. dental:
   **maṇi** [ˈməɳi] “jewel” vs. **mani** [ˈməni] “to think”

4. Sibilant distinctions:
   **śaṅkha** [ˈʃəŋkʰə] “conch” vs. **ṣaṇḍa** [ˈʂəɳɖə] “bull” vs. **sapta** [ˈsəptə] “seven”

#### Morphology

Old Indo-Aryan was highly inflectional, with a complex system of nominal and verbal morphology.

1. Nouns:
   - Three genders: masculine, feminine, neuter
   - Three numbers: singular, dual, plural
   - Eight cases: nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative

Example of noun declension for **deva** “god” (masculine):

| Case | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| Nominative | **devaḥ** | **devau** | **devāḥ** |
| Accusative | **devam** | **devau** | **devān** |
| Instrumental | **devena** | **devābhyām** | **devaiḥ** |
| Dative | **devāya** | **devābhyām** | **devebhyaḥ** |
| Ablative | **devāt** | **devābhyām** | **devebhyaḥ** |
| Genitive | **devasya** | **devayoḥ** | **devānām** |
| Locative | **deve** | **devayoḥ** | **deveṣu** |
| Vocative | **deva** | **devau** | **devāḥ** |

Example of noun declension for **nadī** “river” (feminine):

| Case | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| Nominative | **nadī** | **nadyau** | **nadyaḥ** |
| Accusative | **nadīm** | **nadyau** | **nadīḥ** |
| Instrumental | **nadyā** | **nadībhyām** | **nadībhiḥ** |
| Dative | **nadyai** | **nadībhyām** | **nadībhyaḥ** |
| Ablative | **nadyāḥ** | **nadībhyām** | **nadībhyaḥ** |
| Genitive | **nadyāḥ** | **nadyoḥ** | **nadīnām** |
| Locative | **nadyām** | **nadyoḥ** | **nadīṣu** |
| Vocative | **nadi** | **nadyau** | **nadyaḥ** |

2. Verbs:
   - Complex system of tenses, moods, and aspects
   - Three persons, three numbers
   - Active and middle voices
   - Ten classes of present stems

Example of verb conjugation for **bhū** “to be” in the present tense (active voice):

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **bhavāmi** | **bhavāvaḥ** | **bhavāmaḥ** |
| 2nd | **bhavasi** | **bhavathaḥ** | **bhavatha** |
| 3rd | **bhavati** | **bhavataḥ** | **bhavanti** |

Example of verb conjugation for **kṛ** “to do” in the imperfect tense (active voice):

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **akaravam** | **akarava** | **akarma** |
| 2nd | **akaroḥ** | **akurutam** | **akuruta** |
| 3rd | **akarot** | **akurutām** | **akurvan** |

3. Adjectives:
   Adjectives in Old Indo-Aryan agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case.

Example: **mahānt** “great”

Masculine singular nominative: **mahān**
Feminine singular nominative: **mahatī**
Neuter singular nominative: **mahat**

4. Pronouns:
   Old Indo-Aryan had a rich pronominal system, including personal, demonstrative, relative, and interrogative pronouns.

Example: Personal pronouns (nominative case)

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **aham** | **āvām** | **vayam** |
| 2nd | **tvam** | **yuvām** | **yūyam** |
| 3rd (m.) | **saḥ** | **tau** | **te** |
| 3rd (f.) | **sā** | **te** | **tāḥ** |
| 3rd (n.) | **tat** | **te** | **tāni** |

5. Compounds:
   Sanskrit was known for its extensive use of compound words, which could be quite long and complex.

Types of compounds:
- Dvandva (copulative): **rāma-kṛṣṇau** “Rama and Krishna”
- Tatpuruṣa (determinative): **rāja-putraḥ** “king's son”
- Karmadhāraya (descriptive): **nīla-kamalam** “blue lotus”
- Bahuvrīhi (possessive): **bahuvṛīhiḥ** “having much rice” (name of this compound type)
- Avyayībhāva (adverbial): **yathāśakti** “according to ability”

#### Syntax

Old Indo-Aryan had a relatively free word order, with SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) being the most common. The rich case system allowed for flexibility in word order without loss of meaning.

Examples:

1. SOV (most common):
   **rāmaḥ sītām paśyati** “Rama sees Sita”

2. OSV:
   **sītām rāmaḥ paśyati** “Rama sees Sita”

3. VOS:
   **paśyati sītām rāmaḥ** “Rama sees Sita”

All these sentences convey the same meaning despite the different word orders.

Other syntactic features:

1. Use of participles:
   **gataḥ rāmaḥ vanam apaśyat** “Having gone, Rama saw the forest”

2. Absolute constructions:
   **rāme gate sītā rudati** “Rama having gone, Sita weeps”

3. Periphrastic constructions:
   **kartā bhavati** “He will do” (lit. “He becomes a doer”)

### Middle Indo-Aryan (MIA)

The Middle Indo-Aryan period saw significant changes in phonology, morphology, and syntax. This period includes Prakrits, Pali, and Apabhramsa languages.

#### Phonological Changes

1. Loss of aspirated voiced consonants
   OIA **bhavati** > MIA **havadi** “becomes”
   OIA **gharma** > MIA **ghamma** “heat”

2. Simplification of consonant clusters
   OIA **kṣetra** > MIA **khetta** “field”
   OIA **brahman** > MIA **bamhaṇa** “brahmin”

3. Vowel changes
   OIA **vṛkṣa** > MIA **rukkha** “tree”
   OIA **duhitṛ** > MIA **dhīdā** “daughter”

4. Development of new vowels
   OIA **kalya** > MIA **kajja** “work”
   OIA **satya** > MIA **sacca** “truth”

5. Loss of final consonants
   OIA **vāk** > MIA **vāyā** “speech”
   OIA **aham** > MIA **ahaṃ** “I”

6. Palatalization
   OIA **kṛta** > MIA **kata** > Late MIA **kia** “done”

#### Morphological Changes

1. Reduction in case system
   The eight-case system of OIA was reduced to three or four cases in many MIA languages.

Example from Pali:
OIA (8 cases) > Pali (4 cases)
Nominative: **rāmo** > **rāmo**
Accusative: **rāmam** > **rāmaṃ**
Instrumental/Ablative/Locative: **rāmeṇa**/**rāmā**/**rāme** > **rāmena**
Genitive/Dative: **rāmasya**/**rāmāya** > **rāmassa**

2. Loss of dual number
   The dual number was lost, leaving only singular and plural.

OIA: **devau** (two gods) > MIA: merged with plural **devā**

3. Simplification of verbal system
   Many OIA tenses and moods were lost or merged.

Example from Pali:
OIA **gacchati** “he goes” (present indicative)
OIA **gacchet** “he may go” (optative)
Pali **gacchati** for both meanings

4. Development of new tenses
   MIA languages developed new analytical tenses.

Example from Apabhramsa:
**karu achi** “I am doing” (present continuous)

5. Changes in gender system
   Some MIA languages saw a reduction in gender distinctions.

Example from Maharastri Prakrit:
OIA **putraḥ** (masc.), **kanyā** (fem.), **phalam** (neut.) 
> Maharastri **putto** (masc.), **kaṇṇā** (fem.), **phalaṃ** (masc.)

#### Syntactic Changes

1. Increased use of postpositions
   MIA began to use postpositions to express case relationships, a trend that continued into NIA.

Example from Apabhramsa:
**gharasya upari** (OIA) > **ghara uvari** (Apabhramsa) “on top of the house”

2. Development of ergative constructions
   Some MIA languages began to show ergative patterns in past tense constructions.

Example from Apabhramsa:
**maï kahiu** “by me (it was) said” (ergative construction)

3. Shift towards analytic constructions
   MIA languages started using more analytic constructions instead of synthetic forms.

Example from Pali:
OIA **kartavyam** “should be done” > Pali **kātabbaṃ hoti** “becomes to be done”

4. Changes in word order
   While still flexible, there was a trend towards more consistent SOV order in MIA.

Example from Pali:
**so taṃ kammaṃ akāsi** “He did that work” (SOV order more consistent)

### New Indo-Aryan (NIA)

The New Indo-Aryan period represents the development of modern Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, and others.

#### Phonological Developments

1. Loss of phonemic distinction between short and long vowels in many languages
   Hindi **din** “day” (< OIA **dina**)
   Bengali **din** “day” (< OIA **dina**)

2. Development of new phonemes
   Hindi retroflex flap **ṛ** as in **baṛā** “big”
   Punjabi voiced aspirates becoming tones: **kòṛā** “horse” (< OIA **ghoṭaka**)

3. Nasalization becoming phonemic
   Hindi **hā̃** “yes” vs. **hā** “oh”
   Bengali **cā̐d** “moon” vs. **cād** “taste”

4. Development of schwa
   Hindi unstressed **a** often pronounced as [ə]: **kamal** [kəməl] “lotus”

5. Simplification of sibilants
   Most NIA languages have only one sibilant, usually /s/
   Hindi **sāt** “seven” (< OIA **sapta**)

#### Morphological Developments

1. Further simplification of case system
   Most NIA languages have two or three cases, with postpositions used for other relations.

Example from Hindi:
Direct case: **laṛkā** “boy”
Oblique case: **laṛke**
Vocative case: **laṛke**

Other relations expressed by postpositions:
**laṛke ko** “to the boy” (dative)
**laṛke kā** “of the boy” (genitive)
**laṛke se** “from/by the boy” (ablative/instrumental)

2. Development of new tense-aspect distinctions
   Hindi perfective **maine khāyā** “I ate” vs. imperfective **main khātā thā** “I was eating”
   Bengali **āmi kheyechi** “I have eaten” vs. **āmi khācchi** “I am eating”

3. Emergence of compound verbs
   Hindi **kha lenā** “to eat up” (lit. “to eat take”)
   Bengali **kore phelā** “to do completely” (lit. “to do throw”)

4. Development of definite articles in some languages
   Bengali **-ṭā/-ṭi**: **baiṭā** “the book”, **meyeṭi** “the girl”

5. Grammaticalization of honorifics
   Hindi **āp** (honorific “you”) with special verb forms: **āp jāte haiṁ** “You (honorific) go”

6. Loss of grammatical gender in some languages
   Bengali has lost the gender system entirely: **bhālo chele** “good boy”, **bhālo meye** “good girl”

7. Development of inclusive/exclusive distinction in pronouns
   Marathi **āmhī** (exclusive “we”) vs. **āpaṇ** (inclusive “we”)

#### Syntactic Developments

1. Solidification of SOV word order
   Hindi **maiṁ kitāb paṛhtā hūṁ** “I book read am” (I read a book)
   Bengali **āmi bai paṛi** “I book read” (I read a book)

2. Development of complex ergative patterns
   Hindi ergative construction in perfective aspect:
   **laṛke ne kitāb paṛhī** “The boy read the book” (lit. “By the boy book was read”)
   Marathi: **mulāne pustak vācale** “The boy read the book”

3. Increased use of relative-correlative constructions
   Hindi **jo āyā, vah merā bhāī hai** “Who came, he is my brother” (The one who came is my brother)
   Bengali **je āsbe, se āmār bhāi** “Who will come, he (is) my brother”

4. Development of quotative constructions
   Hindi **usne kahā ki vah āegā** “He said that he will come” (lit. “He said that he will come”)
   Marathi **tyāne mhaṭle kī to yeīl** “He said that he will come”

5. Verb serialization
   Hindi **vah gā kar nahātā hai** “He sings while bathing” (lit. “He sing having bathes”)

6. Development of complex predicates
   Hindi **intazār karnā** “to wait” (lit. “waiting to do”)
   Bengali **bhraman karā** “to travel” (lit. “travel to do”)

These systematic correspondences help in reconstructing earlier forms and understanding the historical relationships between Indo-Aryan languages.

## Writing Systems

Indo-Aryan languages use various writing systems, most of which are ultimately derived from the Brahmi script:

1. Devanagari: Used for Hindi, Marathi, Nepali
   Example (Hindi): **नमस्ते** (namaste)

2. Bengali-Assamese script: Used for Bengali and Assamese
   Example (Bengali): **ভালো আছেন** (bhālo āchen)

3. Gurmukhi: Used for Punjabi in India
   Example: **ਸਤਿ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਅਕਾਲ** (sat srī akāl)

4. Perso-Arabic script: Used for Urdu and Sindhi
   Example (Urdu): **خوش آمدید** (khush āmdīd)

5. Sinhala script: Used for Sinhala
   Example: **ආයුබෝවන්** (āyubōvan)

6. Odia script: Used for Odia
   Example: **ନମସ୍କାର** (namaskāra)

7. Gujarati script: Used for Gujarati
   Example: **કેમ છો** (kem cho)

These scripts have evolved to suit the phonological needs of their respective languages, often developing new characters or diacritical marks to represent sounds not present in the original Brahmi script.

## Dialectology

Indo-Aryan languages exhibit significant dialectal variation, often forming dialect continua across geographical regions. Some notable dialect groups include:

1. Western Hindi dialects:
   - Braj Bhasha: **हम का करैं** (ham kā karaim) “What should we do?”
   - Awadhi: **का करी** (kā karī) “What to do?”
   - Bundeli: **का करें** (kā karen) “What to do?”

2. Bengali dialects:
   - Sylheti: **আমি জাইতাম নি** (ami jaitam ni) “I will not go”
   - Standard Bengali: **আমি যাব না** (ami jabo na) “I will not go”
   - Chittagonian: **আই জুম নাই** (āi jum nāi) “I will not go”

3. Punjabi dialects:
   - Majhi: **ਮੈਂ ਜਾਣਾ** (maiṁ jāṇā) “I will go”
   - Malwai: **ਮੈਂ ਜੂੰ** (maiṁ jūṁ) “I will go”
   - Doabi: **ਮੈਂ ਜਾਊਂ** (maiṁ jāūṁ) “I will go”

4. Marathi dialects:
   - Standard Marathi: **मी जाईन** (mī jāīn) “I will go”
   - Varhadi: **मी जाईल** (mī jāīl) “I will go”
   - Konkani: **हांव वचतलों** (hāṁv vacatalōṁ) “I will go”

5. Bhojpuri dialects:
   - Western Bhojpuri: **हम जाएम** (ham jāem) “I will go”
   - Southern Bhojpuri: **हम जाइब** (ham jāib) “I will go”

These dialectal variations provide valuable insights into historical sound changes, lexical innovations, and grammatical developments within the Indo-Aryan language family.

## Sociolinguistic Aspects

The development and current status of Indo-Aryan languages are deeply influenced by sociolinguistic factors:

1. Diglossia: Many Indo-Aryan languages exhibit a diglossic situation, with a formal, literary variety coexisting with colloquial forms.
   Example: Literary Bengali **kariyāchi** vs. Colloquial **korechi** “I have done”
   Example: Formal Hindi **main jā rahā hūṁ** vs. Colloquial **main jā rahā hūṁ** “I am going”

2. Code-switching: Bilingual speakers often switch between Indo-Aryan languages and English or other local languages.
   Example (Hindi-English): **main office jā rahā hūṁ** “I am going to the office”
   Example (Bengali-English): **āmi office-e jācchi** “I am going to the office”

3. Language standardization: Efforts to standardize languages have led to the development of prestige dialects and official language policies.
   Example: Promotion of Shuddh (Pure) Hindi in India
   Example: Standardization of Bengali by Rabindranath Tagore and others

4. Language contact and convergence: Close contact between Indo-Aryan and non-Indo-Aryan languages has led to the development of linguistic areas with shared features.
   Example: Retroflex consonants shared by Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages
   Example: SOV word order shared across South Asian languages regardless of language family

5. Multilingualism: Many speakers of Indo-Aryan languages are multilingual, often speaking several related languages or dialects.
   Example: A speaker from Bihar might know Hindi, Bhojpuri, and Maithili
   Example: An educated speaker from Maharashtra might know Marathi, Hindi, and English

6. Language prestige: Different Indo-Aryan languages and dialects carry different levels of prestige in various contexts.
   Example: Sanskrit is highly prestigious in religious and academic contexts
   Example: English-Hindi code-switching often carries prestige in urban settings

7. Language policy and politics: Government policies have significant impacts on language use and development.
   Example: The Three Language Formula in Indian education
   Example: The official status of Hindi and English at the national level in India

8. Caste and language: In some regions, language use can be influenced by caste identity.
   Example: Certain vocabulary or pronunciation differences in Hindi based on caste
   Example: Thar Desert dialect continuum showing caste-based variations

9. Urban vs. rural language use: There are often significant differences between urban and rural varieties of Indo-Aryan languages.
   Example: Urban Hindi incorporating more English loanwords
   Example: Rural Bengali retaining more traditional vocabulary and grammatical features

Understanding these sociolinguistic aspects is crucial for a comprehensive study of historical Indo-Aryan linguistics, as they have played a significant role in shaping the development and current state of these languages.

## Phonological Processes in Modern Indo-Aryan Languages

Several phonological processes are common across modern Indo-Aryan languages, although their specific manifestations may vary:

1. Vowel harmony: Some languages exhibit vowel harmony, where vowels in a word agree in certain features.
   Example (Bengali): **śunechilam** “I had heard” vs. **bolechilam** “I had said”

2. Consonant clusters simplification: Many languages simplify consonant clusters, especially at the beginning of words.
   Example (Hindi): Sanskrit **sthāna** > Hindi **thān** “place”

3. Schwa deletion: In many languages, especially Hindi, unstressed schwas are often deleted.
   Example (Hindi): **kamal** [kəməl] > [kməl] “lotus”

4. Nasalization: Vowel nasalization is phonemic in many Indo-Aryan languages.
   Example (Hindi): **hā̃** “yes” vs. **hā** “oh”

5. Assimilation: Consonants often assimilate in voicing or place of articulation.
   Example (Bengali): **āṭ** “eight” + **ṭā** (classifier) > **āṭṭā** “eight pieces”

6. Compensatory lengthening: When a consonant is lost, the preceding vowel may be lengthened.
   Example (Punjabi): OIA **hasta** > Punjabi **hatth** > **hāth** “hand”

7. Tone development: Some languages, like Punjabi and Dogri, have developed tonal distinctions.
   Example (Punjabi): **kóṛā** “whip” (high tone) vs. **kòṛā** “horse” (low tone)

## Grammaticalization Processes

Grammaticalization, the process by which lexical items become grammatical markers, is evident in the historical development of Indo-Aryan languages:

1. Development of postpositions: Many postpositions developed from nouns or verbs.
   Example (Hindi): **ke pās** “near” (lit. “of side”) < Sanskrit **pārśva** “side”

2. Auxiliary verbs: Main verbs grammaticalized into auxiliaries.
   Example (Hindi): **jānā** “to go” as a completive auxiliary in **kar jānā** “to do (completely)”

3. Honorific pronouns: Nouns grammaticalized into honorific pronouns.
   Example (Hindi): **āp** “you (honorific)” < Sanskrit **ātman** “self”

4. Aspectual markers: Verbs grammaticalized into aspectual markers.
   Example (Bengali): **-che** (progressive marker) < **āche** “is”

5. Classifiers: Nouns grammaticalized into numeral classifiers.
   Example (Assamese): **-jon** (human classifier) < Sanskrit **jana** “person”

## Semantic Changes

Semantic changes are an important aspect of the historical development of Indo-Aryan languages:

1. Broadening: Words taking on a more general meaning.
   Example (Hindi): **kapḍā** “cloth” > “clothes” (generally)

2. Narrowing: Words becoming more specific in meaning.
   Example (Bengali): **byādhī** “disease” > “rheumatism” specifically

3. Amelioration: Words gaining a more positive connotation.
   Example (Hindi): **sahī** “tolerated” > “correct, right”

4. Pejoration: Words gaining a more negative connotation.
   Example (Hindi): **caprāsī** “peon” (originally neutral, now somewhat derogatory)

5. Semantic shift: Words changing meaning entirely.
   Example (Hindi): **khalīfā** “caliph” > **khalīfā** “tailor”

## Influence on Non-Indo-Aryan Languages

Indo-Aryan languages have also influenced non-Indo-Aryan languages in the region:

1. Dravidian languages: Many Dravidian languages have borrowed extensively from Sanskrit and other Indo-Aryan languages.
   Example (Telugu): **pustakamu** “book” < Sanskrit **pustaka**

2. Munda languages: Munda languages have borrowed vocabulary and some structural features from Indo-Aryan languages.
   Example (Santali): **rāṇī** “queen” < Sanskrit **rājñī**

3. Tibeto-Burman languages: Languages like Newari have been heavily influenced by Indo-Aryan.
   Example (Newari): **āju** “grandfather” < Sanskrit **āryaputra**

4. Persian: While Persian influenced Indo-Aryan languages, the reverse also occurred, especially in India.
   Example (Persian): **shāl** “shawl” < Sanskrit **śāṭī**

## Computational Approaches to Indo-Aryan Historical Linguistics

Recent years have seen an increase in computational approaches to studying the historical development of Indo-Aryan languages:

1. Phylogenetic methods: Using computational phylogenetics to reconstruct language family trees.

2. Automated cognate detection: Developing algorithms to identify cognates across Indo-Aryan languages.

3. Sound change modeling: Creating computational models of historical sound changes.

4. Corpus-based diachronic studies: Using large-scale textual data to track language change over time.

5. Machine learning approaches to language reconstruction: Applying machine learning techniques to reconstruct proto-forms.

These computational methods, combined with traditional historical linguistic approaches, are providing new insights into the development and relationships of Indo-Aryan languages.

This overview provides a comprehensive look at the historical development of Indo-Aryan languages, covering various linguistic aspects from phonology to semantics, as well as sociolinguistic factors and modern computational approaches. The field of Indo-Aryan historical linguistics continues to evolve, offering rich opportunities for further research and discovery.
