# Guarani

Guarani is a Tupian language spoken by approximately 5-6 million people, primarily in Paraguay, where it is an official language alongside Spanish. It is also spoken in parts of Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil. Guarani is notable for being one of the few indigenous languages of the Americas that is widely spoken by non-indigenous people.

## Phonology

### Vowels

Guarani has 12 vowel phonemes: 6 oral vowels and 6 nasal vowels.

Oral vowels:
| IPA | Orthography |
|-----|-------------|
| /a/ | a |
| /e/ | e |
| /i/ | i |
| /ɨ/ | y |
| /o/ | o |
| /u/ | u |

Nasal vowels:
| IPA | Orthography |
|-----|-------------|
| /ã/ | ã |
| /ẽ/ | ẽ |
| /ĩ/ | ĩ |
| /ɨ̃/ | ỹ |
| /õ/ | õ |
| /ũ/ | ũ |

Examples:
- **ava** [ava] “man”
- **yvy** [ɨvɨ] “earth”
- **kãguy** [kãɡuɨ] “forest”

### Consonants

Guarani has 19 consonant phonemes:

| IPA | Orthography |
|-----|-------------|
| /p/ | p |
| /b/ | b |
| /t/ | t |
| /d/ | d |
| /k/ | k |
| /ɡ/ | g |
| /ʔ/ | ' |
| /m̥/ | m |
| /m/ | mb |

| /n/ | nd |
| /ɲ̥/ | ñ |
| /ɲ/ | nj |
| /ŋ̥/ | g̃ |
| /ŋ/ | ng |
| /tʃ/ | ch |
| /dʒ/ | j |
| /s/ | s |

Examples:
- **popo** [popo] “to jump”
- **mba'e** [mbaʔe] “thing”
- **ñandu** [ɲandu] “spider”
- **jaguarete** [dʒaɡwaɾete] “jaguar”

### Phonological processes

1. Nasalization: Vowels become nasalized when adjacent to nasal consonants or nasal vowels.
   Example: **omano** [õmãnõ] “he/she died”

2. Voicing assimilation: Voiceless consonants become voiced when following nasal vowels.
   Example: **kã + puku** → **kãmbuku** [kãmbuku] “long bone”

3. Vowel harmony: In some dialects, there is a tendency for vowels within a word to share similar features.
   Example: **ojeroky** [odʒeɾokɨ] → **ojoroko** [odʒoɾoko] “he/she dances”

## Orthography

Guarani uses a Latin-based alphabet with some additional characters. The standard orthography includes:

a, ã, b, ch, d, e, ẽ, g, g̃, h, i, ĩ, j, k, l, m, mb, n, nd, ng, ñ, o, õ, p, r, rr, s, t, u, ũ, v, y, ỹ, '

Some notes on orthography:

- The apostrophe (') represents the glottal stop /ʔ/.
- The tilde (~) over vowels indicates nasalization.
- The letter “y” represents the high central vowel /ɨ/.
- “g̃” represents the velar nasal /ŋ̥/.

## Morphology

Guarani is a polysynthetic language with a rich system of affixes and clitics.

### Nouns

Nouns in Guarani do not inflect for gender or case. However, they can take various affixes for number, possession, and other grammatical functions.

1. Plural marking:
   The suffix **-kuéra** is used to indicate plurality, but it's not obligatory when the plural meaning is clear from context.
   Example: **ava** “man” → **avakuéra** “men”

2. Possession:
   Possessive prefixes are added to nouns to indicate ownership.
   
   | Person | Prefix |
   |--------|--------|
   | 1sg    | che-   |
   | 2sg    | nde-   |
   | 3sg    | i-/h-  |
   | 1pl.incl | ñande- |
   | 1pl.excl | ore-   |
   | 2pl    | pende- |
   | 3pl    | i-/h-  |

   Example: 
   - **che-róga** “my house”
   - **nde-róga** “your house”
   - **h-óga** “his/her house”

3. Relational prefixes:
   Some nouns use relational prefixes when possessed. The most common are **t-** (non-possessed), **r-** (possessed), and **h-** (3rd person possession).
   
   Example:
   - **t-esa** “eye” (general)
   - **che-r-esa** “my eye”
   - **h-esa** “his/her eye”

### Verbs

Guarani verbs are highly complex, with numerous affixes for person, tense, aspect, mood, and other grammatical categories.

1. Person marking:
   Verbs are marked for subject (and sometimes object) using prefixes.

   Active verbs (transitive and intransitive):
   | Person | Prefix |
   |--------|--------|
   | 1sg    | a-     |
   | 2sg    | re-    |
   | 3sg    | o-     |
   | 1pl.incl | ja-    |
   | 1pl.excl | ro-    |
   | 2pl    | pe-    |
   | 3pl    | o-     |

   Example with **-guata** “to walk”:
   - **a-guata** “I walk”
   - **re-guata** “you walk”
   - **o-guata** “he/she walks”

   Inactive verbs (stative):
   | Person | Prefix |
   |--------|--------|
   | 1sg    | che-   |
   | 2sg    | nde-   |
   | 3sg    | i-/h-  |
   | 1pl.incl | ñande- |
   | 1pl.excl | ore-   |
   | 2pl    | pende- |
   | 3pl    | i-/h-  |

   Example with **-kane'õ** “to be tired”:
   - **che-kane'õ** “I am tired”
   - **nde-kane'õ** “you are tired”
   - **i-kane'õ** “he/she is tired”

2. Tense and aspect:
   Guarani uses various suffixes and particles to indicate tense and aspect.

   - Present: unmarked
     Example: **a-guata** “I walk”

   - Past: **-kuri** (recent past), **-va'ekue** (remote past)
     Example: **a-guata-kuri** “I walked (recently)”

   - Future: **-ta**
     Example: **a-guata-ta** “I will walk”

   - Progressive: **-ina**
     Example: **a-guata-ina** “I am walking”

   - Completive: **-pa**
     Example: **a-guata-pa** “I finished walking”

3. Mood:
   Various suffixes and particles express mood.

   - Imperative: **e-** (2sg), **pe-** (2pl)
     Example: **e-guata** “walk!” (to one person)

   - Optative: **-se**
     Example: **a-guata-se** “I want to walk”

   - Conditional: **-ramo**
     Example: **a-guata-ramo** “if I walk”

4. Negation:
   Verbs are negated using the circumfix **nd(a)-...-i**.
   Example: **nda-guata-i** “I don’t walk”

### Adjectives

In Guarani, many concepts that are expressed as adjectives in other languages are expressed as stative verbs. However, there are also true adjectives that can modify nouns directly.

Examples of stative verbs used as adjectives:
- **i-porã** “it is beautiful”
- **h-asy** “it is difficult”

Examples of true adjectives:
- **tuicha** “big”
- **michĩ** “small”

Adjectives generally follow the noun they modify:
- **óga tuicha** “big house”

### Adverbs

Adverbs in Guarani can be formed from adjectives or stative verbs by adding the suffix **-hápe**.

Example:
- **porã** “good” → **porãhápe** “well”
- **i-pya'e** “it is fast” → **pya'ehápe** “quickly”

## Syntax

Guarani has a relatively flexible word order, but the most common order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

1. Basic sentence structure:
   **Juan pelota o-mbo'i** 
   Juan ball 3sg-throw
   “Juan throws the ball”

2. Questions:
   Questions are typically formed by adding the particle **-pa** at the end of the sentence or by using question words.

   Yes/no question:
   **Re-guata-ta-pa**
   2sg-walk-FUT-Q
   “Will you walk?”

   Wh-question:
   **Mba'e re-japo**
   what 2sg-do
   “What are you doing?”

3. Relative clauses:
   Relative clauses are formed using the particle **-va**.

   **Ava o-guata-va**
   man 3sg-walk-REL
   “The man who walks”

4. Subordinate clauses:
   Various particles and suffixes are used to form subordinate clauses.

   - **-ramo** (conditional):
     **A-guata-ramo, che-kane'õ-ta**
     1sg-walk-COND 1sg-tired-FUT
     “If I walk, I will be tired”

   - **-gui** (causal):
     **Nda-guata-i-gui, nache-kane'õi**
     NEG-1sg-walk-NEG-CAUS NEG-1sg-tired-NEG
     “Because I don’t walk, I'm not tired”

5. Serial verb constructions:
   Guarani allows multiple verbs to be strung together to express complex actions.

   **A-guata a-ju**
   1sg-walk 1sg-come
   “I come walking”

## Vocabulary

Guarani vocabulary is primarily of Tupian origin, but it has also borrowed extensively from Spanish due to centuries of contact.

## Dialectal variation

While Paraguayan Guarani is the most widely spoken and standardized variety, there are several other dialects and closely related languages:

In modern usage, Spanish numbers are often used for higher values.

## Verbal Voice and Valency

Guarani has several mechanisms to adjust verbal valency:

1. Causative:
