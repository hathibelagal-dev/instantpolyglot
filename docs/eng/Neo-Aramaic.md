# Neo-Aramaic

Neo-Aramaic refers to a group of modern Aramaic languages that descended from Middle Aramaic dialects. These languages are spoken by various communities across the Middle East, including Assyrians, Chaldeans, Syriac Christians, and some Jewish communities. The number of speakers is estimated to be around 500,000 to 1 million, with most languages being endangered due to political instability, migration, and language shift.

## Classification

Neo-Aramaic languages belong to the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. They can be broadly divided into several groups:

1. Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA)
   - Includes languages such as Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, and Jewish Northeastern Neo-Aramaic
2. Central Neo-Aramaic
   - Includes Turoyo and Mlahso
3. Western Neo-Aramaic
   - Spoken in three villages near Damascus, Syria
4. Mandaic
   - Spoken by the Mandaean community in Iran and diaspora
5. Neo-Syriac
   - Includes Classical Syriac and its modern descendants

This overview will primarily focus on Northeastern Neo-Aramaic, as it includes the most widely spoken varieties.

## Phonology

### Consonants

NENA languages typically have a rich consonant inventory. Here's a general overview of consonants found in many NENA varieties:

| Manner | Labial | Dental/Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Pharyngeal | Glottal |
|--------|--------|-----------------|---------|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| Plosive | p b | t d | | k g | q | | ʔ |
| Fricative | f v | s z | ʃ ʒ | x ɣ | | ħ ʕ | h |
| Affricate | | t͡s d͡z | t͡ʃ d͡ʒ | | | | |
| Nasal | m | n | | | | | |
| Trill | | r | | | | | |
| Approximant | w | l | j | | | | |

Note that individual NENA languages may have slight variations in their consonant inventories. For example:

- Some dialects preserve historical emphatic consonants (ṭ, ṣ, q), while others have merged them with their non-emphatic counterparts.
- The pharyngeal fricatives /ħ/ and /ʕ/ may be lost or realized differently in some dialects.
- The uvular stop /q/ may be realized as a velar [k] or glottal [ʔ] in some varieties.

Examples of minimal pairs illustrating consonant contrasts:

**pata** “width” vs. **bata** “houses”
**tara** “door” vs. **dara** “generation”
**kapa** “stone” vs. **gaba** “side”
**sama** “poison” vs. **zama** “time”
**šata** “year” vs. **žala** “young man”
**xala** “aunt” vs. **ɣala** “mistake”

### Vowels

Most NENA languages have a relatively simple vowel system, typically consisting of:

| Front | Central | Back |
|-------|---------|------|
| i     | ə       | u    |
| e     | a       | o    |

Some languages may also have long vowels, represented by doubling the vowel letter: aa, ii, uu, etc. The exact realization of vowels can vary among dialects. For example:

- The historical *ā vowel is realized as [ɑ] in some dialects, but as [o] or [u] in others.
- Some dialects have developed additional vowel phonemes through loanwords or sound changes.

Examples of minimal pairs illustrating vowel contrasts:

**bera** “well, pit” vs. **bara** “outside”
**šima** “name” vs. **šema** “he heard”
**guda** “wall” vs. **gora** “man”

### Stress

Stress patterns can vary among NENA languages, but many follow a penultimate stress rule. For example:

**ˈbrata** “daughter”
**šəmˈmana** “fat”
**mšadˈdana** “sender”

However, there are exceptions and variations:

- Some words have final stress: **kteˈwa** “he was writing”
- Stress can shift with the addition of suffixes: **ˈgora** “man” → **goˈraha** “her man”
- Some dialects have developed tonal distinctions that interact with stress

### Phonological processes

1. Vowel reduction: Unstressed vowels often reduce to schwa [ə].
   Example: **ˈbrata** “daughter” → **brəˈtata** “her daughter”
             **ˈgora** “man” → **gəˈraha** “her man”

2. Consonant assimilation: Adjacent consonants may assimilate in voicing or place of articulation.
   Example: **ˈxəmša** “five” + **-ta** → **xəmšˈta** “fifth (f.)”
             **ˈšabta** “Saturday” + **-ta** → **šabətta** “the following Saturday”

3. Syncope: Unstressed vowels may be deleted in certain environments.
   Example: **ˈgora** “man” + **-e** → **gˈre** “men”
             **ˈkalba** “dog” + **-e** → **kalˈbe** “dogs”

4. Epenthesis: In some dialects, a vowel may be inserted to break up consonant clusters.
   Example: **ˈšimša** “sun” → **šiˈməmša** “suns”

5. Final devoicing: In some dialects, voiced obstruents are devoiced word-finally.
   Example: **ˈguda** “wall” → **gut** (in isolation or before a voiceless consonant)

6. Pharyngealization spread: In dialects that preserve emphatic consonants, the pharyngealization can spread to neighboring segments.
   Example: **ṭaˈra** “door” may be realized as [tˤɑˈrˤɑ] with pharyngealization affecting both vowels

## Morphology

Neo-Aramaic languages are highly inflectional, with complex systems of prefixes and suffixes used to convey grammatical information.

### Nouns

Nouns in NENA languages are marked for:

1. Gender: masculine and feminine
2. Number: singular and plural
3. State: absolute, construct, and emphatic

Example paradigm for **brata** “daughter”:

| | Singular | Plural |
|-|----------|--------|
| Absolute | **brat** | **bnat** |
| Construct | **brat** | **bnat** |
| Emphatic | **brata** | **bnate** |

Note: The emphatic state is the default form for most nouns in modern usage.

Additional examples:

**gora** “man” (m.)
- Plural: **gure**
- Construct: **gor**

**beta** “house” (m.)
- Plural: **bate**
- Construct: **bet**

**šəmša** “sun” (f.)
- Plural: **šəmše**
- Construct: **šəmš**

#### Irregular plurals

Some nouns have irregular plural forms:

**bron** “son” → **bnone** “sons”
**xmara** “donkey” → **xmare** “donkeys”
**yoma** “day” → **yomane** “days”

#### Possession

Possession is typically expressed through suffixes:

**brat-i** “my daughter”
**brat-ox** “your (m.sg.) daughter”
**brat-ax** “your (f.sg.) daughter”
**brat-e** “his daughter”
**brat-o** “her daughter”
**brat-an** “our daughter”
**brat-oxun** “your (pl.) daughter”
**brat-ehun** “their daughter”

These suffixes can also be used with prepositions:

**əll-i** “to me”
**əmm-ox** “with you (m.sg.)”
**mənn-a** “from her”

### Adjectives

Adjectives agree with nouns in gender and number:

**gora raba** “big man”
**brata rabta** “big daughter”
**gure rabe** “big men”
**bnate rabate** “big daughters”

Some adjectives have irregular feminine or plural forms:

**xwara** “white” (m.) → **xwarta** “white” (f.)
**smoka** “red” (m.) → **smokta** “red” (f.)
**basima** “pleasant” (m.) → **basimta** “pleasant” (f.)

Comparative and superlative forms are usually formed analytically:

**bəš raba** “bigger” (lit. “more big”)
**bəš raba mən kul** “biggest” (lit. “more big than all”)

However, some adjectives have suppletive comparative forms:

**ṭawa** “good” → **ṭawtera** “better”
**biša** “bad” → **bištera** “worse”

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **ana** | **axnan** |
| 2m | **at** | **axtun** |
| 2f | **at** | **axten** |
| 3m | **awa** | **ani** |
| 3f | **aya** | **ani** |

Demonstrative pronouns:

| | Singular | Plural |
|-|----------|--------|
| Near | **aha** (m), **aha** (f) | **ani** |
| Far | **awa** (m), **aya** (f) | **ani** |

Interrogative pronouns:

**mani** “who”
**mudi** “what”
**ema** “where”
**eyma** “when”
**dax** “how”
**qamu** “why”

Relative pronoun:

**d-** (indeclinable)

Example: **gora d-xzeli** “the man whom I saw”

Reflexive pronouns:

**gyan-** + possessive suffix

Example: **gyan-i** “myself”, **gyan-ox** “yourself (m.sg.)”

Reciprocal pronoun:

**xdade** “each other”

Example: **xzelu xdade** “they saw each other”

### Verbs

Verbs in NENA languages have a complex morphology, with different stems for different aspects and moods. The basic structure of a verb form is:

(subject prefix) - TAM prefix - stem - (object suffix)

Where TAM stands for Tense-Aspect-Mood.

#### Present base

Example paradigm for **p-t-x** “to open”:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **k-patx-ən** | **k-patx-ax** |
| 2m | **k-patx-ət** | **k-patx-itun** |
| 2f | **k-patx-at** | **k-patx-itən** |
| 3m | **k-patəx** | **k-patx-i** |
| 3f | **k-patx-a** | **k-patx-i** |

The **k-** prefix indicates present tense. Some dialects use **g-** or **q-** instead.

#### Past base

Example paradigm for **p-t-x** “to open”:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **ptəx-li** | **ptəx-lan** |
| 2m | **ptəx-lux** | **ptəx-litun** |
| 2f | **ptəx-lax** | **ptəx-litən** |
| 3m | **ptəx-lə** | **ptəx-lun** |
| 3f | **ptəx-la** | **ptəx-lun** |

Note the use of L-suffixes to mark the subject in the past tense.

#### Imperative

Singular: **ptox**
Plural: **ptoxun**

#### Infinitive

**ptaxa**

#### Participles

Active participle: **patəx** (m), **patəxta** (f)
Passive participle: **ptixa** (m), **ptixta** (f)

#### Verbal nouns

**ptaxa** “opening”

#### Object suffixes

Object suffixes can be added to verb forms:

**xze-li** “I saw”
**xze-li-lux** “I saw you (m.sg.)”
**xze-li-la** “I saw her”

#### Compound tenses

Perfect: participle + enclitic pronouns
**ptixa-yen** “I have opened”
**ptixa-yət** “you (m.sg.) have opened”
**ptixa-yle** “he has opened”

Progressive: present participle + auxiliary **ywa**
**patəx ywen** “I am opening”
**patəxta ywa** “she is opening”

#### Derived stems

NENA languages have several derived verbal stems, including:

1. Causative: often formed with **m-** prefix
   **ylp** “to learn” → **mylp** “to teach”

2. Passive: often formed with internal vowel change and **-y-** infix
   **qtl** “to kill” → **qtil** “to be killed”

3. Reciprocal/Reflexive: often formed with **m-t-** prefix
   **xze** “to see” → **mxuze** “to see each other”

4. Intensive: often formed by doubling the middle radical
   **ptx** “to open” → **pttx** “to open wide”

### Derivational morphology

NENA languages have several productive ways to derive new words:

1. Verbal nouns: **ptaxa** “opening” from **p-t-x** “to open”
2. Agentive nouns: **patəxana** “opener” from **p-t-x** “to open”
3. Diminutives: **kalba** “dog” → **kalbona** “little dog”
4. Abstract nouns: **xwara** “white” → **xwaruta** “whiteness”
5. Adjectives from nouns: **šəmša** “sun” → **šəmšaya** “solar”

## Syntax

### Word order

The basic word order in NENA languages is typically SVO (Subject-Verb-Object):

**Dawid xzele kalba.**
“David saw the dog.”

However, other word orders are possible for emphasis or in specific constructions:

**Kalba xzele Dawid.** (OVS)
“It was the dog that David saw.”

**Xzele Dawid kalba.** (VSO)
“David saw the dog.” (with focus on the action)

### Agreement

Verbs agree with their subjects in person, number, and gender:

**brata zəlla.**
“The daughter went.”

**bnate zəllun.**
“The daughters went.”

**ana k-azən.**
“I go.”

**axnan k-azax.**
“We go.”

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed with the particle **la** before the verb:

**la zəlli.**
“I didn't go.”

**la k-yəʿən.**
“I don’t know.”

In some dialects, a circumfix **la-...-la** is used for emphasis:

**la-zəlli-la.**
“I absolutely didn't go.”

### Questions

Yes/no questions are often formed by intonation alone:

**zəllux?**
“Did you go?”

Alternatively, some dialects use question particles:

**ki zəllux?**
“Did you go?”

Wh-questions use interrogative words:

**mani zəlle?**
“Who went?”

**ema zəllux?**
“Where did you go?”

**qamu la-teli?**
“Why didn't he come?”

**eyma bet-atət?**
“When will you come?”

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses are typically introduced by the particle **d-**:

**gora d-xzeli ətmol**
“The man whom I saw yesterday”

**beta d-bneli abuki**
“The house that your father built”

In some dialects, the relative particle may be omitted, especially in spoken language:

**gora xzeli ətmol**
“The man (whom) I saw yesterday”

### Copular sentences

In the present tense, copular sentences often use a zero copula:

**Dawid raba.**
“David (is) big.”

**Ana malləpana.**
“I (am) a teacher.”

In other tenses, forms of the verb **h-w-y** “to be” are used:

**Dawid wewa raba.**
“David was big.”

**Ana bet-hawən malləpana.**
“I will be a teacher.”

### Possession

Possession can be expressed in several ways:

1. Using the preposition **d-**:
   **beta d-abuki**
   “your father's house” (lit. “house of your father”)

2. Using the construct state:
   **bet-abuki**
   “your father's house”

3. Using possessive suffixes:
   **bet-i**
   “my house”

4. Using the verb **it** “there is” with possessive suffixes:
   **it-li xmara.**
   “I have a donkey.” (lit. “there is to me a donkey”)

### Causatives

Causatives can be formed in several ways:

1. Using the causative stem (as mentioned in the morphology section):
   **ylp** “to learn” → **mylp** “to teach”

2. Using the verb **šbq** “to leave, allow”:
   **šbəqli d-azəl.**
   “I let him go.” (lit. “I allowed that he goes”)

3. Using the verb **ʿbd** “to make, do”:
   **ʿbədle d-ʾabi.**
   “He made me cry.” (lit. “He made that I cry”)

### Conditionals

Conditional sentences typically use the particle **ən** “if”:

**ən atət, bet-xazənnux.**
“If you come, I will see you.”

Counterfactual conditionals often use the past tense or the perfect:

**ən teli-wa, xzeli-wa-le.**
“If he had come, I would have seen him.”

### Complement clauses

Complement clauses are often introduced by the particle **d-**:

**k-baʿən d-atət.**
“I want you to come.” (lit. “I want that you come”)

**k-xəšwən d-la bet-aze.**
“I think that he won’t go.”

Some verbs can take direct complements without a complementizer:

**k-baʿən azən.**
“I want to go.”

### Coordination

Coordination is typically expressed with the conjunction **u** “and”:

**Dawid u Maryam**
“David and Mary”

**zəlle u tele**
“He went and came”

The disjunctive conjunction is typically **yan** “or”:

**Dawid yan Maryam**
“David or Mary”

### Adverbial clauses

Various conjunctions are used to introduce adverbial clauses:

**kad** “when, while”:
**kad teli, xzeli-le.**
“When he came, I saw him.”

**măṭu** “because”:
**la-teli măṭu mariʿ-wa.**
“He didn't come because he was sick.”

**hal-d** “until”:
**mpele hal-d teli abuki.**
“He waited until your father came.”

## Dialectal variation

Neo-Aramaic languages show significant dialectal variation. Some notable differences include:

1. Phonology:
   - Some dialects preserve the historical emphatic consonants (ṭ, ṣ, q), while others have merged them with their non-emphatic counterparts.
   - The realization of the historical *ā vowel varies: some dialects preserve it as [ɑ], while others have shifted it to [o] or [u].
   - The presence or absence of pharyngeal consonants (ħ, ʕ) varies among dialects.

2. Morphology:
   - The form of the present tense marker varies: **k-** in some dialects, **g-** or **q-** in others.
   - Some dialects have lost the feminine plural forms in verbs and pronouns, using masculine forms for all plurals.
   - The exact form of personal pronouns and demonstratives can vary.

3. Syntax:
   - The use of the construct state varies among dialects, with some preserving it more robustly than others.
   - The position of object pronouns (proclitic vs. enclitic) can differ among dialects.
   - Some dialects have developed innovations like differential object marking.

4. Lexicon:
   - Dialects vary in their retention of native Aramaic vocabulary versus adoption of loanwords.
   - The sources and extent of borrowing can differ significantly among dialects based on their geographic location and contact languages.

Example of dialectal variation:

“I am going to the house”

Urmi dialect: **ana g-azən ga beta**
Alqosh dialect: **ana k-azən ṭal beta**
Jewish Zakho dialect: **ana k-ezin ṭla beθa**

## Writing systems

Neo-Aramaic languages are written in several scripts, depending on the community and tradition:

1. Syriac script (most common):
   a. Eastern (Madnḥāyā) variant:
      ܒܪܵܬܵܐ (brata) “daughter”
   b. Western (Serṭā) variant:
      ܒܪܬܐ (brata) “daughter”

2. Hebrew script (used by some Jewish Neo-Aramaic speakers):
   בראתא (brata) “daughter”

3. Latin script (used in some modern publications and online):
   brata “daughter”

The choice of script often reflects religious and cultural affiliations of the speakers.

## Sample texts

Here are some sample texts in different Neo-Aramaic varieties to illustrate the diversity of the language:

1. Urmia dialect (NENA):

ܚܲܕ ܝܵܘܡܵܐ܄ ܙܹܐܠܹܗ ܚܲܕ ܓܵܒ݂ܪܵܐ ܠܫܘܼܩܵܐ ܩܵܐ ܙܵܒ݂ܘܼܢܹܐ ܐܲܟ݂ܠܵܐ܂ ܒܲܕ ܡܲܛܝܹܐ ܠܹܗ܄ ܚܙܹܐܠܹܗ ܪܵܒܵܐ ܐ݇ܢܵܫܹ̈ܐ ܘܝܼܬܒܹܐ ܝܗ݇ܘܵܘ ܓܵܘ ܚܲܕ ܒܲܝܬܵܐ܂ ܩܘܼܪܒܹܢܹܗ ܘܫܘܼܐܹܠܹܗ܄ ܡܵܢܝܼ ܝܬܘܿܢ ܐܲܚܬܘܿܢ؟ ܘܡܘܼܓ̰ܘܼܒܠܗ݇ܘܿܢ܄ ܐܲܚܢܲܢ ܝܘܲܚ ܡܲܠܲܐܟܹ̈ܐ ܕܐܲܠܵܗܵܐ܂

Xa yoma, zelle xa gavra l-šuqa qa zavune axla. Bad maṭyele, xzele raba naše w-yitve ʾva gaw xa beta. Qurbene w-šuʾele, mani ʾiton axton? W-mujəbləhon, axnan ʾivax malaxe d-alaha.

“One day, a man went to the market to buy food. When he arrived, he saw many people sitting in a house. He approached and asked, 'Who are you?' And they answered, 'We are angels of God.'”

2. Jewish Zakho dialect (NENA, in Hebrew script):

חד יומא, זיללה חא גברא לשוקא קא זבוני אוכלא. כד מטילה, חזילה רבא נשה ויתבה הוו גו חא ביתא. קרבלה ושואללה, מני יתון אחתון? ומוג׳בלהון, אחנן יוח מלאכה דאלהא.

Xa yoma, zille xa gawra l-šuqa qa zwone oxla. Kad mṭele, xzele raba niše w-yitwewa go xa beta. Qərbele w-šuʾəlle, mani ʾiton axton? U-mujəwlun, axnan yux malaxe d-alaha.

3. Turoyo (Central Neo-Aramaic):

Ḥa-yawmo, azzé ḥa-zlām l-šūqo l-zaḇōne mēkūlto. Kad mōṭe, ḥzēle kṯīre nōše d-yōṯīwele gaw ḥa-bayto. Qərwe u-šaʾəlle, man-iḥat? U-mjāwəblē, aḥna-yna malāḥe d-alōho.

4. Western Neo-Aramaic:

Ḥa-yōma, zal ḥa-gaḇra l-šūqa l-zeḇāne ʾuḵla. Kad maṭi, ḥza saggi-nāša d-yāṯḇin b-ḥa-bayta. Qreḇ u-šāʾel-lon, man-atton? W-ʾāmrin-le, naḥna malaʾḵe d-alāha.

These sample texts demonstrate the similarities and differences among Neo-Aramaic varieties, showing how they have evolved from their common Aramaic roots while developing unique features.
