# Azerbaijani

Azerbaijani, also known as Azeri, is a Turkic language spoken primarily in Azerbaijan and northwestern Iran. It is closely related to Turkish and has approximately 30 million speakers worldwide. The language is the official language of Azerbaijan and is recognized as a minority language in several other countries.

## Alphabet and Pronunciation

Azerbaijani uses a modified Latin alphabet, which was officially adopted in 1991 after Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union. Prior to this, the language used Cyrillic and Arabic scripts at different points in history.

### Pronunciation Rules

1. Vowel Harmony: Azerbaijani exhibits vowel harmony, where suffixes change their vowels to match the last vowel of the root word. There are two types of vowel harmony:

   a) Front/Back Harmony:
   Front vowels: e, ə, i, ö, ü
   Back vowels: a, ı, o, u

   Example:
   **ev** (house) + locative suffix → **evdə** (at home)
   **kitab** (book) + locative suffix → **kitabda** (in the book)

   b) Rounded/Unrounded Harmony:
   Rounded vowels: o, ö, u, ü
   Unrounded vowels: a, e, ə, ı, i

   Example:
   **göz** (eye) + plural suffix → **gözlər** (eyes)
   **qız** (girl) + plural suffix → **qızlar** (girls)

2. Consonant Assimilation: When certain consonants come together, one may change to match the other in voicing.

   Example:
   **kitab** (book) + **da** (locative suffix) → **kitabda** (in the book)
   **ağac** (tree) + **da** (locative suffix) → **ağacda** (in/on the tree)

3. Final Devoicing: Voiced consonants at the end of words are often devoiced in spoken Azerbaijani.

   Example:
   **kitab** [kitap] (book)
   **ağac** [aɣatʃ] (tree)

4. The letter 'ğ' is often silent between vowels and at the end of words, lengthening the preceding vowel.

   Example:
   **dağ** [da:] (mountain)
   **ağac** [a:dʒ] (tree)

## Morphology

Azerbaijani is an agglutinative language, meaning that grammatical functions are expressed by adding suffixes to word stems.

### Nouns

Nouns in Azerbaijani do not have grammatical gender. They are inflected for number, case, and possession.

#### Number

The plural is formed by adding the suffix **-lar** or **-lər** (depending on vowel harmony):

- **kitab** (book) → **kitablar** (books)
- **ev** (house) → **evlər** (houses)

#### Case

Azerbaijani has six cases:

1. Nominative (unmarked): **kitab** (book)
2. Genitive: **kitabın** (of the book)
3. Dative: **kitaba** (to the book)
4. Accusative: **kitabı** (the book, as direct object)
5. Locative: **kitabda** (in the book)
6. Ablative: **kitabdan** (from the book)

Example declension of **ev** (house):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | ev | evlər |
| Genitive | evin | evlərin |
| Dative | evə | evlərə |
| Accusative | evi | evləri |
| Locative | evdə | evlərdə |
| Ablative | evdən | evlərdən |

#### Possession

Possessive suffixes are added to nouns to indicate ownership:

- **kitabım** (my book)
- **kitabın** (your book)
- **kitabı** (his/her book)
- **kitabımız** (our book)
- **kitabınız** (your book, plural)
- **kitabları** (their book)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Azerbaijani are not inflected and typically precede the noun they modify:

- **böyük ev** (big house)
- **gözəl qız** (beautiful girl)

Comparative and superlative forms are created using the words **daha** (more) and **ən** (most):

- **böyük** (big) → **daha böyük** (bigger) → **ən böyük** (biggest)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Azerbaijani:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | mən | biz |
| 2nd | sən | siz |
| 3rd | o | onlar |

Demonstrative pronouns:

- **bu** (this)
- **o** (that)
- **bunlar** (these)
- **onlar** (those)

Interrogative pronouns:

- **kim** (who)
- **nə** (what)
- **hansı** (which)
- **neçə** (how many)

### Verbs

Azerbaijani verbs are highly regular and are conjugated for tense, aspect, mood, and person.

#### Infinitive

The infinitive form of verbs ends in **-maq** or **-mək**:

- **yazmaq** (to write)
- **gəlmək** (to come)

#### Present Tense

The present tense is formed by adding personal endings to the verb stem:

**yazmaq** (to write):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | yazıram | yazırıq |
| 2nd | yazırsan | yazırsınız |
| 3rd | yazır | yazırlar |

#### Past Tense

Azerbaijani has several past tenses. The most common is the definite past, formed by adding **-dı**, **-di**, **-du**, or **-dü** (depending on vowel harmony) to the verb stem, followed by personal endings:

**yazmaq** (to write):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | yazdım | yazdıq |
| 2nd | yazdın | yazdınız |
| 3rd | yazdı | yazdılar |

#### Future Tense

The future tense is formed by adding **-acaq** or **-əcək** to the verb stem, followed by personal endings:

**yazmaq** (to write):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | yazacağam | yazacağıq |
| 2nd | yazacaqsan | yazacaqsınız |
| 3rd | yazacaq | yazacaqlar |

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed by using the verb stem for the singular and adding **-ın** or **-in** for the plural:

- **yaz** (write!)
- **yazın** (write! - plural)

#### Negation

Verbs are negated by adding **-ma** or **-mə** to the verb stem before other suffixes:

- **yazmıram** (I am not writing)
- **yazmadım** (I did not write)

#### Passive Voice

The passive voice is formed by adding **-ıl**, **-il**, **-ul**, or **-ül** to the verb stem:

- **yazmaq** (to write) → **yazılmaq** (to be written)

### Postpositions

Azerbaijani uses postpositions instead of prepositions. These follow the noun they modify:

- **evin içində** (inside the house)
- **məktəbə görə** (according to the school)

## Syntax

Azerbaijani typically follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, although other orders are possible for emphasis:

- **Mən kitab oxuyuram.** (I book read. - I am reading a book.)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the particle **-mı** (with variants **-mi**, **-mu**, **-mü** according to vowel harmony) to the end of the sentence:

- **Sən Bakıda yaşayırsan?** (Do you live in Baku?)
- **O, kitab oxuyurmu?** (Is he/she reading a book?)

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns or adverbs:

- **Sən nə oxuyursan?** (What are you reading?)
- **O hara gedir?** (Where is he/she going?)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Azerbaijani precede the noun they modify and use participles:

- **oxuduğum kitab** (the book that I read)
- **gələn adam** (the person who is coming)

## Vocabulary

Azerbaijani vocabulary has been influenced by various languages throughout its history, including:

1. Arabic and Persian: due to Islamic influence
   Example: **kitab** (book, from Arabic)

2. Russian: due to historical Soviet influence
   Example: **zavod** (factory, from Russian)

3. Turkish: due to linguistic and cultural proximity
   Example: **çanta** (bag, shared with Turkish)

4. English: especially in modern technology and international terms
   Example: **kompüter** (computer)

Many Turkic roots are shared across Azerbaijani and other Turkic languages, which can be helpful for learners familiar with languages like Turkish or Uzbek.

### Common Phrases

- **Salam** (Hello)
- **Sağ ol** (Thank you)
- **Necəsən?** (How are you?)
- **Yaxşıyam** (I'm fine)
- **Xahiş edirəm** (Please)

## Dialects

Azerbaijani has several dialects, which can be broadly categorized into:

1. Northern dialects (spoken in the Republic of Azerbaijan)
2. Southern dialects (spoken in Iran)
3. Eastern dialects (spoken in some parts of the Caucasus)
4. Western dialects (spoken in eastern Turkey)

The standard language is based on the dialect of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. There are some differences in pronunciation, vocabulary, and even grammar between these dialects, but they are generally mutually intelligible.

## Colloquial Language

Colloquial Azerbaijani may differ from the standard written language in several ways:

1. Contraction of words:
   **nə edim** → **neynim** (what should I do)

2. Omission of certain sounds:
   **gəlirəm** → **gəlirəm** (I'm coming)

3. Use of Russian loanwords (especially in the Republic of Azerbaijan):
   **mağaza** (standard) → **magazin** (colloquial, from Russian) (store)

4. Different pronoun usage:
   **biz** (we) → **bizlər** (emphatic "we")

5. Simplified verb forms:
   **gedəcəyəm** (I will go) → **gedəcəm** (colloquial form)

6. Use of particles for emphasis:
   **də/da** - **Mən də gəlirəm** (I'm coming too)

## Idiomatic Expressions

Azerbaijani, like many languages, has a rich collection of idiomatic expressions. Here are a few examples:

1. **Gözüm üstə** (On my eye) - Meaning: "Certainly" or "With pleasure"

2. **Başa düşmək** (To fall on the head) - Meaning: "To understand"

3. **Ürəyinə dəymək** (To touch someone's heart) - Meaning: "To offend someone"

4. **Gözdən pərdə asmaq** (To hang a curtain over the eyes) - Meaning: "To deceive"

5. **Qulaq asmaq** (To hang an ear) - Meaning: "To listen"

6. **Dil tökmək** (To pour language) - Meaning: "To try to persuade someone"

## Phonological Processes

### Vowel Harmony

As mentioned earlier, Azerbaijani exhibits vowel harmony. This process extends to most suffixes, which change their vowels to match the last vowel of the root word. There are two types of vowel harmony:

1. Front/Back Harmony:
   - Front vowels: e, ə, i, ö, ü
   - Back vowels: a, ı, o, u

   Example:
   **ev** (house) + locative suffix → **evdə** (at home)
   **yol** (road) + locative suffix → **yolda** (on the road)

2. Rounded/Unrounded Harmony:
   - Rounded vowels: o, ö, u, ü
   - Unrounded vowels: a, e, ə, ı, i

   Example:
   **göl** (lake) + plural suffix → **göllər** (lakes)
   **dağ** (mountain) + plural suffix → **dağlar** (mountains)

### Consonant Assimilation

When certain consonants come together at morpheme boundaries, one may change to match the other in voicing. This process is called consonant assimilation.

1. Progressive assimilation:
   **ağac** (tree) + **da** (locative suffix) → **ağacda** [aɣadʒda]

2. Regressive assimilation:
   **süd** (milk) + **dən** (ablative suffix) → **süddən** [syddæn]

### Final Devoicing

In spoken Azerbaijani, voiced consonants at the end of words are often devoiced:

- **kitab** [kitap] (book)
- **ağac** [aɣatʃ] (tree)

This process is not reflected in the orthography but is important for pronunciation.

## Stress

In Azerbaijani, stress is generally on the last syllable of a word. However, there are some exceptions:

1. Place names often have stress on the first syllable:
   **Bakı** ['bakɯ] (Baku)

2. Some loanwords retain their original stress:
   **radio** ['radio] (radio)

3. Some suffixes do not take stress:
   **kitablar** [ki'tablar] (books)

4. Compound words may have stress on both elements:
   **ana dili** ['ana 'dili] (mother tongue)

## Word Formation

Azerbaijani has several methods for forming new words:

### Compounding

Two or more words can be combined to form a new word:

- **ana** (mother) + **dil** (language) → **ana dili** (mother tongue)
- **dəmir** (iron) + **yol** (road) → **dəmiryol** (railway)

### Affixation

New words can be formed by adding prefixes or suffixes to existing words:

- **iş** (work) + **-çi** (agent suffix) → **işçi** (worker)
- **göz** (eye) + **-lük** (abstract noun suffix) → **gözlük** (eyeglasses)

### Reduplication

Some adjectives can be intensified by partial reduplication:

- **qara** (black) → **qapqara** (pitch black)
