# Proto-Norse

Proto-Norse, also known as Proto-Scandinavian or Proto-North Germanic, was the ancestor of all North Germanic languages. It was spoken roughly from 200 CE to 800 CE in Scandinavia and nearby areas. Proto-Norse developed from Proto-Germanic and eventually evolved into Old Norse, which then split into the various modern North Germanic languages like Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic, and Faroese.

## Writing System

Proto-Norse was primarily written using the Elder Futhark runic alphabet. This system consisted of 24 runes, each representing a sound in the language. The runes were typically carved into stone, wood, or metal.

Elder Futhark Runic Alphabet:

| Rune | Transliteration | Name | Meaning |
|------|-----------------|------|---------|
| ᚠ | f | fehu | "wealth, cattle" |
| ᚢ | u | ūruz | "aurochs" |
| ᚦ | þ | þurisaz | "giant" |
| ᚨ | a | ansuz | "god" |
| ᚱ | r | raidō | "ride, journey" |
| ᚲ | k | kaunan | "ulcer?" |
| ᚷ | g | gebō | "gift" |
| ᚹ | w | wunjō | "joy" |
| ᚺ | h | hagalaz | "hail (precipitation)" |
| ᚾ | n | naudiz | "need" |
| ᛁ | i | īsaz | "ice" |
| ᛃ | j | jēra | "year, good year, harvest" |
| ᛇ | ï | ī(h)waz/ēhwaz | "yew-tree" |
| ᛈ | p | perþō | Unknown |
| ᛉ | z | algiz | "elk" |
| ᛊ | s | sōwilō | "sun" |
| ᛏ | t | tīwaz | "Tyr (god)" |
| ᛒ | b | berkanan | "birch" |
| ᛖ | e | ehwaz | "horse" |
| ᛗ | m | mannaz | "man" |
| ᛚ | l | laguz | "water, lake" |
| ᛜ | ŋ | ingwaz | "Ing (god)" |
| ᛟ | o | ōþila/ōþala | "heritage, estate, possession" |
| ᛞ | d | dagaz | "day" |

The order of the runes gives the alphabet its name: the first six runes spell out "fuþark" (ᚠᚢᚦᚨᚱᚲ).

### Runic Inscriptions

Many Proto-Norse inscriptions have been found on various objects and stones. Here are some notable examples:

1. The Vimose comb (c. 160 CE):
   **ᚺᚨᚱᛃᚨ**
   Transliteration: harja
   Meaning: "comb" or a personal name

2. The Thorsberg chape (c. 200 CE):
   **ᛟᚹᛚᚦᚢᚦᛖᚹᚨᛉ᛬ᚾᛁᚹᚨᛃᛗᚨᚱᛁᛉ**
   Transliteration: owlþuþewaz niwajmariz
   Meaning: "servant of Ullr, descendant of Niwaj"

3. The Vimose buckle (c. 200 CE):
   **ᚺᚨᚱᛁᛊᚨ**
   Transliteration: harisa
   Meaning: Possibly a personal name

4. The Møjebro stone (c. 400 CE):
   **ᚨᚾᛁᛚᚨ᛬ᚨᛊᚨᚢᚷᛊᛞᚨᚢᚺᛏᚱ**
   Transliteration: anila asaugsdauhtʀ
   Meaning: "Anila, Asaug's daughter"

5. The Einang stone (c. 350-400 CE):
   **ᛞᚨᚷᚨᛊᛏᛁᛉ᛬ᚱᚢᚾᛟ᛬ᚠᚨᚺᛁᛞᛟ**
   Transliteration: dagastiz runo fahido
   Meaning: "I, Dagastiz, painted the rune"

These inscriptions provide valuable insights into the early stages of the Proto-Norse language and its writing system.

## Phonology

Proto-Norse had a rich phonological system that evolved from Proto-Germanic. Here's an overview of the consonant and vowel inventories:

### Consonants

| Manner\Place | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Labiovelar |
|--------------|--------|--------|----------|---------|-------|------------|
| Stops        | p b    | t d    |          |         | k g   |            |
| Fricatives   | f      | þ      | s z      |         | h     |            |
| Nasals       | m      |        | n        |         | ŋ     |            |
| Liquids      |        |        | r l      |         |       |            |
| Semivowels   |        |        |          | j       |       | w          |

### Vowels

| Height\Backness | Front | Central | Back |
|-----------------|-------|---------|------|
| High            | i iː  |         | u uː |
| Mid             | e eː  |         | o oː |
| Low             | æ æː  | a aː    |      |

Diphthongs: ai, au, eu, iu

### Sound Changes from Proto-Germanic to Proto-Norse

Several significant sound changes occurred in the transition from Proto-Germanic to Proto-Norse:

1. Vowel nasalization: Vowels before nasal consonants became nasalized.
   Example: Proto-Germanic *\*ansuz > Proto-Norse *\*ąsuz ("god")
   In runes: ᚨᚾᛊᚢᛉ > ᚨ̃ᛊᚢᛉ

2. Syncope: Unstressed vowels in medial syllables were often lost.
   Example: Proto-Germanic *\*gastiz > Proto-Norse *\*gastz ("guest")
   In runes: ᚷᚨᛊᛏᛁᛉ > ᚷᚨᛊᛏᛉ

3. Umlaut: Vowels were influenced by following vowels or semivowels.
   Example: Proto-Germanic *\*fōtuz > Proto-Norse *\*fōtʀ > Old Norse **fœtr** ("feet")
   In runes: ᚠᛟᛏᚢᛉ > ᚠᛟᛏᛉ > ᚠᚢᛏᚱ

4. Breaking: Short e and i were diphthongized before certain consonant clusters.
   Example: Proto-Germanic *\*erþō > Proto-Norse *\*iarþu ("earth")
   In runes: ᛖᚱᚦᛟ > ᛁᚨᚱᚦᚢ

5. R-mutation: A in the stressed syllable became e before r.
   Example: Proto-Germanic *\*armaz > Proto-Norse *\*armʀ > Old Norse **armr** ("arm")
   In runes: ᚨᚱᛗᚨᛉ > ᚨᚱᛗᛉ > ᛖᚱᛗᚱ

6. Assimilation of mp, nt, nk to pp, tt, kk:
   Example: Proto-Germanic *\*drinkan > Proto-Norse *\*drikkan ("to drink")
   In runes: ᛞᚱᛁᚾᚲᚨᚾ > ᛞᚱᛁᚲᚲᚨᚾ

7. Loss of final -z (which became -R in Old Norse):
   Example: Proto-Germanic *\*dagaz > Proto-Norse *\*dagaʀ ("day")
   In runes: ᛞᚨᚷᚨᛉ > ᛞᚨᚷᚨᛉ

These sound changes played a crucial role in shaping the distinctive features of Proto-Norse and its descendants.

## Morphology

Proto-Norse inherited a complex morphological system from Proto-Germanic, including declensions for nouns, adjectives, and pronouns, as well as conjugations for verbs.

### Nouns

Proto-Norse nouns were inflected for case (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative), number (singular, plural), and gender (masculine, feminine, neuter). The declension system was more complex than in later Norse languages.

Example declension of *\*dagaz ("day", masculine a-stem):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | *\*dagaz (ᛞᚨᚷᚨᛉ) | *\*dagōz (ᛞᚨᚷᛟᛉ) |
| Accusative | *\*dagan (ᛞᚨᚷᚨᚾ) | *\*daganz (ᛞᚨᚷᚨᚾᛉ) |
| Genitive | *\*dagas (ᛞᚨᚷᚨᛊ) | *\*dagō (ᛞᚨᚷᛟ) |
| Dative | *\*dagai (ᛞᚨᚷᚨᛁ) | *\*dagamaz (ᛞᚨᚷᚨᛗᚨᛉ) |

Example declension of *\*gebō ("gift", feminine ō-stem):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | *\*gebō (ᚷᛖᛒᛟ) | *\*gebōz (ᚷᛖᛒᛟᛉ) |
| Accusative | *\*gebōn (ᚷᛖᛒᛟᚾ) | *\*gebōz (ᚷᛖᛒᛟᛉ) |
| Genitive | *\*gebōz (ᚷᛖᛒᛟᛉ) | *\*gebō (ᚷᛖᛒᛟ) |
| Dative | *\*gebōi (ᚷᛖᛒᛟᛁ) | *\*gebōmaz (ᚷᛖᛒᛟᛗᚨᛉ) |

Example declension of *\*barnan ("child", neuter a-stem):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | *\*barnan (ᛒᚨᚱᚾᚨᚾ) | *\*barnō (ᛒᚨᚱᚾᛟ) |
| Accusative | *\*barnan (ᛒᚨᚱᚾᚨᚾ) | *\*barnō (ᛒᚨᚱᚾᛟ) |
| Genitive | *\*barnas (ᛒᚨᚱᚾᚨᛊ) | *\*barnō (ᛒᚨᚱᚾᛟ) |
| Dative | *\*barnai (ᛒᚨᚱᚾᚨᛁ) | *\*barnamaz (ᛒᚨᚱᚾᚨᛗᚨᛉ) |

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Proto-Norse agreed with the nouns they modified in case, number, and gender. They had both strong and weak declensions.

Example of strong declension for *\*gōdaz ("good"):

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nom. Sg. | *\*gōdaz (ᚷᛟᛞᚨᛉ) | *\*gōdō (ᚷᛟᛞᛟ) | *\*gōdan (ᚷᛟᛞᚨᚾ) |
| Acc. Sg. | *\*gōdan (ᚷᛟᛞᚨᚾ) | *\*gōdō (ᚷᛟᛞᛟ) | *\*gōdan (ᚷᛟᛞᚨᚾ) |
| Gen. Sg. | *\*gōdas (ᚷᛟᛞᚨᛊ) | *\*gōdōz (ᚷᛟᛞᛟᛉ) | *\*gōdas (ᚷᛟᛞᚨᛊ) |
| Dat. Sg. | *\*gōdai (ᚷᛟᛞᚨᛁ) | *\*gōdōi (ᚷᛟᛞᛟᛁ) | *\*gōdai (ᚷᛟᛞᚨᛁ) |

Example of weak declension for *\*gōdōn ("the good"):

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nom. Sg. | *\*gōdō (ᚷᛟᛞᛟ) | *\*gōdōn (ᚷᛟᛞᛟᚾ) | *\*gōdōn (ᚷᛟᛞᛟᚾ) |
| Acc. Sg. | *\*gōdōn (ᚷᛟᛞᛟᚾ) | *\*gōdōn (ᚷᛟᛞᛟᚾ) | *\*gōdōn (ᚷᛟᛞᛟᚾ) |
| Gen. Sg. | *\*gōdōns (ᚷᛟᛞᛟᚾᛊ) | *\*gōdōnz (ᚷᛟᛞᛟᚾᛉ) | *\*gōdōns (ᚷᛟᛞᛟᚾᛊ) |
| Dat. Sg. | *\*gōdōn (ᚷᛟᛞᛟᚾ) | *\*gōdōn (ᚷᛟᛞᛟᚾ) | *\*gōdōn (ᚷᛟᛞōn) |

### Pronouns

Proto-Norse had personal, demonstrative, interrogative, and relative pronouns. Here's an example of personal pronouns:

| Person | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive | Dative |
|--------|------------|------------|----------|--------|

- *\*hwar (ᚺᚹᚨᚱ) "where"
- *\*hwanō (ᚺᚹᚨᚾᛟ) "when"
- *\*hwī (ᚺᚹᛁ) "why"

### Verbs

Proto-Norse verbs were conjugated for person, number, tense, mood, and voice. The system included strong verbs (with ablaut) and weak verbs.

Strong verb example: *\*drīban ("to drive")

| Person | Present | Past |
|--------|---------|------|
| 1sg | *\*drībō (ᛞᚱᛁᛒᛟ) | *\*draib (ᛞᚱᚨᛁᛒ) |
| 2sg | *\*drībiz (ᛞᚱᛁᛒᛁᛉ) | *\*draift (ᛞᚱᚨᛁᚠᛏ) |

Verb moods:

1. Indicative (as shown above)
2. Subjunctive
   Example: *\*drībai (ᛞᚱᛁᛒᚨᛁ) "may he drive"
3. Imperative
   Example: *\*drīb (ᛞᚱᛁᛒ) "drive!"

Verb voices:

1. Active (as shown above)
2. Mediopassive (formed with the suffix *\*-ai)
   Example: *\*drībai (ᛞᚱᛁᛒᚨᛁ) "is driven"

## Syntax

Proto-Norse likely had a relatively free word order due to its complex case system, but the basic word order was probably Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), as in Proto-Germanic.

Example:
**\*Ek hanan sehwō** (ᛖᚲ ᚺᚨᚾᚨᚾ ᛊᛖᚺᚹᛟ) ("I see the rooster")
Literally: "I rooster-ACC see"

However, other word orders were possible for emphasis or stylistic reasons:

**\*Hanan ek sehwō** (ᚺᚨᚾᚨᚾ ᛖᚲ ᛊᛖᚺᚹᛟ) ("The rooster, I see")
**\*Sehwō ek hanan** (ᛊᛖᚺᚹᛟ ᛖᚲ ᚺᚨᚾᚨᚾ) ("See I the rooster")

### Negation

Negation in Proto-Norse was likely expressed using the particle *\*ne before the verb:

**\*Ek ne sehwō** (ᛖᚲ ᚾᛖ ᛊᛖᚺᚹᛟ) ("I do not see")

### Questions

Questions were probably formed by changing the intonation or by using interrogative pronouns:

**\*Hwaz hit dedē?** (ᚺᚹᚨᛉ ᚺᛁᛏ ᛞᛖᛞᛖ) ("Who did it?")
**\*Hwar þū būiz?** (ᚺᚹᚨᚱ ᚦᚢ ᛒᚢᛁᛉ) ("Where do you live?")

### Subordinate Clauses

Subordinate clauses were likely introduced by conjunctions or relative pronouns:

**\*Ek wait þat þū kamt** (ᛖᚲ ᚹᚨᛁᛏ ᚦᚨᛏ ᚦᚢ ᚲᚨᛗᛏ) ("I know that you came")

### Noun Phrases

Noun phrases typically consisted of a noun and its modifiers, with adjectives usually preceding the noun:

**\*Mikil skip** (ᛗᛁᚲᛁᛚ ᛊᚲᛁᛈ) ("big ship")
**\*Þat gōdō swerd** (ᚦᚨᛏ ᚷᛟᛞᛟ ᛊᚹᛖᚱᛞ) ("the good sword")

### Possession

Possession was likely expressed using the genitive case:

**\*Mannaz hūs** (ᛗᚨᚾᚾᚨᛉ ᚺᚢᛊ) ("man's house")

## Vocabulary

Proto-Norse vocabulary was largely inherited from Proto-Germanic, with some innovations and loanwords. Here are some examples of Proto-Norse words:

## Reconstructed Sentences

Here are some examples of reconstructed Proto-Norse sentences, along with their runic inscriptions and English translations:

1. **\*Ek haitō Hlewagastiz** (ᛖᚲ ᚺᚨᛁᛏᛟ ᚺᛚᛖᚹᚨᚷᚨᛊᛏᛁᛉ)
   "I am called Hlewagastiz"

## Phonological and Morphological Changes

As Proto-Norse evolved into Old Norse and eventually into the modern North Germanic languages, it underwent several significant changes:

1. Umlaut: This sound change affected vowels when followed by certain sounds in the next syllable. For example:
   *\*fōtuz > *\*fœtʀ > Old Norse **fœtr** ("feet")

2. Breaking: This involved the diphthongization of front vowels before certain consonants:
   *\*hertō > *\*hiartā > Old Norse **hjarta** ("heart")

3. Syncope: The loss of unstressed vowels in medial syllables:
   *\*gastiz > *\*gastr > Old Norse **gestr** ("guest")

4. Loss of final -z: The final -z sound (which became -R in Old Norse) was eventually lost:
   *\*dagaz > *\*dagaR > Old Norse **dagr** ("day")

5. Vowel nasalization and subsequent denasalization:
   *\*ansuz > *\*ąsuR > Old Norse **áss** ("god")

6. Assimilation of mp, nt, nk to pp, tt, kk:
   *\*drinkan > *\*drikka > Old Norse **drekka** ("to drink")

These changes, along with others, contributed to the distinct features of Old Norse and its descendants, shaping the phonology and morphology of the modern North Germanic languages.

## Cultural Context

Proto-Norse was spoken during a time of great change in Scandinavian society. This period saw the development of runic writing, the beginnings of Norse mythology, and the early stages of Viking culture. The language would have been used for everyday communication, religious rituals, and the composition of early Germanic poetry.

The runic inscriptions left behind provide valuable insights into the culture and beliefs of the Proto-Norse speakers. Many inscriptions are names or short phrases, but some longer texts exist, often with magical or commemorative purposes.

As Proto-Norse developed into Old Norse, it became the language of the Viking Age, used in the composition of skaldic poetry and the Eddas, which preserve much of Norse mythology and heroic legends.

The study of Proto-Norse is crucial for understanding the development of the North Germanic languages and the cultural history of Scandinavia. It provides a window into the linguistic and cultural foundations that would later give rise to the Viking Age and shape the modern Nordic countries.
