# Mainland Southeast Asia Linguistic Area

The Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) Linguistic Area, also known as the Indochina Linguistic Area, is a sprachbund (language convergence area) encompassing languages from several different families spoken in the continental part of Southeast Asia. This area primarily includes Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar (Burma), and parts of southern China.

## Language Families

The MSEA Linguistic Area includes languages from several distinct families:

1. Austroasiatic (e.g., Vietnamese, Khmer)
2. Tai-Kadai (e.g., Thai, Lao)
3. Sino-Tibetan (e.g., Burmese, various Chinese varieties)
4. Hmong-Mien (e.g., Hmong, Mien)
5. Austronesian (e.g., Cham, although primarily found in insular Southeast Asia)

Despite their genetic diversity, these languages have developed many shared features through prolonged contact and mutual influence.

## Shared Linguistic Features

The shared features, despite the genetic diversity of the languages, highlight the extensive language contact and mutual influence that has occurred in this area over centuries.
