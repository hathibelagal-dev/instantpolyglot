# Pali

Pali is an ancient Indo-Aryan language that served as the primary liturgical and scholarly language of Theravada Buddhism. It is closely related to Sanskrit and is considered a Middle Indo-Aryan language. Pali was the language in which the Theravada Buddhist canon, known as the Tipitaka or Pali Canon, was written and preserved. While Pali is no longer spoken as a native language, it continues to be studied and used in Buddhist scholarship and religious practices.

## Historical Context

Pali developed from the vernacular languages of northern India during the time of the Buddha (c. 5th century BCE). It is believed to have originated from a dialect spoken in the region of Magadha (modern-day Bihar). The name "Pali" itself means "text" or "line," and it originally referred to the canonical texts rather than the language itself.

As Buddhism spread across South and Southeast Asia, Pali traveled with it, becoming the lingua franca of Theravada Buddhist teachings. It was adopted in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, where it continues to play a significant role in Buddhist studies and rituals.

## Writing System

Pali does not have its own native script. Historically, it has been written in various scripts depending on the region where it was used. Some of the scripts commonly used for writing Pali include:

1. Brahmi script (ancient India)
2. Devanagari script (India and Nepal)
3. Sinhala script (Sri Lanka)
4. Burmese script (Myanmar)
5. Thai script (Thailand)
6. Khmer script (Cambodia)
7. Lao script (Laos)

For academic purposes and transliteration, the Roman alphabet with diacritical marks is commonly used. This system, known as the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) or a slight variation of it, allows for consistent representation of Pali sounds across different languages and writing systems.

In this document, we will use the romanized version of Pali with appropriate diacritical marks.

## Phonology

### Vowels

Pali has eight vowels, consisting of three pairs of short and long vowels, plus two additional vowels that are always long:

| Short | Long |
|-------|------|
| a [ə] | ā [aː] |
| i [i] | ī [iː] |
| u [u] | ū [uː] |
| e [e] | o [o] |

The vowels e and o are always long in Pali, so they are not marked with a macron.

Examples:
- **patta** [pəttə] "bowl"
- **mātā** [maːtaː] "mother"
- **iti** [iti] "thus"
- **sīla** [siːlə] "virtue"
- **buddha** [buddʰə] "awakened one"
- **pūjā** [puːdʒaː] "worship"
- **mettā** [mettaː] "loving-kindness"
- **loka** [loːkə] "world"

### Consonants

Pali has 33 consonants, organized into several groups based on their place and manner of articulation:

| Type | Unvoiced | Voiced | Nasal |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Velar | k, kh | g, gh | ṅ |
| Palatal | c, ch | j, jh | ñ |
| Retroflex | ṭ, ṭh | ḍ, ḍh | ṇ |
| Dental | t, th | d, dh | n |
| Labial | p, ph | b, bh | m |

Additionally, there are:
- Semivowels: y, r, l, v
- Sibilant: s
- Aspirate: h
- Anusvāra: ṃ
- Visarga: ḥ (rare in Pali)

### Pronunciation Rules

1. Aspirated consonants (kh, gh, ch, jh, ṭh, ḍh, th, dh, ph, bh) are pronounced with a puff of air following the consonant sound.

2. Retroflex consonants (ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh, ṇ) are pronounced with the tongue curled back to touch the roof of the mouth.

3. The ṃ (anusvāra) is pronounced as a nasal sound, often assimilating to the place of articulation of the following consonant.

4. The visarga (ḥ) is rare in Pali and is usually pronounced as a voiceless glottal fricative [h] when it does occur.

5. The semivowel v is often pronounced as [w] when it follows a consonant and precedes a vowel.

Examples:
- **kamma** [kəmmə] "action"
- **khanti** [kʰənti] "patience"
- **gāma** [gaːmə] "village"
- **ghara** [gʰərə] "house"
- **cakka** [tʃəkkə] "wheel"
- **chanda** [tʃʰəndə] "desire"
- **jāti** [dʒaːti] "birth"
- **jhāna** [dʒʰaːnə] "meditation"
- **ṭhāna** [ʈʰaːnə] "place"
- **paṇḍita** [pəɳɖitə] "wise person"
- **taṇhā** [təɳhaː] "craving"
- **dhamma** [dʰəmmə] "teaching, truth"
- **nāma** [naːmə] "name"
- **paññā** [pənɲaː] "wisdom"
- **phala** [pʰələ] "fruit"
- **bhāvanā** [bʰaːwənaː] "mental development"
- **magga** [məggə] "path"
- **yoga** [joːgə] "connection"
- **loka** [loːkə] "world"
- **vācā** [waːtʃaː] "speech"
- **saṃsāra** [səmsaːrə] "cycle of rebirth"

### Syllable Structure

Pali syllables typically follow the structure (C)V(C), where C represents a consonant and V represents a vowel. The possible syllable structures are:

1. V: **a-haṃ** "I"
2. CV: **bu-ddha** "awakened one"
3. VC: **aṭ-ṭha** "eight"
4. CVC: **kam-ma** "action"

Long vowels and diphthongs count as a single vowel unit in this structure.

### Sandhi

Sandhi refers to the phonological changes that occur at word boundaries or between morphemes. Pali has a complex system of sandhi rules, which can be broadly categorized into three types:

1. Vowel sandhi: Changes involving vowels at word boundaries
2. Consonant sandhi: Changes involving consonants at word boundaries
3. Niggahita sandhi: Changes involving the anusvāra (ṃ)

Some common sandhi rules include:

1. When a word ending in a vowel is followed by a word beginning with a different vowel, the first vowel is often elided:
   **na + atthi** → **natthi** "there is not"

2. When a word ending in ṃ is followed by a vowel, the ṃ often changes to m:
   **taṃ + ahaṃ** → **tam ahaṃ** "that I"

3. When a word ending in a voiced consonant is followed by a word beginning with an unvoiced consonant, the first consonant often becomes unvoiced:
   **tad + phala** → **tappala** "the fruit of that"

Understanding sandhi rules is crucial for proper pronunciation and comprehension of Pali texts.

## Morphology

Pali is a highly inflected language with a rich system of declensions and conjugations. Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives are inflected for case, number, and gender, while verbs are conjugated for tense, mood, voice, person, and number.

### Nouns

Nouns in Pali are inflected for three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural), and eight cases.

#### Cases

1. Nominative (subject)
2. Accusative (direct object)
3. Instrumental (by means of)
4. Dative (to, for)
5. Ablative (from)
6. Genitive (of, possessive)
7. Locative (in, at, on)
8. Vocative (address)

#### Example Declension: "Buddha" (masculine)

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **buddho** | **buddhā** |
| Accusative | **buddhaṃ** | **buddhe** |
| Instrumental | **buddhena** | **buddhehi** |
| Dative | **buddhassa** | **buddhānaṃ** |
| Ablative | **buddhā** | **buddhehi** |
| Genitive | **buddhassa** | **buddhānaṃ** |
| Locative | **buddhe** | **buddhesu** |
| Vocative | **buddha** | **buddhā** |

Example usage:
- **Buddho dhammaṃ deseti.** "The Buddha teaches the Dhamma." (Nominative)

- **Buddhe pasādo atthi.** "There is faith in the Buddha." (Locative)
- **Ehi, buddha!** "Come, O Buddha!" (Vocative)

#### Stem Classes

Pali nouns are divided into several stem classes based on their ending. The main stem classes are:

1. a-stems (e.g., **buddha**)
2. ā-stems (e.g., **kaññā** "girl")
3. i-stems (e.g., **aggi** "fire")
4. ī-stems (e.g., **nadī** "river")
5. u-stems (e.g., **bhikkhu** "monk")
6. ū-stems (e.g., **vadhū** "bride")
7. Consonant stems (e.g., **rājan** "king")

Each stem class has its own declension pattern, although there are similarities across classes.

### Pronouns

Pali has personal, demonstrative, relative, and interrogative pronouns. They are declined similarly to nouns but with some irregularities.

#### Personal Pronouns

1st person:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **ahaṃ** | **mayaṃ** |
| Accusative | **maṃ, mamaṃ** | **amhe** |

| Dative/Genitive | **mama, mayhaṃ** | **amhākaṃ** |
| Ablative | **mayā** | **amhehi** |
| Locative | **mayi** | **amhesu** |

2nd person:

| Case | Singular | Plural |

#### Demonstrative Pronouns

Pali has several demonstrative pronouns, including:

1. **ayaṃ** (this, near)
2. **eso** (that, not too far)
3. **asu** (that, far)

These pronouns are declined for gender, number, and case.

Example usage:
- **Ayaṃ puriso** "This man"
- **Esā itthī** "That woman"
- **Aduṃ phalaṃ** "That fruit (over there)"

#### Relative Pronouns

The relative pronoun in Pali is **ya-**. It is declined for gender, number, and case.

Example usage:
- **Yo dhammaṃ passati, so buddhaṃ passati.** "He who sees the Dhamma sees the Buddha."

#### Interrogative Pronouns

Common interrogative pronouns include:

1. **ko** (who, masculine)
2. **kā** (who, feminine)
3. **kiṃ** (what, neuter)

Example usage:
- **Ko esi?** "Who are you?"
- **Kiṃ karosi?** "What are you doing?"

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Pali agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case. They generally follow the same declension patterns as nouns.

Example: **sundara** "beautiful"

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nom. Sing. | **sundaro** | **sundarā** | **sundaraṃ** |
| Acc. Sing. | **sundaraṃ** | **sundaraṃ** | **sundaraṃ** |
| Instr. Sing. | **sundarena** | **sundarāya** | **sundarena** |

Example usage:
- **Sundaro buddho** "Beautiful Buddha"
- **Sundarā dhammā** "Beautiful teachings"
- **Sundaraṃ cittaṃ** "Beautiful mind"

#### Comparison of Adjectives

Pali forms comparative and superlative degrees of adjectives using suffixes:

1. Comparative: **-tara**
2. Superlative: **-tama**

Example:
- Positive: **sundara** "beautiful"
- Comparative: **sundaratara** "more beautiful"
- Superlative: **sundaratama** "most beautiful"

Another way to form comparatives and superlatives is by using the words **seyya** (better) and **seṭṭha** (best):

- **Sīlaṃ seyyo dhanaṃ.** "Virtue is better than wealth."
- **Buddho seṭṭho manussānaṃ.** "The Buddha is the best among humans."

### Verbs

Pali verbs are conjugated for tense, mood, voice, person, and number. The verbal system is complex, with various tenses and moods.

#### Present Tense

The present tense in Pali is used to describe actions happening in the present or habitual actions. It is formed by adding personal endings to the verb stem.

Example: **gacchati** "goes"

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 3rd | **gacchati** | **gacchanti** |
| 2nd | **gacchasi** | **gacchatha** |
| 1st | **gacchāmi** | **gacchāma** |

Example usage:
- **Ahaṃ gacchāmi.** "I go."
- **Tvaṃ gacchasi.** "You go."
- **So gacchati.** "He goes."
- **Mayaṃ gacchāma.** "We go."

#### Past Tense (Aorist)

The aorist is commonly used for past actions. It has various forms, but here's a common pattern:

Example: **agamāsi** "went"

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 3rd | **agamāsi** | **agamaṃsu** |
| 2nd | **agamāsi** | **agamattha** |
| 1st | **agamaṃ** | **agamamha** |

Example usage:
- **So agamāsi.** "He went."
- **Te agamaṃsu.** "They went."
- **Ahaṃ agamaṃ.** "I went."

#### Future Tense

The future tense in Pali is used to describe actions that will happen in the future. It is formed by adding the suffix **-issa-** or **-essa-** to the verb stem, followed by personal endings.

Example: **gamissati** "will go"

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 3rd | **gamissati** | **gamissanti** |
| 2nd | **gamissasi** | **gamissatha** |
| 1st | **gamissāmi** | **gamissāma** |

Example usage:
- **Ahaṃ gamissāmi.** "I will go."
- **Tvaṃ gamissasi.** "You will go."
- **Te gamissanti.** "They will go."

#### Imperative Mood

The imperative mood is used for commands, requests, or exhortations. It is formed by adding specific endings to the verb stem.

Example: **gaccha** "go!"

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 3rd | **gacchatu** | **gacchantu** |
| 2nd | **gaccha** | **gacchatha** |
| 1st | **gacchāmi** | **gacchāma** |

Example usage:
- **Gaccha, bhikkhu!** "Go, monk!"
- **Gacchatha, bhikkhave!** "Go, monks!"
- **Gacchāma, āvuso.** "Let's go, friend."

#### Optative Mood

The optative mood is used to express wishes, possibilities, or polite commands. It is formed by adding the suffix **-eyya-** to the verb stem, followed by personal endings.

Example: **bhaveyya** "may be, would be"

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 3rd | **bhaveyya** | **bhaveyyuṃ** |
| 2nd | **bhaveyyāsi** | **bhaveyyātha** |
| 1st | **bhaveyyāmi** | **bhaveyyāma** |

Example usage:
- **Sukhi bhaveyya.** "May he be happy."
- **Evaṃ bhaveyyāma.** "Thus we would be."

#### Conditional Mood

The conditional mood is used to express hypothetical situations or actions that would have happened under certain conditions. It is formed by adding the suffix **-issa-** to the verb stem, followed by past tense endings.

Example: **abhavissa** "would have been"

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 3rd | **abhavissa** | **abhavissamsu** |
| 2nd | **abhavisse** | **abhavissatha** |
| 1st | **abhavissaṃ** | **abhavissāma** |

Example usage:
- **Sace so āgacchissa, ahaṃ abhavissaṃ.** "If he had come, I would have been (there)."

#### Passive Voice

Passive verbs are formed by adding **-ya-** or **-īya-** to the verb root and using middle voice endings.

Example: **dīyati** "is given" (from **dadāti** "gives")

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 3rd | **dīyati** | **dīyanti** |
| 2nd | **dīyasi** | **dīyatha** |
| 1st | **dīyāmi** | **dīyāma** |

Example usage:
- **Dānaṃ dīyati.** "A gift is given."
- **Dhammā desīyanti.** "The teachings are taught."

#### Causative Verbs

Causative verbs express the idea of causing someone to do something. They are formed by adding the suffix **-āpe-** or **-āpaya-** to the verb root.

Example: **kārāpeti** "causes to do" (from **karoti** "does")

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 3rd | **kārāpeti** | **kārāpenti** |
| 2nd | **kārāpesi** | **kārāpetha** |
| 1st | **kārāpemi** | **kārāpema** |

Example usage:
- **Rājā gehaṃ kārāpeti.** "The king causes a house to be built."

### Participles

Pali has several types of participles, which function as verbal adjectives. The main types are:

1. Present Active Participle: formed by adding **-anta** or **-māna** to the present stem
   Example: **gacchanta** "going"

2. Past Passive Participle: usually formed by adding **-ta** or **-ita** to the verb root
   Example: **kata** "done" (from **karoti** "does")

3. Future Passive Participle: formed by adding **-tabba** or **-anīya** to the verb root
   Example: **kātabba** "should be done"

4. Past Active Participle: formed by adding **-tvā** or **-tūna** to the verb root
   Example: **gantvā** "having gone"

Example usage:
- **Gacchanto bhikkhu** "The going monk"
- **Kataṃ kammaṃ** "The done action"
- **Kātabbaṃ kammaṃ** "The action that should be done"
- **Gantvā so avoca** "Having gone, he said"

### Infinitives

Infinitives in Pali are formed by adding **-tuṃ** to the verb root.

Example:
- **gacchati** (goes) → **gantuṃ** (to go)
- **karoti** (does) → **kātuṃ** (to do)

Example usage:
- **So gantuṃ icchati.** "He wants to go."

## Syntax

### Word Order

Pali generally follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, but it is relatively flexible due to its case system. Other orders are possible for emphasis or stylistic reasons.

Examples:
- **Buddho dhammaṃ deseti.** (SOV) "The Buddha teaches the Dhamma."
- **Dhammaṃ buddho deseti.** (OSV) "The Dhamma, the Buddha teaches."
- **Deseti buddho dhammaṃ.** (VSO) "Teaches the Buddha the Dhamma."

### Sentence Structure

1. Simple sentences:
   **Ahaṃ gacchāmi.** "I go."

2. Compound sentences:
   **So āgacchati ca gacchati ca.** "He comes and goes."

3. Complex sentences:
   **Yadā so āgacchati, tadā ahaṃ gacchāmi.** "When he comes, then I go."

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed using **na** before the verb:

- **Ahaṃ na gacchāmi.** "I do not go."
- **So na passati.** "He does not see."

Double negation is sometimes used for emphasis:
- **Na hi natthi pañño āloko.** "There is indeed no light of wisdom." (Literally: "Not indeed not-exists wisdom's light.")

### Questions

Questions can be formed in several ways:

1. By adding the particle **nu** at the end of a statement:
   **Tvaṃ gacchasi nu?** "Do you go?"

2. By using question words:
   **Ko so?** "Who is he?"
   **Kiṃ karosi?** "What are you doing?"
   **Kasmā āgacchasi?** "Why do you come?"

3. By intonation (in spoken Pali):
   **Tvaṃ gacchasi?** "You go?" / "Do you go?"

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are formed using the relative pronoun **ya-**:

- **Yo dhammaṃ passati, so buddhaṃ passati.** "He who sees the Dhamma sees the Buddha."
- **Yaṃ kiñci samudayadhammaṃ, sabbaṃ taṃ nirodhadhammaṃ.** "Whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation."

### Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences in Pali often use the particle **sace** ("if") in the protasis (if-clause) and may use the optative or conditional mood in the apodosis (then-clause):

- **Sace tvaṃ gacchasi, ahaṃ pi gacchāmi.** "If you go, I too will go."
- **Sace so āgaccheyya, sukhaṃ bhaveyya.** "If he were to come, it would be pleasant."

### Absolutive Constructions

Pali makes extensive use of absolutive constructions, which are formed with the past active participle (usually ending in **-tvā**). These constructions express an action that precedes or is simultaneous with the main verb:

- **Bhikkhu gāmaṃ gantvā piṇḍāya cari.** "Having gone to the village, the monk wandered for alms."
- **Buddho nisīditvā dhammaṃ desesi.** "Having sat down, the Buddha taught the Dhamma."

### Passive Constructions

Passive constructions in Pali often use the instrumental case to express the agent:

- **Buddhena dhammo desīyati.** "The Dhamma is taught by the Buddha."
- **Mayā kammam kataṃ.** "The work is done by me."
