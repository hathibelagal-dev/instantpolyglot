# Sanskrit

Sanskrit (संस्कृतम्, saṃskṛtam) is an ancient Indo-Aryan language that has played a significant role in the cultural and religious history of the Indian subcontinent and beyond. It is one of the oldest documented members of the Indo-European language family and has a rich literary tradition spanning over three millennia.

## Phonology and Orthography

Sanskrit has a complex phonological system with a large inventory of sounds. It is traditionally written in various Indic scripts, with Devanagari being the most common in modern times.

### Vowels

Sanskrit distinguishes between short and long vowels:

| Short | Long | Sound |
|-------|------|-------|
| अ a   | आ ā   | [ə], [aː] |
| इ i   | ई ī   | [i], [iː] |
| उ u   | ऊ ū   | [u], [uː] |
| ऋ ṛ   | ॠ ṝ   | [r̩], [r̩ː] |
| ऌ ḷ   | ॡ ḹ   | [l̩], [l̩ː] |

Additionally, there are two diphthongs:

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| ए e    | [eː]  |
| ओ o    | [oː]  |

### Consonants

Sanskrit has a rich consonant inventory, organized systematically:

| Type      | Velar | Palatal | Retroflex | Dental | Labial |
|-----------|-------|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Stops     | क ka [k] | च ca [tɕ] | ट ṭa [ʈ] | त ta [t̪] | प pa [p] |
|           | ख kha [kʰ] | छ cha [tɕʰ] | ठ ṭha [ʈʰ] | थ tha [t̪ʰ] | फ pha [pʰ] |
|           | ग ga [g] | ज ja [dʑ] | ड ḍa [ɖ] | द da [d̪] | ब ba [b] |
|           | घ gha [gʱ] | झ jha [dʑʱ] | ढ ḍha [ɖʱ] | ध dha [d̪ʱ] | भ bha [bʱ] |
| Nasals    | ङ ṅa [ŋ] | ञ ña [ɲ] | ण ṇa [ɳ] | न na [n̪] | म ma [m] |
| Semivowels| य ya [j] |  | र ra [r] | ल la [l] | व va [ʋ] |
| Sibilants |  | श śa [ɕ] | ष ṣa [ʂ] | स sa [s] |  |
| Aspirate  |  |  |  |  | ह ha [ɦ] |

### Visarga and Anusvāra

- Visarga: ः (ḥ) - [h] or [ɦ]
- Anusvāra: ं (ṃ) - nasalization of the preceding vowel

### Sandhi

Sanskrit has complex rules of sandhi (sound changes at word boundaries). For example:

1. Vowel sandhi:
   **अत्र अस्ति** (atra asti) → **अत्रास्ति** (atrāsti) “here is”

2. Consonant sandhi:
   **तत् च** (tat ca) → **तच्च** (tacca) “and that”

3. Visarga sandhi:
   **रामः गच्छति** (rāmaḥ gacchati) → **रामो गच्छति** (rāmo gacchati) “Rama goes”

## Morphology

Sanskrit is a highly inflected language with a rich system of declensions and conjugations.

### Nouns

Nouns in Sanskrit are declined for:

- 3 genders: masculine, feminine, neuter
- 3 numbers: singular, dual, plural
- 8 cases: nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative

Example declension of **देव** (deva, “god”, masculine):

| Case | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| Nominative | देवः (devaḥ) | देवौ (devau) | देवाः (devāḥ) |

### Adjectives

Adjectives generally agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case. They follow similar declension patterns to nouns. For example:

**महत्** (mahat, “great”):

| Gender | Nominative Singular | Nominative Plural |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Masculine | महान् (mahān) | महान्तः (mahāntaḥ) |
| Feminine | महती (mahatī) | महत्यः (mahatyaḥ) |
| Neuter | महत् (mahat) | महान्ति (mahānti) |

### Verbs

Sanskrit verbs are highly complex, with conjugations for:

- 3 persons: first, second, third
- 3 numbers: singular, dual, plural
- 10 tenses and moods: present, imperfect, future, aorist, perfect, pluperfect, conditional, optative, imperative, benedictive
- 2 voices: active (parasmaipada) and middle (ātmanepada)

Verbs are organized into ten classes based on their stem formation.

Example conjugation of **भू** (bhū, “to be”) in the present tense, active voice:

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | भवामि (bhavāmi) | भवावः (bhavāvaḥ) | भवामः (bhavāmaḥ) |

| 3rd | भवति (bhavati) | भवतः (bhavataḥ) | भवन्ति (bhavanti) |

#### Participles

Sanskrit has a rich system of participles:

1. Present participle:
   - Active: **भवत्** (bhavat) “being”
   - Middle: **भवमान** (bhavamāna) “being”

2. Past participle:
   - **भूत** (bhūta) “been”

3. Future participle:
   - **भविष्यत्** (bhaviṣyat) “about to be”

4. Perfect participle:
   - **बभूव** (babhūva) “having been”

#### Gerunds

The gerund (indeclinable participle) is formed by adding **-त्वा** (-tvā) to the verbal root:
**कृत्वा** (kṛtvā) “having done”

### Compounds

Sanskrit is known for its extensive use of compound words. Some common types include:

1. Dvandva (copulative): **रामलक्ष्मणौ** (rāmalakṣmaṇau) “Rama and Lakshmana”
2. Tatpurusha (determinative): **राजपुत्रः** (rājaputraḥ) “king's son”
3. Karmadhāraya (descriptive): **नीलोत्पलम्** (nīlotpalam) “blue lotus”
4. Bahuvrīhi (possessive): **चक्रपाणिः** (cakrapāṇiḥ) “whose hand holds a discus” (epithet of Vishnu)

## Syntax

Sanskrit has a relatively free word order, with SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) being the most common. However, word order can change for emphasis or poetic reasons.

### Basic Sentence Structure

A basic Sanskrit sentence might look like this:

**रामः वनं गच्छति।** (rāmaḥ vanaṃ gacchati.)
“Rama goes to the forest.”

Here, “Rama” (रामः) is in the nominative case, “forest” (वनम्) is in the accusative case, and “goes” (गच्छति) is the verb.

### Agreement

Verbs agree with their subjects in person and number:

**अहं पठामि।** (ahaṃ paṭhāmi.) “I read.”
**त्वं पठसि।** (tvaṃ paṭhasi.) “You read.”
**सः पठति।** (saḥ paṭhati.) “He reads.”

Adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case:

**सुन्दरः बालकः** (sundaraḥ bālakaḥ) “beautiful boy” (masculine)
**सुन्दरी बालिका** (sundarī bālikā) “beautiful girl” (feminine)
**सुन्दरं पुस्तकम्** (sundaraṃ pustakam) “beautiful book” (neuter)

### Passive Voice

The passive voice is formed by using the middle voice endings with a special stem:

Active: **रामः पुस्तकं पठति।** (rāmaḥ pustakaṃ paṭhati.)
“Rama reads the book.”

Passive: **रामेण पुस्तकं पठ्यते।** (rāmeṇa pustakaṃ paṭhyate.)
“The book is read by Rama.”

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Sanskrit use the relative pronoun **यद्** (yad):

**यः पुरुषः तत्र तिष्ठति, सः मम मित्रम् अस्ति।** (yaḥ puruṣaḥ tatra tiṣṭhati, saḥ mama mitram asti.)
“The man who stands there is my friend.”

## Vocabulary

Sanskrit vocabulary has had a profound influence on many Indian languages, as well as some Southeast Asian languages. Many Sanskrit words have also entered English, often via other languages.

## Literary Traditions

Sanskrit has a vast literary tradition spanning various genres:

### Vedic Sanskrit

The oldest form of Sanskrit, used in the Vedas, the ancient religious texts of Hinduism:

**अग्निमीळे पुरोहितं यज्ञस्य देवमृत्विजम् ।**
**होतारं रत्नधातमम् ॥**
(agnimīḷe purohitaṃ yajñasya devamṛtvijam |
hotāraṃ ratnadhātamam ||)

“I praise Agni, the foremost, god-priest of the sacrifice, the divine, minister, invoker, most lavish of wealth.”
(Rigveda 1.1.1)

### Classical Sanskrit

Used in later literature, including epics, poetry, and philosophical texts:

**कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।**
**मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि॥**
(karmaṇyevādhikāraste mā phaleṣu kadācana |
mā karmaphalaheturbhūrmā te saṅgo'stvakarmaṇi ||)

“You have the right to work only, but never to its fruits. Let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction.”
(Bhagavad Gita 2.47)

### Kāvya

Ornate poetry and prose, often with complex meter and elaborate figures of speech:

**मेघ यदि गमिष्यसि त्वमिमां दिशम्**
**अलकापुरीं प्रति प्रियतमालयम् ।**
**वीक्ष्य विरहिणीं तदा मम वियोगिनीं**
**ब्रूहि सखे समागमसुखं मयि त्वरते ॥**
(megha yadi gamiṣyasi tvamimāṃ diśam
alakāpurīṃ prati priyatamālayam |
vīkṣya virahiṇīṃ tadā mama viyoginīṃ
brūhi sakhe samāgamasukhaṃ mayi tvarate ||)

“O cloud, if you are going in this direction,
Towards Alaka, the abode of my beloved,
Then, seeing my lonely, separated love,
Tell her, friend, that I long for the joy of our reunion.”
(Meghadūta by Kālidāsa)

## Grammatical Features

### Dual Number

Sanskrit has a dual number in addition to singular and plural. This is used for naturally occurring pairs or when referring to exactly two of something:

**एकः** (ekaḥ) - one
**द्वौ** (dvau) - two
**बहवः** (bahavaḥ) - many

Example:
**नरः** (naraḥ) - man (singular)
**नरौ** (narau) - two men (dual)
**नराः** (narāḥ) - men (plural)

### Honorific Forms

Sanskrit uses different pronouns and verb forms to show respect or formality:

Informal: **त्वं गच्छसि** (tvaṃ gacchasi) - “You go”
Formal: **भवान् गच्छति** (bhavān gacchati) - “You (respected one) go”

### Absolutives

Sanskrit has a special non-finite verb form called the absolutive, which expresses a completed action that precedes the main verb:

**भुक्त्वा गच्छामि** (bhuktvā gacchāmi) - “Having eaten, I go”

### Causatives

Verbs can be modified to express causation:

**पठति** (paṭhati) - “He reads”

### Denominal Verbs

Verbs can be derived from nouns:

**पुत्र** (putra) - “son”
**पुत्रीयति** (putrīyati) - “He treats like a son”

## Phonological Rules

### Vowel Gradation (Guṇa and Vṛddhi)

Sanskrit has a system of vowel gradation called guṇa and vṛddhi:

Basic vowel: **इ** (i)
Guṇa: **ए** (e)
Vṛddhi: **ऐ** (ai)

This is used in various grammatical processes, such as forming causatives or certain noun declensions.

### Ablaut

Similar to other Indo-European languages, Sanskrit exhibits ablaut, a system of vowel alternations in related words or different grammatical forms of the same word:

**बुध्** (budh) - “to wake”
Present tense: **बोधति** (bodhati)
Perfect tense: **बुबोध** (bubodha)
Past participle: **बुद्ध** (buddha)

## Semantic Features

### Figurative Language

Sanskrit literature is rich in figurative language, including various types of metaphors (रूपक, rūpaka) and similes (उपमा, upamā):

**मुखं चन्द्र इव** (mukhaṃ candra iva) - “Face like the moon” (simile)

**कर्मन्** (karman) - action, deed

### Technical Vocabulary

Sanskrit has been used to develop technical vocabularies in various fields:

**अङ्क** (aṅka) - digit, mathematical term
**बीज** (bīja) - seed, also used in algebra for “coefficient”
**धातु** (dhātu) - element, used in Ayurveda (traditional medicine)

## Dialectal Variations

While Classical Sanskrit is highly standardized, there are some variations:

### Vedic Sanskrit

The older form of the language, used in the Vedas, has some distinct features:

- Additional verb tenses (like the aorist)
- Different case endings in some instances
- Pitch accent (which was lost in Classical Sanskrit)

Example (Vedic accent marked):
**अ॒ग्निमी᳚ळे पु॒रोहि॑तम्** (agnimī́ḷe purohitam)

### Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit

A form of Sanskrit used in some Buddhist texts, showing influence from Middle Indo-Aryan languages:

**बोधिसत्त्व** (bodhisattva) instead of Classical **बोधिसत्त्व** (bodhisattva)

## Writing System

While Devanagari is the most common script for writing Sanskrit today, historically it has been written in various scripts:

- Brāhmī (ancient script)
- Various regional scripts of India (Bengali, Telugu, etc.)
- Tibetan script (for Buddhist texts)
- Southeast Asian scripts (Thai, Khmer, etc. for religious texts)

Example in Grantha script (used in South India):
𑌨𑌮𑌸𑍍𑌤𑍇 (namaste)
