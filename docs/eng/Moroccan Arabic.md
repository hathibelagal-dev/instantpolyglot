# Moroccan Arabic

Moroccan Arabic, also known as Darija, is a variety of Maghrebi Arabic spoken in Morocco. It is the primary spoken language for most Moroccans, used in daily life, media, and informal settings. Moroccan Arabic differs significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Moroccan Arabic has a rich consonant inventory, including some sounds not found in MSA:

| IPA | Romanization | Description |
|-----|--------------|-------------|
| [b] | b | voiced bilabial stop |
| [m] | m | bilabial nasal |
| [f] | f | voiceless labiodental fricative |
| [t] | t | voiceless dental stop |
| [d] | d | voiced dental stop |
| [tˤ] | ṭ | emphatic voiceless dental stop |
| [dˤ] | ḍ | emphatic voiced dental stop |
| [n] | n | dental nasal |
| [s] | s | voiceless alveolar fricative |
| [z] | z | voiced alveolar fricative |
| [sˤ] | ṣ | emphatic voiceless alveolar fricative |
| [ʃ] | sh | voiceless postalveolar fricative |
| [ʒ] | j | voiced postalveolar fricative |
| [l] | l | alveolar lateral |
| [r] | r | alveolar trill |
| [k] | k | voiceless velar stop |
| [g] | g | voiced velar stop |
| [q] | q | voiceless uvular stop |
| [χ] | kh | voiceless uvular fricative |
| [ʁ] | gh | voiced uvular fricative |
| [ħ] | ḥ | voiceless pharyngeal fricative |
| [ʕ] | ʿ | voiced pharyngeal fricative |
| [h] | h | voiceless glottal fricative |
| [ʔ] | ʾ | glottal stop |

### Vowels

Moroccan Arabic has a simpler vowel system compared to MSA:

| IPA | Romanization | Description |
|-----|--------------|-------------|
| [a] | a | open front unrounded vowel |
| [i] | i | close front unrounded vowel |
| [u] | u | close back rounded vowel |
| [ə] | e | mid central vowel (schwa) |

The schwa [ə] is often inserted between consonants to break up clusters.

### Phonological processes

1. Vowel reduction: Unstressed vowels often reduce to schwa or are dropped entirely.
   Example: **ktab** [ktəb] "book" (MSA: **kitāb** [kitaːb])

2. Consonant clusters: Moroccan Arabic allows for complex consonant clusters.
   Example: **khdmt** [χdəmt] "I worked" (MSA: **ʿamiltu** [ʕamiltu])

3. Emphatic consonants: Like MSA, Moroccan Arabic has emphatic consonants that affect surrounding vowels.
   Example: **ṭabla** [tˤabla] "table" vs. **tabla** [tabla] "drum"

## Orthography

Moroccan Arabic is primarily a spoken language and does not have a standardized writing system. It is often written informally using Arabic script, Latin script, or a mixture of both. When written in Arabic script, short vowels are typically omitted.

Example in Arabic script: الدار البيضاء
Romanization: **ed-dar el-beyḍa** ("Casablanca")

## Morphology

### Nouns

Nouns in Moroccan Arabic have two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural).

1. Gender:
   - Masculine nouns typically end in a consonant
   - Feminine nouns often end in -a
   Example: **wld** (boy) vs. **bnt** (girl)

2. Plural formation:
   - Sound plural: add -in (masculine) or -at (feminine)
   Example: **mʿallm** (teacher) → **mʿallmin** (teachers)
   - Broken plural: internal vowel changes
   Example: **ktab** (book) → **ktub** (books)

3. Definite article:
   The definite article is **l-**, which assimilates to some following consonants.
   Example: **l-bab** (the door), **sh-shms** (the sun)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | **ana**  | **ḥna** |
| 2nd    | **nta** (m), **nti** (f) | **ntuma** |
| 3rd    | **huwa** (m), **hiya** (f) | **huma** |

Possessive suffixes:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | -i       | -na    |
| 2nd    | -k       | -kum   |
| 3rd    | -u (m), -ha (f) | -hum |

Example: **dar** (house)
- **dari** (my house)
- **darna** (our house)
- **daru** (his house)

### Verbs

Moroccan Arabic verbs have a rich system of derivation and inflection.

1. Verb forms:
   - Form I: basic form (e.g., **ktb** "to write")
   - Form II: intensive/causative (e.g., **kttb** "to make write")
   - Form III: reciprocal (e.g., **katb** "to correspond with")
   - Other forms exist but are less common

2. Tenses and aspects:
   - Perfect: completed action
   - Imperfect: ongoing or habitual action
   - Future: formed with prefix **ghadi** or **ghad**

3. Conjugation example (Form I verb **ktb** "to write"):

Perfect:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | **ktbt** | **ktbna** |
| 2nd    | **ktbti** | **ktbtu** |
| 3rd    | **ktb** (m), **ktbat** (f) | **ktbu** |

Imperfect:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | **kan-ktb** | **kan-ktbu** |
| 2nd    | **kat-ktb** | **kat-ktbu** |
| 3rd    | **kay-ktb** (m), **kat-ktb** (f) | **kay-ktbu** |

Future:
**ghadi n-ktb** (I will write)
**ghadi t-ktb** (You will write)
**ghadi y-ktb** (He will write)

4. Imperative:
   Formed by using the imperfect stem without prefixes.
   Example: **ktb** (Write!)

### Particles and Function Words

1. Negation:
   Verbs are negated using the circumfix **ma-...-sh**
   Example: **ma-ktbt-sh** (I didn't write)

2. Question words:
   - **shnu** (what)
   - **fin** (where)
   - **shkun** (who)

## Syntax

1. Word order:
   The basic word order is VSO (Verb-Subject-Object), but SVO is also common.
   Example:
   **kla Moḥamed l-khubz** (Mohamed ate the bread) - VSO
   **Moḥamed kla l-khubz** (Mohamed ate the bread) - SVO

2. Possession:
   Expressed using the construct state (idafa) or with the particle **dyal**.
   Examples:
   **dar l-wld** (the boy's house)
   **d-dar dyal l-wld** (the house of the boy)

3. Adjectives:
   Adjectives follow the noun they modify and agree in gender and number.
   Example: **dar kbira** (big house, feminine)

4. Demonstratives:
   Demonstratives come after the noun.
   Examples:
   **had l-ktab** (this book)
   **dak l-ktab** (that book)

5. Relative clauses:
   Formed using the relative pronoun **lli**.
   Example: **r-rajl lli shft l-barḥ** (the man whom I saw yesterday)

## Vocabulary

Moroccan Arabic vocabulary is influenced by several languages:

1. Classical Arabic:
   Many words are derived from Classical Arabic but may have undergone phonological changes.
   Example: **ktab** (book) from Classical Arabic **kitāb**

2. Berber languages:
   As the indigenous languages of North Africa, Berber languages have contributed many words.
   Example: **aftas** (bald) from Berber

3. French:
   Due to the French protectorate period, many French loanwords are used.
   Example: **tobic** (topic) from French "topic"

4. Spanish:
   Especially in northern Morocco, Spanish has influenced the vocabulary.
   Example: **simana** (week) from Spanish "semana"

5. English:
   Modern technology and global culture have introduced English words.
   Example: **weekend** (weekend)

Some common Moroccan Arabic words and phrases:

- **slam ʿlikum** - Hello (peace be upon you)
- **labas?** - How are you?
- **shukran** - Thank you
- **smḥ li** - Excuse me
- **bghit** - I want

## Dialectal Variation

Moroccan Arabic has several regional dialects:

1. Northern dialects (e.g., Tangier, Tetouan):
   More influenced by Spanish and retaining some features of Andalusian Arabic.

2. Central dialects (e.g., Casablanca, Rabat):
   Often considered the standard form of Moroccan Arabic.

3. Eastern dialects (e.g., Oujda):
   Closer to Algerian Arabic.

4. Southern dialects (e.g., Marrakech):
   More influenced by Berber languages.

Examples of dialectal differences:

- "Now": **daba** (Central), **druk** (Northern)
- "Come": **ajiu** (Central), **arwaḥu** (Southern)

## Colloquial Features

1. Shortening of words:
   Many words are shortened in everyday speech.
   Example: **ma ʿndish** → **ma ʿndish** (I don't have)

2. Code-switching:
   Moroccan speakers often mix Darija with French or Spanish.
   Example: **ʿndi rendez-vous mʿa l-medcin** (I have an appointment with the doctor)

3. Idiomatic expressions:
   - **lla y-ʿawn** (May God help) - used as "good luck"
   - **lla y-khllík** (May God keep you) - used as "please"
   - **b-sḥḥa** (With health) - used as "enjoy your meal" or "you're welcome"

5. Emphatic repetition:
   Repeating words for emphasis is common.
   Example: **bzzaf bzzaf** (very very much)

## Phonological Variations in Colloquial Speech

1. Vowel reduction:
   Unstressed vowels are often reduced or omitted in fast speech.
   Example: **katbti** → **ktbti** (you wrote)

2. Consonant assimilation:
   Adjacent consonants often assimilate in connected speech.
   Example: **mn Rabat** → **m Rabat** (from Rabat)

3. Glottal stop insertion:
   A glottal stop is sometimes inserted between vowels in careful speech.
   Example: **saʿa** → **saʿʾa** (hour)

## Grammatical Features in Colloquial Usage

1. Analytic genitive:
   The use of **dyal** for possession is more common in colloquial speech than the construct state.
   Example: **l-ktab dyal l-wld** (the boy's book) instead of **ktab l-wld**

2. Verb serialization:
   Multiple verbs can be used in sequence without conjunctions.
   Example: **msha ja** (he went and came)

3. Topic-comment structure:
   A topic is often introduced at the beginning of a sentence and then commented on.
   Example: **l-wld, shftu l-barḥ** (The boy, I saw him yesterday)

4. Use of active participles:
   Active participles are often used instead of imperfect verbs for ongoing actions.
   Example: **ana gals** (I am sitting) instead of **ana kan-gls**

5. Diminutives:
   Diminutives are commonly used for endearment or to indicate smallness.
   Example: **bnita** (little girl) from **bnt** (girl)

## Sociolinguistic Aspects

1. Diglossia:
   Moroccan Arabic coexists with Modern Standard Arabic, which is used in formal contexts, education, and media.

   Speakers often switch between Moroccan Arabic, MSA, French, and sometimes Spanish or English.

3. Register variation:
   Different registers are used depending on the social context, from very colloquial to more formal varieties closer to MSA.

4. Language attitudes:
   While Moroccan Arabic is the primary spoken language, it is often viewed as less prestigious than MSA or French in certain contexts.

5. Language policy:
