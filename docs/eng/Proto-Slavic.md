# Proto-Slavic

Proto-Slavic is the hypothetical ancestor language of all modern Slavic languages. It was spoken approximately between 500 BCE and 500 CE, though exact dates are uncertain. Proto-Slavic was never written down, but linguists have reconstructed much of its phonology, morphology, and vocabulary through comparative analysis of its descendant languages.

## Phonology

Proto-Slavic had a rich phonological system that underwent significant changes over time. The following reconstruction represents the late Proto-Slavic period (around 600 CE).

### Vowels

Proto-Slavic had the following vowel system:

| Short vowels | Long vowels |
|--------------|-------------|
| i, e, ь, a, ъ, u | i:, e:, ę, a:, ǫ, u: |

The vowels **ь** and **ъ** were ultra-short vowels known as yers. They were pronounced as very short [i] and [u] respectively.

The vowels **ę** and **ǫ** were nasal vowels, pronounced approximately as [ɛ̃] and [ɔ̃].

Examples:
- **sъnъ** [sŭnŭ] “sleep, dream”
- **pętь** [pɛ̃tĭ] “five”
- **rǫka** [rɔ̃ka] “hand”

### Consonants

Proto-Slavic had the following consonant system:

| Labial | Dental/Alveolar | Palatal | Velar |
|--------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| p b | t d | | k g |
| | s z | | x |
| | c | | |
| m | n | ń | |
| v | l r | j | |

Additionally, there were palatalized variants of most consonants, represented in reconstructions with an acute accent (´) or apostrophe ('). For example:

- **t'** [tʲ]
- **s'** [sʲ]
- **n'** [nʲ]

Examples:
- **nebo** [nebo] “sky, heaven”
- **zemja** [zemʲa] “earth, land”
- **kurъ** [kurŭ] “rooster”

### Prosody

Proto-Slavic had a pitch accent system, with each word having one accented syllable. The accent could be either rising or falling, and could occur on any syllable of the word. This system is partially preserved in some modern Slavic languages, such as Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian.

Examples (acute accent represents rising tone, grave accent represents falling tone):
- **vòda** “water”
- **gor̀a** “mountain”
- **golová** “head”

## Morphology

Proto-Slavic was a highly inflected language, with complex systems of declension and conjugation.

### Nouns

Nouns in Proto-Slavic were declined for three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), three numbers (singular, dual, plural), and seven cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, vocative).

Example declension of **synъ** “son” (o-stem masculine):

| Case | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| Nom. | **synъ** | **syna** | **synove** |
| Acc. | **synъ** | **syna** | **syny** |
| Gen. | **synu** | **synu** | **synъ** |
| Dat. | **synovi** | **synoma** | **synomъ** |
| Ins. | **synъmь** | **synoma** | **synъmi** |
| Loc. | **syně** | **synu** | **syněxъ** |
| Voc. | **syne** | **syna** | **synove** |

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Proto-Slavic had both short (nominal) and long (pronominal) forms. They agreed with the nouns they modified in gender, number, and case.

Example declension of **novъ** “new” (short form, masculine singular):

| Case | Form |
|------|------|
| Nom. | **novъ** |
| Acc. | **novъ** |
| Gen. | **nova** |
| Dat. | **novu** |
| Ins. | **novъmь** |
| Loc. | **nově** |

### Verbs

Proto-Slavic verbs were conjugated for person (1st, 2nd, 3rd), number (singular, dual, plural), tense (present, aorist, imperfect), mood (indicative, imperative, conditional), and aspect (perfective, imperfective).

Example conjugation of **nesti** “to carry” in the present tense:

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **nesǫ** | **nesevě** | **nesemъ** |
| 2nd | **neseši** | **neseta** | **nesete** |
| 3rd | **nesetь** | **nesete** | **nesǫtь** |

### Pronouns

Proto-Slavic had a system of personal, demonstrative, interrogative, and relative pronouns. Personal pronouns were declined for case but not gender.

Example declension of the first-person singular pronoun:

| Case | Form |
|------|------|
| Nom. | **azъ** |
| Acc. | **mę** |
| Gen. | **mene** |
| Dat. | **mьně** |
| Ins. | **mъnojǫ** |
| Loc. | **mьně** |

### Numerals

Proto-Slavic had a complex system of numerals, with different forms for cardinal and ordinal numbers. The numbers 1-4 were declined as adjectives, while higher numbers were treated as nouns.

Examples:
- **edinъ** “one”
- **dъva** “two”
- **trьje** “three”
- **četyre** “four”
- **pętь** “five”

## Syntax

Proto-Slavic syntax was relatively flexible due to its extensive case system, but the default word order was likely Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).

### Word Order

While the word order was flexible, certain tendencies existed:

1. Adjectives typically preceded the nouns they modified.
2. Genitives usually followed the nouns they modified.
3. Demonstratives and possessives generally preceded their nouns.

Example:
**mojь dobrъjь synъ** “my good son”

### Case Usage

The rich case system in Proto-Slavic allowed for various syntactic functions:

1. Nominative case was used for the subject of a sentence.
   Example: **človĕkъ idetь** “The man goes”

2. Accusative case marked the direct object.
   Example: **viždǫ domъ** “I see a house”

3. Genitive case indicated possession or partitive meaning.
   Example: **synъ otьca** “son of the father”

4. Dative case marked the indirect object or the recipient of an action.
   Example: **dajǫ jemu kъnigǫ** “I give him a book”

5. Instrumental case expressed means or accompaniment.
   Example: **pišǫ perъmь** “I write with a quill”

6. Locative case indicated location (always used with prepositions).
   Example: **vъ domě** “in the house”

7. Vocative case was used for direct address.
   Example: **bože!** “O God!”

### Verb Aspect

Proto-Slavic had a developed aspectual system, distinguishing between perfective and imperfective verbs. This distinction was often marked by prefixes or suffixes:

- Imperfective: **pisati** “to write (ongoing action)”
- Perfective: **napisati** “to write (completed action)”

### Participles and Verbal Nouns

Proto-Slavic had a rich system of participles and verbal nouns:

1. Present active participle: **nesǫtj-** “carrying”
2. Past active participle: **nesъš-** “having carried”
3. Present passive participle: **nesomъ** “being carried”
4. Past passive participle: **nesenъ** “having been carried”
5. Verbal noun: **nesenje** “the act of carrying”

These forms were used in various syntactic constructions, often replacing subordinate clauses in modern languages.

## Vocabulary

    - **korlь** “king” (from the name of Charlemagne)

## Sound Changes

Proto-Slavic underwent several significant sound changes that differentiated it from its Indo-European ancestors and led to the development of the modern Slavic languages. Some of the most important changes include:

1. Satemization: The Indo-European palatovelar consonants became sibilants.
   Example: PIE **k̂mtóm* > PS **sъto** “hundred”

2. RUKI rule: *s* became *x* after *r*, *u*, *k*, and *i*.
   Example: PIE **ausōs* > PS **uxo** “ear”

3. Winter's law: Voiced stops were lengthened and their following vowels shortened in certain environments.
   Example: PIE **sed-* > PS **sěděti** “to sit”

4. Liquid metathesis: In some Slavic dialects, syllabic liquids *r* and *l* moved before or after adjacent vowels.
   Example: PS **gord-* > South Slavic **grad-*, East and West Slavic **gorod-* “city”

5. Law of open syllables: All syllables became open (ending in a vowel).
   Example: PS **synъ** from earlier **sunus* “son”

6. Palatalization: Velar consonants became palatalized before front vowels, resulting in various sibilants and affricates.
   First palatalization: *k* > *č*, *g* > *ž*, *x* > *š* before *e*, *ě*, *i*, *ь*
   Example: PS **otьče** (vocative) from **otьkъ** “father”

   Second palatalization: *k* > *c*, *g* > *dz* (> *z*), *x* > *s* before *ě* and *i* of diphthongal origin
   Example: PS **cěna** from earlier **kaina* “price”

   Third (progressive) palatalization: *k* > *c*, *g* > *dz* (> *z*), *x* > *s* after *i*, *ь*, *ę* (in some cases)
   Example: PS **otьcь** from earlier **otьkъ** “father”

7. Monophthongization: Diphthongs were simplified into monophthongs.
   Example: PIE **oi* > PS **ě**

8. Prothesis: Addition of *v-* or *j-* before initial *u-* and *i-* respectively.
   Example: PIE **ud-* > PS **voda** “water”

These sound changes, along with others, shaped the phonological system of Proto-Slavic and laid the foundation for the diverse sound systems of modern Slavic languages.

## Dialectal Variation

While Proto-Slavic is reconstructed as a relatively uniform language, there were likely dialectal differences, especially in its later stages. These differences eventually led to the formation of the three main branches of Slavic languages:

1. West Slavic (including Polish, Czech, Slovak)
2. East Slavic (including Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian)
3. South Slavic (including Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian)

Some early dialectal features include:

1. Treatment of consonant clusters *tl* and *dl*:
   - Simplified to *l* in South and East Slavic
   - Retained in West Slavic
   Example: PS **vedlъ* > South/East Slavic **velъ**, West Slavic **vedl** “led” (masculine singular past tense)

2. Development of nasal vowels:
   - Retained longest in Polish and some Bulgarian dialects
   - Lost early in East Slavic
   Example: PS **pętь** > Polish **pięć**, Russian **пять** [pʲatʲ] “five”

3. Treatment of initial *je-*:
   - Became *o-* in East Slavic
   - Retained as *je-* in West and South Slavic
   Example: PS **jezerо** > Russian **озеро**, Polish **jezioro** “lake”

4. Development of *tj* and *dj* clusters:
   - Became *št* and *žd* in Bulgarian and Macedonian
   - Became *ć* and *đ* in Serbo-Croatian
   - Became *c* and *z* in West Slavic
   Example: PS **svĕtja** > Bulgarian **свеща** [svɛʃtɐ], Serbo-Croatian **svijeća** [sʋijět͡ɕa], Czech **svíce** [sviːt͡sɛ] “candle”

5. Treatment of *tort*, *tolt*, *tert*, *telt* sequences (where *t* represents any consonant):
   - Metathesis in South Slavic: *trat*, *tlat*, *trět*, *tlět*
   - Pleophony in East Slavic: *torot*, *tolot*, *teret*, *telet*
   - Metathesis with vowel lengthening in West Slavic: *trāt*, *tlāt*, *trēt*, *tlēt*
   Example: PS **gordъ* > Serbo-Croatian **grad**, Russian **город** [ˈɡorəd], Polish **gród** [ɡrut] “city”

## Innovations and Developments

Proto-Slavic introduced several innovations that distinguished it from other Indo-European languages:

1. Development of aspect:
   Proto-Slavic developed a systematic aspectual distinction between perfective and imperfective verbs, which is preserved in modern Slavic languages.
   Example: PS **dělati** (imperfective) vs. **sъdělati** (perfective) “to do”

2. Animacy distinction:
   Proto-Slavic began to develop a grammatical distinction between animate and inanimate nouns, particularly in the masculine gender. This is reflected in the use of the genitive case form for animate accusatives.
   Example: PS **viděti synъ** (animate) vs. **viděti domъ** (inanimate) “to see a son” vs. “to see a house”

3. Dual number:
   While the dual was inherited from Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Slavic preserved and even extended its use, creating a full set of dual forms for nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs.
   Example: PS **dva stola** “two tables” (nominative/accusative dual)

4. Development of definiteness:
   Late Proto-Slavic began to develop a distinction between short (indefinite) and long (definite) forms of adjectives, which evolved into the definite/indefinite distinction in some modern Slavic languages.
   Example: PS **novъ** (short) vs. **novъjь** (long) “new”

5. Simplification of the verbal system:
   Proto-Slavic simplified the complex Indo-European verbal system, losing some categories (like the perfect tense) and developing new ones (like the imperfect tense).
   Example: PS imperfect **nesěaxъ** “I was carrying”

## Sample Texts

While Proto-Slavic was never written down, we can reconstruct short texts based on our understanding of the language. Here are some example sentences with their approximate pronunciations and translations:

1. **Čьto jestь člověkъ?** [tʃĭto jestĭ tʃlověkŭ]
   “What is a human?”

2. **Otьcь našь, iže jesi na nebesьxъ** [otĭtsĭ naʃĭ iʒe jesi na nebesĭxŭ]
   “Our father, who art in heaven” (beginning of the Lord's Prayer)

3. **Dъva na desęte učenika idǫtь sъ učiteljemь svojimь** [dŭva na desęte utʃenika idǫtĭ sŭ utʃiteljemĭ svojimĭ]
   “Twelve disciples go with their teacher”

4. **Vьsi človĕci roždajǫtь sę svobodьni i ravьni vъ dostoinьstvĕ i pravĕxъ** [vĭsi tʃlověci roʒdajǫtĭ sę svobodĭni i ravĭni vŭ dostoinĭstvě i pravěxŭ]
   “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights” (from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights)

5. **Kъde jestь grodъ? Grodъ jestь za rĕkojǫ i prĕdъ gorami** [kŭde jestĭ grodŭ grodŭ jestĭ za rěkojǫ i prědŭ gorami]
   “Where is the city? The city is beyond the river and before the mountains”

## Lexical Fields and Semantic Development

## Influence on Modern Slavic Languages

The legacy of Proto-Slavic is evident in all modern Slavic languages. While each language has undergone its own developments, many core features of Proto-Slavic remain recognizable:

1. Phonology:
   - The inventory of consonants and vowels in most Slavic languages is still quite similar to Proto-Slavic.
   - The results of palatalizations are visible in all Slavic languages, though with different outcomes.

2. Morphology:
   - The case system is largely preserved in most Slavic languages, though some (like Bulgarian and Macedonian) have lost it.
   - The aspect system continues to be a defining feature of Slavic verbs.
   - Many declension and conjugation patterns can be traced back to Proto-Slavic forms.

3. Syntax:
   - The relatively free word order, enabled by the case system, is still a feature of many Slavic languages.
   - The use of aspect in complex tense formations is common across Slavic.

4. Vocabulary:
   - A large portion of the core vocabulary in all Slavic languages can be traced back to Proto-Slavic roots.
   - Cognates are easily recognizable across Slavic languages, facilitating some degree of mutual intelligibility.

5. Phonological processes:
   - Many phonological processes that began in Proto-Slavic (like the law of open syllables) have shaped the phonotactics of modern Slavic languages.
