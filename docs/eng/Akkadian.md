# Akkadian

Akkadian is an extinct East Semitic language that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq and Syria) from the 3rd millennium BCE until its gradual replacement by Aramaic beginning in the 8th century BCE. It was named after the city of Akkad and served as the lingua franca of the Ancient Near East for many centuries. Akkadian was written using cuneiform script, adapted from the earlier Sumerian writing system.

## Writing System

Akkadian was written using cuneiform script, which consists of wedge-shaped impressions made on clay tablets. The script is logographic-syllabic, meaning it uses both logograms (signs representing whole words) and syllabograms (signs representing syllables).

### Cuneiform Signs

There are several hundred cuneiform signs used in Akkadian writing. Some common signs include:

| Sign | Transliteration | Meaning |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| 𒀀 | a | water |
| 𒁹 | diš | one |
| 𒂗 | en | lord |
| 𒃻 | ša | of, which |
| 𒅆 | mu | name, year |
| 𒆠 | ki | place, earth |
| 𒈨 | me | plural marker |
| 𒉺 | pa | branch, leader |
| 𒊏 | ra | to go |
| 𒌷 | uru | city |

### Syllabic Values

Many signs have multiple possible readings. This polyvalence is a key feature of cuneiform writing. For example:

- 𒁉 can be read as **bi**, **be**, **pí**, or **pe**
- 𒄭 can be read as **ḫu**, **ḫum**, or **ḫub**
- 𒁀 can be read as **ba**, **pa**, or **wa**
- 𒀸 can be read as **aš**, **az**, **aṣ**, or **in**

The correct reading is determined by context and grammatical expectations.

### Determinatives

Determinatives are unpronounced signs used to indicate the category of the following word. They help clarify the meaning in a script that often has multiple possible readings for each sign. Some common determinatives include:

- 𒀭 (DINGIR) before divine names
  Example: 𒀭𒂗𒆤 **d**EN.ZU (the god Sin)

- 𒌷 (URU) before city names
  Example: 𒌷𒆠𒅆 URU**ki-mu** (the city of Kimu)

- 𒊩 (MUNUS) before female names or professions
  Example: 𒊩𒌆𒋫𒈨𒌍 MUNUS**šar-ra-tu-meš** (queens)

- 𒄑 (GIŠ) before wooden objects or trees
  Example: 𒄑𒈠 GIŠ**ma** (ship)

- 𒆠 (KI) after geographical names
  Example: 𒆳𒀸𒋩𒆠 KUR **aš-šur**KI (the land of Assyria)

### Logograms

Logograms are signs that represent entire words. Many logograms were borrowed from Sumerian. For example:

- 𒈗 (LUGAL) = **šarrum** “king”
- 𒂊 (E2) = **bītum** “house”
- 𒁷 (KÙ.BABBAR) = **kaspum** “silver”
- 𒃻 (ŠA3) = **libbum** “heart”

### Sample Text

Here's a more extended sample of Akkadian text in cuneiform with transliteration and translation:

𒁹𒄭𒄠𒈬𒊏𒁉 𒈗 𒃲 𒈗 𒆗𒉡 𒈗 𒆳𒀸𒋩𒆠 𒈗 𒆠𒂍𒊹𒊏 𒆠 𒈠𒀀𒋫 𒀀𒊏𒁀𒀀 𒅇 𒀝𒅗𒁲𒂊 𒈗 𒆠𒉻𒋫 𒀀𒊑𒁉𒂊𒋾 𒉺𒇻 𒆠𒁉𒊏𒀀𒋾

**1 ḫa-am-mu-ra-bi LUGAL GAL LUGAL dan-num LUGAL KUR aš-šur-KI LUGAL kiš-šat er-bé-et-tim ša-r ma-a-ta a-ra-bi-a ù ak-ka-di-i LUGAL kiš-ša-at ni-ši pa-li-iḫ ki-ib-ra-a-tim**

“Hammurabi, great king, mighty king, king of Assyria, king of the four quarters (of the world), king of the land of the Arabs and Akkadians, king of all peoples, reverent one of the (four) quarters”

This inscription showcases various features of Akkadian writing, including the use of logograms (e.g., LUGAL for “king”), determinatives (KUR for “land”), and syllabic spelling.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Akkadian had the following consonant phonemes:

| Manner | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| Stop | p b | t d |  |  | k g | q | ʔ |
| Fricative | | | s z ṣ | š | ḫ |  | h |
| Nasal | m | n |  |  |  |  |  |
| Liquid |  |  | l r |  |  |  |  |
| Glide | w |  |  | y |  |  |  |

Notes on consonants:
- The phoneme /ṣ/ was an emphatic consonant, likely realized as [sˤ].
- The exact nature of /ḫ/ is debated, but it was likely a voiceless velar or uvular fricative.
- The glottal stop /ʔ/ was not consistently represented in writing.

### Vowels

Akkadian had four vowel qualities:

| Front | Back |
|-------|------|
| i | u |
| e | a |

Vowel length was phonemic, with each vowel having a short and long version. Long vowels are typically represented in transliteration with a macron (ā, ē, ī, ū).

Examples of minimal pairs:
- **šarrum** “king” vs. **šārum** “wind”
- **ilu** “god” vs. **īlu** “they went up”

### Phonological Processes

1. Vowel Harmony: In Old Babylonian, the vowel of some prefixes and suffixes harmonized with the vowel of the root. This process affected mainly the prefix vowels of verbs. For example:
   - **iprus** “he decided” vs. **ipqid** “he appointed”
   - **uparrис** “he separated” vs. **uparris** “he separated”

2. Assimilation: Consonants often assimilated to adjacent consonants. This process was particularly common with nasals and stops:
   - /nb/ → [mb]: **inbi** → **imbi** “he named”
   - /nt/ → [nd]: **imtaḫar** → **imdaḫar** “he received”
   - /np/ → [mp]: **inpur** → **impur** “he sent”

3. Syncope: Short vowels in open syllables often dropped in certain environments:
   - **kalabum** → **kalbum** “dog”
   - **awilum** → **awlum** “man”

4. Vowel Contraction: When two vowels came into contact due to morphological processes, they often contracted:
   - /a+u/ → [û]: **ša uldu** → **šūldu** “which he bore”
   - /i+a/ → [ê]: **ši'āmum** → **šêmum** “to buy”

5. Consonant Weakening: Certain consonants, particularly /w/, /y/, and /ʔ/, often weakened or disappeared in certain positions:
   - **awīlum** → **amīlum** “man” (in Assyrian)
   - **ra'āmum** → **râmum** “to love”

6. Stress: While not marked in writing, stress in Akkadian was likely penultimate in most cases, with some exceptions:
   - **šár-rum** “king”
   - **i-pár-ras** “he decides”

These phonological processes played a crucial role in shaping the morphology and phonotactics of Akkadian, and understanding them is key to comprehending the language's historical development and dialectal variations.

## Morphology

Akkadian is a highly inflected language with a rich system of affixes for nouns, adjectives, and verbs. Its morphological system is typical of Semitic languages, with roots consisting of (usually) three consonants that carry the basic semantic meaning, while vowel patterns and affixes provide grammatical information.

### Nouns

Nouns in Akkadian are inflected for gender (masculine and feminine), number (singular, dual, and plural), and case (nominative, accusative, and genitive).

#### Gender

Most nouns have inherent gender, but some suffixes can change gender:
- **-um** (masc.): **šarrum** “king”
- **-tum** (fem.): **šarratum** “queen”
- **-ūtum** (abstract nouns, often feminine): **šarrūtum** “kingship”

Some nouns can be either masculine or feminine:
- **ūmum** “day” (usually masculine)
- **šattum** “year” (usually feminine)

#### Number

- Singular: unmarked
- Dual: **-ān** (oblique cases), **-ā** (nominative)
  Example: **šēpān** “two feet” (oblique), **šēpā** “two feet” (nominative)
- Plural:
  - Masculine: **-ū** (nominative), **-ī** (oblique)
  - Feminine: **-ātum** (nominative), **-ātim** (oblique)

Some nouns have irregular plurals:
- **ilum** “god” → **ilū** / **ilī** “gods”
- **awīlum** “man” → **awīlū** / **awīlī** “men”
- **ālum** “city” → **ālānū** / **ālānī** “cities”

#### Case

Akkadian has three cases:
- Nominative: **-um** (sing.), **-ū** (masc. pl.), **-ātum** (fem. pl.)
- Accusative: **-am** (sing.), **-ī** (masc. pl.), **-ātim** (fem. pl.)
- Genitive: **-im** (sing.), **-ī** (masc. pl.), **-ātim** (fem. pl.)

Example declension of **šarrum** “king”:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | šarr-um | šarr-ū |
| Accusative | šarr-am | šarr-ī |
| Genitive | šarr-im | šarr-ī |

#### Construct State

When a noun is followed by a genitive, it takes a special form called the construct state:
- Masculine singular: **-u** (all cases)
- Feminine singular: **-at** (all cases)
- Masculine plural: **-ū** (nom.), **-ī** (acc./gen.)
- Feminine plural: **-āt** (all cases)

Example:
- **bīt šarrim** “the house of the king” (construct **bīt** from **bītum**)
- **mārāt šarrim** “the daughters of the king” (construct **mārāt** from **mārātum**)

### Adjectives

Adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case. They generally follow the same declension patterns as nouns.

Example: **dannum** “strong” (masc. sing. nom.)
- **dannutum** “strong” (fem. sing. nom.)
- **dannūtum** “strong” (masc. pl. nom.)
- **dannātum** “strong” (fem. pl. nom.)

Comparative and superlative forms are usually expressed through syntax rather than morphology:
- **dannum eli aḫḫīšu** “stronger than his brothers” (lit. “strong compared to his brothers”)
- **dannum ina aḫḫīšu** “strongest among his brothers” (lit. “strong among his brothers”)

### Pronouns

#### Personal Pronouns

Independent personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | anāku | nīnu |
| 2nd masc. | atta | attunu |
| 2nd fem. | atti | attina |
| 3rd masc. | šū | šunu |
| 3rd fem. | šī | šina |

#### Possessive Suffixes

Possessive suffixes are attached directly to nouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | -ī | -ni |
| 2nd masc. | -ka | -kunu |
| 2nd fem. | -ki | -kina |
| 3rd masc. | -šu | -šunu |
| 3rd fem. | -ša | -šina |

Example:
- **bītum** “house”
- **bītī** “my house”
- **bītka** “your (masc. sing.) house”
- **bītšunu** “their (masc.) house”

#### Demonstrative Pronouns

Akkadian has several demonstrative pronouns:
- **annûm** (masc.), **annītum** (fem.) “this”
- **ullûm** (masc.), **ullītum** (fem.) “that”

These decline for case and number:
- **annûm** (nom.), **anniam** (acc.), **annim** (gen.)

#### Relative Pronoun

The relative pronoun in Akkadian is **ša**, which is indeclinable:
- **awīlum ša illkam** “the man who came”

### Verbs

Akkadian verbs are highly complex, with inflections for person, gender, number, tense, mood, and voice. The basic verb stem consists of three consonants (the root), with various affixes added to create different forms.

#### Verb Stems

There are several verb stems in Akkadian, each with a different nuance:

1. G-stem (basic stem): **parāsum** “to decide”
2. D-stem (intensive): **purrusum** “to separate”
3. Š-stem (causative): **šuprusum** “to make decide”
4. N-stem (passive): **naprusum** “to be decided”
5. t-stems (reflexive/reciprocal):
   - Gt-stem: **pitrusum** “to decide for oneself”
   - Dt-stem: **putarrusum** “to be separated”
   - Št-stem: **šutaprusum** “to make decide one another”

#### Conjugation

Verbs are conjugated for person, gender, and number using prefixes and suffixes. Here's the full G-stem preterite (past tense) conjugation for **parāsum** “to decide”:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | aprus | niprus |
| 2nd masc. | taprus | taprusā |
| 2nd fem. | taprusī | taprusā |
| 3rd masc. | iprus | iprusū |
| 3rd fem. | taprus | iprusā |

The present tense (also used for future) conjugation follows a different pattern:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | aparras | niparras |
| 2nd masc. | taparras | taparrasā |
| 2nd fem. | taparrasī | taparrasā |
| 3rd masc. | iparras | iparrasū |
| 3rd fem. | taparras | iparrasā |

Note the doubling of the second radical consonant in the present tense.

#### Tenses/Aspects

Akkadian has several tenses/aspects:

1. Preterite (past perfective): **iprus** “he decided”
2. Present (present-future): **iparras** “he decides/will decide”
3. Perfect (past with present relevance): **iptaras** “he has decided”
4. Stative (resultative): **paris** “he is/was in a state of having decided”

The stative is unique in that it uses suffixes rather than prefixes for person marking:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | pars-āku | pars-ānu |
| 2nd masc. | pars-āta | pars-ātunu |
| 2nd fem. | pars-āti | pars-ātina |
| 3rd masc. | paris | pars-ū |
| 3rd fem. | pars-at | pars-ā |

#### Moods

1. Indicative (unmarked)
2. Imperative: **purus** “decide!”
3. Precative (polite command): **liprus** “may he decide”
4. Vetitive (negative command): **ay iprus** “let him not decide”
5. Cohortative (1st person command): **i niprus** “let us decide”

The imperative has its own conjugation:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 2nd masc. | purus | purusā |
| 2nd fem. | purusī | purusā |

#### Participles

Akkadian has active and passive participles:
- Active: **pārisum** “deciding”
- Passive: **parsum** “decided”

These decline like adjectives:
- **pārisum** (masc. sing. nom.), **pāristum** (fem. sing. nom.), **pārisūtum** (masc. pl. nom.)

#### Infinitive

The infinitive is formed by adding **-um** to the verb stem:
- **parāsum** “to decide”

It can be declined like a noun:
- **ana parāsim** “in order to decide” (dative)
- **ina parāsim** “while deciding” (locative)

#### Verbal Adjective

The verbal adjective is similar to the passive participle but describes a state rather than an action:
- **parsum** “decided, separate”

It declines like an adjective and can be used predicatively:
- **awīlum parsum** “a separated man”
- **awīlum paris** “the man is separated”

### Numerals

Akkadian has a complex system of numerals, with different forms for cardinal and ordinal numbers, as well as special constructions for counted nouns.

#### Cardinal Numbers

1-10 in Akkadian:

1. **ištēn** (m.), **išteat** (f.)
2. **šinā** (m.), **šittā** (f.)
3. **šalāš**
4. **erbe**
5. **ḫamiš**
6. **šediš**
7. **sebe**
8. **samāne**
9. **tiše**
10. **ešer**

Numbers 11-19 are formed by combining the unit with **-šeret** “ten”:
- 11: **ištēnšeret**
- 12: **šinšeret**

Tens are formed with the suffix **-ā**:
- 20: **ešrā**
- 30: **šalāšā**
- 40: **erbā**

Hundreds use the word **meat**:
- 100: **meat**
- 200: **šinā meat**

#### Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal numbers are formed with the pattern **parus**:
- 1st: **maḫrûm**
- 2nd: **šanûm**
- 3rd: **šalšum**
- 4th: **rebûm**

#### Counted Nouns

When used with counted nouns, numbers behave in specific ways:
- 1: uses normal adjective agreement
- 2: uses a special construction: **2 + noun.dual**
  Example: **šinā šēpān** “two feet”
- 3-10: noun in plural, number follows in construct state
  Example: **šarrū šalāšat** “three kings”
- 11-19: noun in singular, number precedes
- 20 and above: noun in singular, number follows
  Example: **awīlum ešrā** “twenty men”

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Akkadian is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), but there is some flexibility due to the case system.

Example:
**šarrum ālaš ibni**
king-NOM city-ACC he-built
“The king built the city”

However, other orders are possible for emphasis or in specific constructions:

- OSV: **ālaš šarrum ibni** “It was the city that the king built”
- SVO: **šarrum ibni ālaš** “The king built (it), the city”

### Noun Phrases

Adjectives and genitives typically follow the noun they modify:

**bītum rabûm ša šarrim**
house-NOM large-NOM of king-GEN
“The large house of the king”

Multiple adjectives can be used:
**bītum rabûm dannum**
house-NOM large-NOM strong-NOM
“The large, strong house”

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by the relative pronoun **ša**:

**awīlum ša māram īmuru**
man-NOM who son-ACC saw
“The man who saw the son”

The relative pronoun **ša** is invariable and does not change for gender, number, or case. The verb in the relative clause agrees with its antecedent:

**sinništum ša māram tulid**
woman-NOM who son-ACC she-bore
“The woman who bore a son”

### Subordinate Clauses

Subordinate clauses often use the subjunctive mood and are introduced by conjunctions such as:

- **kīma** “that, because”
- **inūma** “when”
- **šumma** “if”

Example:
**šumma awīlum awīlam iššiak**
if man-NOM man-ACC strikes
“If a man strikes another man”

Temporal clauses often use the construct state of **ūm** “day” with a verb in the subjunctive:

**ūm ālam īrubū**
day-CONST city-ACC they-entered-SUBJ
“When they entered the city”

### Coordinate Clauses

Coordinate clauses are often simply juxtaposed without a conjunction:

**šarrum īliam ālaš ibni**
king-NOM he-arose city-ACC he-built
“The king arose and built the city”

The conjunction **-ma** can be used to connect clauses, often implying a sequence of events:

**šarrum īliam-ma ālaš ibni**
king-NOM he-arose-and city-ACC he-built
“The king arose and then built the city”

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed with the particle **lā** before the verb:

**šarrum ālaš lā ibni**
king-NOM city-ACC not he-built
“The king did not build the city”

In prohibitions, **lā** is used with the perfect:
**lā taptaras**
not you-have-decided
“You must not decide”

### Questions

Yes-no questions are often identical to statements, with only intonation differentiating them. The particle **ul** can be used for negative questions:

**ul illiam**
not he-arose
“Did he not arise?”

Wh-questions use interrogative words such as:
- **mannum** “who”
- **mīnum** “what”
- **ayyum** “which”

These usually come at the beginning of the sentence:

**mannum ālaš ibni**
who city-ACC built
“Who built the city?”

### Infinitive Constructions

Infinitives can be used in various constructions, often with prepositions:

**ana ālim erēbim illiam**
to city-GEN enter-INF-GEN he-arose
“He arose to enter the city”

### Stative Constructions

The stative can be used to express resultative or stative meanings:

**bābum petī**
door-NOM open-STAT
“The door is open”

It can also be used with adjectives:
**šarrum dannat**
king-NOM strong-STAT.3SG.F
“The king is strong”

This extensive overview of Akkadian syntax showcases the complexity and richness of the language's grammatical structures. Understanding these patterns is crucial for reading and interpreting Akkadian texts accurately.
