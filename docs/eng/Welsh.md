# Welsh

Welsh (Cymraeg) is a Celtic language spoken by approximately 880,000 people, primarily in Wales, a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It belongs to the Brythonic branch of the Celtic languages, closely related to Cornish and Breton. Welsh has a rich history dating back to the 6th century and has experienced a revival in recent decades, with increasing numbers of speakers and a strong presence in education and media.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Welsh uses the Latin alphabet with 29 letters, including eight digraphs (ch, dd, ff, ng, ll, ph, rh, th) which are treated as single letters. The language has a largely phonetic spelling system, meaning that words are generally pronounced as they are written, though there are some exceptions and complexities.

### Vowels

Welsh has both short and long vowels. The length of a vowel can change the meaning of a word.

| Letter | Sound (short) | Sound (long) |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| a | [a] as in "cat" | [aː] as in "father" |
| e | [ɛ] as in "pet" | [eː] as in "play" |
| i | [ɪ] as in "bit" | [iː] as in "meet" |
| o | [ɔ] as in "pot" | [oː] as in "boat" |
| u | [ɨ] (no English equivalent) | [ɨː] (longer version) |
| w | [ʊ] as in "put" | [uː] as in "boot" |
| y | [ə] as in "about" or [ɨ] | [əː] or [ɨː] |

The letter "y" can represent different sounds depending on its position in a word and the dialect.

### Consonants

Most consonants are pronounced similarly to English, with some notable exceptions:

| Letter/Digraph | Sound |
|----------------|-------|
| c | Always [k], never [s] |
| ch | [x] (like Scottish "loch") |
| dd | [ð] (like "th" in "this") |
| f | [v] |
| ff | [f] |
| g | Always hard [ɡ], never [dʒ] |
| ll | [ɬ] (voiceless lateral fricative) |
| r | Rolled [r] |
| rh | Voiceless rolled [r̥] |

### Stress

In Welsh, the stress is usually on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable of a word. For example:

- **cy-mraeg** [kəmˈraiɡ] (Welsh)
- **llo-frud-diog** [ɬɔˈvridyɔɡ] (murderous)

However, there are some exceptions, particularly with words borrowed from English.

### Mutations

One of the most distinctive features of Welsh is its system of initial consonant mutations. These are changes to the first consonant of a word based on grammatical context. There are three types of mutations:

1. Soft Mutation (Treiglad Meddal)
2. Nasal Mutation (Treiglad Trwynol)
3. Aspirate Mutation (Treiglad Llaes)

Here's a table showing how certain consonants change under each mutation:

| Original | Soft | Nasal | Aspirate |
|----------|------|-------|----------|
| p | b | mh | ph |
| t | d | nh | th |
| c | g | ngh | ch |
| b | f | m | - |
| d | dd | n | - |
| g | - | ng | - |
| m | f | - | - |
| ll | l | - | - |
| rh | r | - | - |

For example, the word **pen** (head) can become:

- **ben** (soft mutation): **Fy mhen** (My head)
- **phen** (aspirate mutation): **Ei phen** (Her head)
- **mhen** (nasal mutation): **Ym mhen** (In (the) head)

Mutations occur in various grammatical contexts, such as after certain prepositions, possessive adjectives, or in compound words.

## Morphology

### Nouns

Welsh nouns have two genders: masculine and feminine. Unlike many Indo-European languages, Welsh does not have a neuter gender. The gender of a noun affects the forms of associated adjectives and can trigger mutations.

Plurals in Welsh are formed in various ways:

1. Changing the vowel:
   - **carreg** (stone) → **cerrig** (stones)
   - **march** (horse) → **meirch** (horses)

2. Adding a suffix:
   - **cath** (cat) → **cathod** (cats)
   - **tŷ** (house) → **tai** (houses)

3. Combination of vowel change and suffix:
   - **plentyn** (child) → **plant** (children)

4. Irregular plurals:
   - **ci** (dog) → **cŵn** (dogs)

Welsh also has a system of collective nouns and singulatives. For some nouns, particularly those referring to small objects or animals, the base form is plural, and a suffix (usually -yn for masculine or -en for feminine) is added to form the singular:

- **moch** (pigs) → **mochyn** (a pig)
- **adar** (birds) → **aderyn** (a bird)

### Articles

Welsh has no indefinite article equivalent to English "a" or "an". The definite article "the" is **y** before consonants and **yr** before vowels:

- **y ci** (the dog)
- **yr afon** (the river)

The form **'r** is used after a word ending in a vowel:
- **mae'r ci** (the dog is)

### Adjectives

Adjectives usually follow the noun they modify:

- **ci mawr** (big dog)
- **tŷ gwyn** (white house)

Adjectives can show agreement with the noun in gender and number:

- **merch dal** (tall girl)
- **bachgen tal** (tall boy)
- **bechgyn talion** (tall boys)

Some common adjectives have distinct feminine forms:

- **mawr** (big, masculine) → **fawr** (big, feminine)
- **gwyn** (white, masculine) → **wen** (white, feminine)

Comparative and superlative forms are typically formed by adding suffixes:

- **tal** (tall) → **talach** (taller) → **talaf** (tallest)
- **da** (good) → **gwell** (better) → **gorau** (best)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Welsh change form based on their function in the sentence:

| Person | Subject | Object | Possessive |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1sg | i | fi | fy |
| 2sg | ti/chi | ti/chi | dy/eich |
| 3sg m | ef/fe | ef/fe | ei |
| 3sg f | hi | hi | ei |
| 1pl | ni | ni | ein |
| 2pl | chi | chi | eich |
| 3pl | nhw | nhw | eu |

The second person singular has formal (chi) and informal (ti) forms.

Possessive pronouns trigger different mutations:

- **fy** + soft mutation: **fy nghath** (my cat)
- **dy** + soft mutation: **dy gath** (your cat)
- **ei** (his) + soft mutation: **ei gath** (his cat)
- **ei** (her) + aspirate mutation: **ei chath** (her cat)

### Numbers

Welsh has a vigesimal (base-20) number system, which can make larger numbers complex. Here are the basic numerals:

| Number | Welsh |
|--------|-------|
| 1 | un |
| 2 | dau/dwy |
| 3 | tri/tair |
| 4 | pedwar/pedair |
| 5 | pump |
| 6 | chwech |
| 7 | saith |
| 8 | wyth |
| 9 | naw |
| 10 | deg |
| 11 | un ar ddeg |
| 12 | deuddeg |
| 13 | tri ar ddeg |
| 14 | pedwar ar ddeg |
| 15 | pymtheg |
| 16 | un ar bymtheg |
| 17 | dau ar bymtheg |
| 18 | deunaw |
| 19 | pedwar ar bymtheg |
| 20 | ugain |

Numbers from 21 to 39 are formed by adding units to 20:

- 21: **un ar hugain** (one on twenty)
- 22: **dau ar hugain** (two on twenty)

40 is **deugain** (two twenties), and numbers between 40 and 59 are formed similarly:

- 41: **un a deugain** (one and two twenties)

60 is **trigain** (three twenties), and so on.

Welsh has different forms for some numbers depending on the gender of the noun they're counting:

- 2: **dau** (masc.) / **dwy** (fem.)
- 3: **tri** (masc.) / **tair** (fem.)
- 4: **pedwar** (masc.) / **pedair** (fem.)

## Verbs

Welsh verbs are complex, with conjugations varying based on tense, person, and number. There are two main ways of forming sentences in Welsh: verb-noun constructions and inflected verbs.

### Verb-Noun Constructions

These are the most common in spoken Welsh. They use the verb **bod** (to be) as an auxiliary, followed by the subject and then the verb-noun:

- **Dw i'n canu** (I am singing)
- **Mae hi'n canu** (She is singing)

### Inflected Verbs

These are more common in formal or literary Welsh. The verb changes form to indicate person and tense:

- **Canaf** (I sing/will sing)
- **Canodd hi** (She sang)

### Tenses

Welsh has several tenses and aspects, including:

1. Present: 
   - **Dw i'n canu** (I am singing)
   - **Canaf** (I sing)

2. Imperfect:
   - **Roeddwn i'n canu** (I was singing)
   - **Canwn** (I used to sing)

3. Preterite:
   - **Ces i ganu** (I sang)
   - **Canais** (I sang)

4. Perfect:
   - **Dw i wedi canu** (I have sung)

5. Pluperfect:
   - **Roeddwn i wedi canu** (I had sung)
   - **Canaswn** (I had sung)

6. Future:
   - **Byddaf yn canu** (I will be singing)
   - **Canaf** (I will sing)

7. Conditional:
   - **Byddwn i'n canu** (I would sing)
   - **Canwn** (I would sing)

### The Verb "bod" (to be)

The verb "bod" is irregular and is used both as a main verb and an auxiliary. Here are some of its forms:

Present:
- **dw i** (I am)
- **wyt ti** (you are, informal)
- **mae e/o** (he is)
- **mae hi** (she is)
- **ydyn ni** (we are)
- **ydych chi** (you are, plural/formal)
- **maen nhw** (they are)

Imperfect:
- **roeddwn i** (I was)
- **roeddet ti** (you were, informal)
- **roedd e/o** (he was)
- **roedd hi** (she was)
- **roedden ni** (we were)
- **roeddech chi** (you were, plural/formal)
- **roedden nhw** (they were)

Future:
- **byddaf i** (I will be)
- **byddi di** (you will be, informal)
- **bydd e/o** (he will be)
- **bydd hi** (she will be)
- **byddwn ni** (we will be)
- **byddwch chi** (you will be, plural/formal)
- **byddan nhw** (they will be)

### Aspect: "Gwneud" (to do/make) as an Auxiliary

Welsh often uses the verb "gwneud" as an auxiliary to emphasize or question an action:

- **Gwnes i ganu** (I did sing)
- **Wnes ti ganu?** (Did you sing?)

### Mood

Welsh has several moods, including indicative, subjunctive, and imperative.

Imperative (command form):
- **Cana!** (Sing! - singular)
- **Canwch!** (Sing! - plural/formal)

### Verbal Nouns

Welsh uses verbal nouns extensively. These function similarly to infinitives or gerunds in English:

- **canu** (to sing/singing)
- **rhedeg** (to run/running)
- **bwyta** (to eat/eating)

## Syntax

Welsh is a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) language in its basic structure, although the verb-noun constructions commonly used in spoken Welsh often result in SVO order.

### Basic Sentence Structure

1. VSO order with inflected verbs:
   - **Gwelodd Siân y ci** (Siân saw the dog)

2. Verb-noun constructions:
   - **Mae Siân yn gweld y ci** (Siân is seeing the dog)

### Questions

Questions can be formed in several ways:

1. By using question words:
   - **Beth wyt ti'n wneud?** (What are you doing?)
   - **Pwy yw e?** (Who is he?)

2. By using the interrogative form of "bod":
   - **Wyt ti'n hoffi coffi?** (Do you like coffee?)
   - **Ydych chi'n siarad Cymraeg?** (Do you speak Welsh?)

3. By intonation (in colloquial speech):
   - **Ti'n mynd?** (Are you going?)

### Negation

Negation is typically formed using **ddim**:

- **Dw i ddim yn hoffi coffi** (I don't like coffee)
- **Fydd e ddim yn dod** (He won't come)

Some verbs have specific negative forms:
- **Mae** (is) → **Dydy... ddim** (is not)
- **Oes** (there is) → **Does... ddim** (there isn't)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by **sy** or **sydd**:

- **Y dyn sy'n canu** (The man who is singing)
- **Y llyfr sydd ar y bwrdd** (The book that is on the table)

### Possession

Possession can be expressed in several ways:

1. Using the possessive pronouns:
   - **fy nhŷ** (my house)
   - **ei char hi** (her car)

2. Using the possessive construction with "gan":
   - **Mae car gan Siân** (Siân has a car, literally "There is a car with Siân")

3. Using the construct state (more formal):
   - **tŷ'r athro** (the teacher's house)

### Emphasis

Welsh allows for emphasis by fronting different parts of the sentence:

- Normal: **Mae Siân yn byw yng Nghaerdydd** (Siân lives in Cardiff)
- Emphatic: **Yng Nghaerdydd mae Siân yn byw** (It's in Cardiff that Siân lives)

### Impersonal Constructions

Welsh often uses impersonal constructions where English might use passive voice:

- **Gwelwyd y ci** (The dog was seen, literally "One saw the dog")

## Vocabulary

Welsh vocabulary has been influenced by various languages throughout its history, includingLatin, English, and other Celtic languages. Here are some examples of vocabulary from different sources:

1. Native Celtic words:
   - **tad** (father)
   - **mam** (mother)
   - **afon** (river)
   - **mynydd** (mountain)
   - **cariad** (love)

2. Latin loanwords (often through religious influence):
   - **eglwys** (church, from Latin "ecclesia")
   - **ffenestr** (window, from Latin "fenestra")
   - **pont** (bridge, from Latin "pons")
   - **ysgol** (school, from Latin "schola")

3. English loanwords:
   - **trên** (train)
   - **tacsi** (taxi)
   - **ffôn** (phone)
   - **siop** (shop)

4. French loanwords (often via English):
   - **siambr** (chamber)
   - **fferm** (farm)
   - **parc** (park)

Many Welsh words have cognates in other Celtic languages, particularly Breton and Cornish. For example:

- Welsh **pen** (head), Breton **penn**, Cornish **pen**
- Welsh **dŵr** (water), Breton **dour**, Cornish **dowr**

Welsh has also contributed some words to English, including:
- "corgi" (from Welsh **cor** "dwarf" + **ci** "dog")
- "bard" (from Welsh **bardd**)
- "penguin" (possibly from Welsh **pen gwyn** "white head")

### Word Formation

Welsh forms new words through various means:

1. Compounding:
   - **prifysgol** (university) from **prif** (main) + **ysgol** (school)
   - **trydan** (electricity) from **trwd** (turn) + **tân** (fire)

2. Affixation:
   - Prefixes: **an-** (un-), **cyd-** (co-), **rhag-** (pre-)
     Example: **anhapus** (unhappy) from **an-** + **hapus** (happy)
   - Suffixes: **-wr** (male agent), **-wraig** (female agent), **-fa** (place)
     Example: **athro** (male teacher), **athrawes** (female teacher)

3. Borrowing and adapting:
   - **cyfrifiadur** (computer) from **cyfrif** (to count) + **-iadur** (instrument suffix)

### Idiomatic Expressions

Welsh has many colorful idiomatic expressions:

- **Mae hi'n bwrw hen wragedd a ffyn** (It's raining old women and sticks) - It's raining heavily
- **Fel arfer** (As usual) - Usually
- **Diolch yn fawr** (Thank you big) - Thank you very much
- **Nos da** (Good night) - Literally "Night good"

## Dialects

Welsh has two main dialect groups: Northern (Gogledd) and Southern (De) Welsh. While they are mutually intelligible, there are noticeable differences in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.

### Northern Welsh

Characteristics of Northern dialects include:

1. Pronunciation:
   - The sound [ɨ] (similar to Russian ы) is used instead of [ɪ] in some words
   - Words like **llaeth** (milk) are pronounced with two syllables: [ɬaɨθ]

2. Vocabulary:
   - **fo** instead of **fe** for "he"
   - **rŵan** instead of **nawr** for "now"

3. Grammar:
   - Use of **'di** instead of **wedi** in perfect constructions:
     **Dw i 'di gweld** instead of **Dw i wedi gweld** (I have seen)

### Southern Welsh

Features of Southern dialects include:

1. Pronunciation:
   - The sound [ɪ] is used where Northern dialects use [ɨ]
   - Words like **llaeth** are pronounced with one syllable: [ɬaiθ]

2. Vocabulary:
   - **e** or **fe** instead of **fo** for "he"
   - **nawr** instead of **rŵan** for "now"

3. Grammar:
   - More frequent use of the present tense ending **-ith**:
     **Gwelith e** instead of **Gwêl e** (He sees)

### Standard Welsh

A standardized form of Welsh, sometimes called Cymraeg Byw (Living Welsh), is used in formal contexts, media, and education. It aims to bridge the gap between major dialects while maintaining the language's richness.

## Phonology

Welsh phonology has several distinctive features:

### Consonants

Welsh has a number of consonants not found in English:

1. Voiceless lateral fricative [ɬ], spelled "ll":
   - **llaeth** [ɬaiθ] (milk)
   - **llan** [ɬan] (church)

2. Voiceless alveolar trill [r̥], spelled "rh":
   - **rhaid** [r̥aid] (must)
   - **rhed** [r̥ɛd] (run)

3. Voiceless nasals [m̥], [n̥], [ŋ̊], occurring in consonant mutations:
   - **fy mhen** [və m̥ɛn] (my head)
   - **fy nhrwyn** [və n̥rʊɨn] (my nose)

### Vowels

Welsh has both short and long vowels, and the length can be phonemic (changing the meaning of a word):

- **tân** [taːn] (fire) vs. **tan** [tan] (until)
- **mẁg** [muːɡ] (mug) vs. **mwg** [mʊɡ] (smoke)

The vowel [ə] (schwa) occurs only in unstressed syllables.

### Diphthongs

Welsh has several diphthongs, including:

- **ae** [ai]: **cae** [kai] (field)
- **aw** [au]: **maw** [mau] (thumb)
- **ew** [ɛu]: **tew** [tɛu] (fat)
- **wy** [ʊi]: **mwy** [mʊi] (more)

### Stress

As mentioned earlier, stress in Welsh words typically falls on the penultimate syllable. However, there are exceptions:

- Some borrowed words maintain their original stress: **ambiwlans** [amˈbjulans] (ambulance)
- Some words have a stressed final syllable, marked with an accent: **canŵ** [kaˈnuː] (canoe)

### Phonotactics

Welsh allows for consonant clusters both at the beginning and end of syllables:

- Initial clusters: **sgwrs** [sɡʊrs] (conversation), **stryd** [strɨːd] (street)
- Final clusters: **milltir** [mɪɬtɪr] (mile), **plant** [plant] (children)

## Writing System

Welsh uses the Latin alphabet with 29 letters, including eight digraphs that are treated as single letters:

a, b, c, ch, d, dd, e, f, ff, g, ng, h, i, j, l, ll, m, n, o, p, ph, r, rh, s, t, th, u, w, y

The letters k, q, v, x, and z are not used in native Welsh words but may appear in borrowed terms.

### Diacritics

Welsh uses two diacritical marks:

1. Circumflex (ˆ): Used to denote a long vowel:
   - **tân** [taːn] (fire)
   - **tŷ** [tiː] (house)

2. Grave accent (`): Used occasionally to denote a short vowel where confusion might otherwise arise:
   - **mẁg** [mʊɡ] (mug)

### Capitalization

Welsh follows similar capitalization rules to English, with some exceptions:

- Days of the week and months are not capitalized:
  **dydd Llun** (Monday), **mis Ionawr** (January)

- Languages and nationalities are not capitalized:
  **cymraeg** (Welsh language), **saesneg** (English language)

### Mutations in Writing

Initial consonant mutations are always reflected in writing:

- Soft mutation: **car** → **gar**
- Nasal mutation: **car** → **nghar**
- Aspirate mutation: **car** → **char**

## Formal and Informal Language

Welsh, like many languages, has distinctions between formal and informal language use:

### Personal Pronouns

The second person singular has two forms:

- Informal: **ti**
- Formal: **chi** (also used for plural "you")

### Verb Forms

Some verbs have distinct formal and informal forms, particularly in the imperative:

- Informal: **Tyrd yma** (Come here - to one person)
- Formal/Plural: **Dewch yma** (Come here - to multiple people or formally to one person)

### Titles and Forms of Address

Formal titles are used in polite conversation:

- **Mr** (abbreviation of **Mister**)
- **Mrs** (abbreviation of **Mistress**)
- **Ms**
- **Dr** (abbreviation of **Doctor**)

### Register

Formal Welsh tends to use more inflected verb forms and complex sentence structures, while informal Welsh often relies more on periphrastic constructions.

## Language Status and Revitalization

Welsh has undergone a significant revitalization process over the past century. After a period of decline, several measures have been taken to promote and protect the language:

1. Welsh Language Acts (1967, 1993, 2011): These acts have progressively strengthened the status of Welsh, mandating its use in public services and establishing the role of the Welsh Language Commissioner.

2. Education: Welsh-medium education has expanded greatly, with options available from nursery through university level.

3. Media: S4C, a Welsh-language television channel, was established in 1982. There are also Welsh-language radio stations and a growing online presence.

4. Signage: Bilingual signs are now standard throughout Wales.

5. Technology: Welsh is supported by major tech companies, with Welsh-language interfaces available for many popular software applications and websites.

These efforts have resulted in an increase in the number of Welsh speakers, particularly among younger generations. However, challenges remain, particularly in maintaining Welsh as a community language in traditionally Welsh-speaking areas.
