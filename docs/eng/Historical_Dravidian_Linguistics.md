# Historical Dravidian Linguistics

The Dravidian language family consists of approximately 80 languages primarily spoken in southern India and neighboring regions. The major Dravidian languages include Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam. This overview focuses on the historical development and linguistic features of Proto-Dravidian and its descendants.

## Proto-Dravidian Reconstruction

Proto-Dravidian is the hypothetical ancestor of all Dravidian languages, believed to have been spoken around 4500-2500 BCE. Its reconstruction is based on comparative analysis of attested Dravidian languages.

### Phonology

The Proto-Dravidian phonological system is reconstructed as follows:

#### Consonants

| Place of Articulation | Stops | Nasals | Liquids | Approximants |
|-----------------------|-------|--------|---------|--------------|
| Labial                | p     | m      |         | v            |
| Dental                | t     | n      | r, l    |              |
| Alveolar              | R     | N      | L       |              |
| Retroflex             | T     | ṇ      | ẓ       |              |
| Palatal               | c     | ñ      |         | y            |
| Velar                 | k     | ṅ      |         |              |

Note: Capital letters represent alveolar consonants.

#### Vowels

| Short | Long |
|-------|------|
| a     | ā    |
| e     | ē    |
| i     | ī    |
| o     | ō    |
| u     | ū    |

### Morphology

Proto-Dravidian was an agglutinative language with a rich system of suffixes.

#### Nouns

Nouns were marked for case, number, and gender. The reconstructed case system includes:

1. Nominative (unmarked)
2. Accusative
3. Genitive
4. Dative
5. Locative
6. Ablative
7. Instrumental

Example of case marking in Proto-Dravidian:

| Case         | Form        | Meaning        |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Nominative   | **\*vil**   | 'bow'           |
| Accusative   | **\*vil-ay** | 'bow (object)'  |
| Genitive     | **\*vil-in** | 'of the bow'    |
| Dative       | **\*vil-kku** | 'to the bow'    |

#### Verbs

Proto-Dravidian verbs were marked for tense, aspect, mood, and person-number-gender agreement. The basic structure of a verb was:

Root + Tense/Aspect/Mood + Person-Number-Gender

Example of verb conjugation in Proto-Dravidian:

| Form               | Meaning            |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| **\*cey**          | 'do' (root)         |
| **\*cey-t-ēn**     | 'I did'             |
| **\*cey-v-āy**     | 'You will do'       |
| **\*cey-kiṟ-āḷ**   | 'She is doing'      |

### Syntax

Proto-Dravidian likely had a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, which is preserved in most modern Dravidian languages.

Example:
**\*avan maram kāṇ-t-ān**
he    tree   see-PAST-3SG.M
'He saw a tree'

## Historical Development

The Dravidian languages have undergone various changes since Proto-Dravidian. Some key developments include:

### Phonological Changes

1. Loss of word-final consonants in many languages
2. Development of voiced stops in some languages
3. Palatalization of velars before front vowels

Example from Tamil:
Proto-Dravidian **\*kaṇ** > Old Tamil **kaṇ** > Modern Tamil **kaṇ** [kɐɳ] 'eye'

### Morphological Changes

1. Simplification of the case system in some languages
2. Development of new tense-aspect-mood markers
3. Grammaticalization of certain verbs into auxiliaries

Example from Telugu:
Proto-Dravidian **\*pōk-um** 'will go' > Telugu **pō-tā-nu** 'I will go'

### Syntactic Changes

1. Development of relative clauses from participial constructions
2. Increased use of serial verb constructions in some languages
3. Influence of Indo-Aryan syntax on northern Dravidian languages

Example from Malayalam:
Old Malayalam: **vanna āḷ** 'the person who came'
Modern Malayalam: **vannatāya āḷ** 'the person who came'

## Major Dravidian Languages

### Tamil

Tamil is the oldest attested Dravidian language, with a rich literary tradition dating back to the 3rd century BCE.

#### Phonology

Tamil has preserved many features of Proto-Dravidian phonology, including:

1. Retention of the alveolar stop **ṯ** [t̪]
2. Preservation of the contrast between short and long vowels

## Dravidian Subgroups

The Dravidian language family is typically divided into four subgroups:

1. South Dravidian (e.g., Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada)
2. South-Central Dravidian (e.g., Telugu, Gondi)
3. Central Dravidian (e.g., Kolami, Parji)
4. North Dravidian (e.g., Brahui, Kurukh)

### South Dravidian

South Dravidian languages have preserved many features of Proto-Dravidian, including:

1. Retention of word-final consonants
2. Preservation of the alveolar stop in some languages
3. Complex system of verbal participles

Example from Old Tamil (3rd century BCE):
**yāṉ-ē kallāṯaṉ kaṟṟavar nāṇa**
I-EMPH ignorant learned-ones ashamed
'I alone am ignorant, to the shame of the learned ones'

### South-Central Dravidian

South-Central Dravidian languages have innovated in several ways:

1. Development of voiced stops
2. Loss of some Proto-Dravidian distinctions (e.g., alveolar/dental contrast)
3. Extensive use of compound verbs

Example from Old Telugu (11th century CE):
**ēnu ceḍḍa pani cēsitini**
I    bad   work did-1SG
'I did a bad deed'

### Central Dravidian

Central Dravidian languages show mixed features:

1. Retention of some archaic features (e.g., alveolar consonants)
2. Simplification of the case system
3. Influence from neighboring Indo-Aryan languages

Example from Kolami:
**nān kal tin-t-an**
I   stone eat-PAST-1SG
'I ate a stone'

### North Dravidian

North Dravidian languages have been heavily influenced by Indo-Aryan languages:

1. Adoption of Indo-Aryan phonological features
2. Borrowing of Indo-Aryan vocabulary
3. Influence on syntax (e.g., development of ergative constructions)

Example from Brahui:
**ī kitāb-te pāṛe**
this book-ACC read.PAST.1SG
'I read this book'

## Historical Sound Changes

Dravidian languages have undergone various sound changes over time. Some of the most significant changes include:

### Palatalization

In many Dravidian languages, velar consonants were palatalized before front vowels.

Example from Tamil:
Proto-Dravidian **\*kel-** 'to hear' > Old Tamil **kēḷ-** > Modern Tamil **kēḷ-** [keːɭ]

### Lenition

Intervocalic stops often underwent lenition, becoming approximants or being lost entirely.

Example from Malayalam:
Proto-Dravidian **\*mūk-** 'nose' > Old Malayalam **mūkku** > Modern Malayalam **mūkk** [muːkː]

### Vowel Harmony

Some Dravidian languages developed vowel harmony systems, where vowels in suffixes agree with the vowels in the root.

Example from Telugu:
**gudi** 'temple' + locative suffix **-lō** > **gudiloo** 'in the temple'
**illu** 'house' + locative suffix **-lō** > **illulo** 'in the house'

### Apocope

The loss of word-final vowels occurred in some languages, particularly in the South-Central and Central subgroups.

Example from Gondi:
Proto-Dravidian **\*kātu** 'ear' > Gondi **kāt**

## Grammaticalization Processes

Dravidian languages have undergone various grammaticalization processes, where lexical items develop grammatical functions.

### Auxiliary Verbs

Many Dravidian languages have developed complex systems of auxiliary verbs to express tense, aspect, and mood.

Example from Tamil:
**pōy koṇḍirukkiṟēṉ**
go.PTCP PROG.AUX.PRS.1SG
'I am going'

### Case Markers

Some postpositions have grammaticalized into case markers.

Example from Kannada:
Old Kannada **mane oḷage** 'inside the house' > Modern Kannada **maneyalli** 'in the house'

### Quotative Particles

Verbs of saying have grammaticalized into quotative particles in many Dravidian languages.

Example from Malayalam:
**avan varum ennu paṟaññu**
he come.FUT QUOT say.PAST
'He said that he would come'

## Syntactic Developments

Dravidian languages have undergone various syntactic changes over time.

### Relative Clause Formation

Many Dravidian languages have developed relative clauses from participial constructions.

Example from Tamil:
Old Tamil: **vanta āḷ** 'the person who came'
Modern Tamil: **vanta āḷ** (same form, but reanalyzed as a relative clause)

### Coordination

Coordination strategies have evolved in different ways across the family.

Example from Telugu:
**idi pustakamu mariyu adi pencil**
this book and that pencil
'This is a book and that is a pencil'

### Question Formation

Question particles and intonation patterns have developed to mark interrogatives.

Example from Kannada:
**nīvu yāvāga baruttīri?**
you when come.FUT.2PL.HON
'When will you come?'

## Lexical Innovations

Dravidian languages have developed new vocabulary through various processes.

### Compounding

New words are often formed by combining existing roots.

Example from Tamil:
**kaṇ** 'eye' + **āḍi** 'glass' > **kaṇṇāḍi** 'spectacles'

### Semantic Shift

Existing words have taken on new meanings over time.

Example from Malayalam:
**vaḷḷam** originally meant 'wood' but now primarily means 'boat'

### Borrowing

Dravidian languages have borrowed extensively from Sanskrit, Prakrit, and later from Persian, Arabic, and English.

Example from Telugu:
Sanskrit **pustaka** > Telugu **pustakamu** 'book'

## Script Development

Most major Dravidian languages have developed their own scripts, derived from the Brahmi script.

### Tamil Script

The Tamil script has remained relatively conservative, preserving many features of the original Brahmi.

Example:
**தமிழ்** (tamiḻ) 'Tamil'

### Malayalam Script

The Malayalam script diverged from the Tamil script around the 9th century CE.

Example:
**മലയാളം** (malayāḷam) 'Malayalam'

### Kannada Script

The Kannada script developed from the Old Kannada script, which was used for both Kannada and Telugu until about the 14th century.

Example:
**ಕನ್ನಡ** (kannaḍa) 'Kannada'

### Telugu Script

The Telugu script diverged from the Old Kannada script and developed its own distinctive features.

Example:
**తెలుగు** (telugu) 'Telugu'

## Influence on Non-Dravidian Languages

Dravidian languages have influenced neighboring language families, particularly Indo-Aryan languages.

### Phonological Influence

The retroflex consonants in Indo-Aryan languages are believed to have developed due to Dravidian influence.

Example from Sanskrit:
**वृक्ष** (vṛkṣa) [ʋrɨkʂɐ] 'tree'

### Syntactic Influence

Some syntactic features of Dravidian, such as the use of quotative constructions, have been adopted by Indo-Aryan languages.

Example from Marathi:
**to yeīl ase mhaṇāla**
he come.FUT QUOT say.PAST
'He said that he would come'

### Lexical Borrowing

Many words of Dravidian origin have entered Indo-Aryan languages.

Example:
Tamil **aracu** 'king' > Sanskrit **रा
