# Scottish Gaelic

Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig) is a Celtic language native to Scotland. It is part of the Goidelic branch of Celtic languages, closely related to Irish and Manx. Historically spoken throughout much of Scotland, it is now primarily used in the Highlands and Islands. As of 2011, there were approximately 57,000 speakers of Scottish Gaelic.

## Orthography

Scottish Gaelic uses an adapted version of the Latin alphabet, consisting of 18 letters:

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U

The letters J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, and Z are not used in native Gaelic words but may appear in loanwords.

### Vowels

Scottish Gaelic has both short and long vowels. Long vowels are indicated by a grave accent (`) over the vowel:

Short vowels: **a**, **e**, **i**, **o**, **u**
Long vowels: **à**, **è**, **ì**, **ò**, **ù**

Examples:
- **cas** [kas] (foot)
- **càs** [kɑːs] (difficulty)
- **te** [tʃʰe] (hot)
- **tè** [tʃʰeː] (woman)

### Consonants

Consonants in Scottish Gaelic can be broad (velarized) or slender (palatalized). This distinction is crucial for pronunciation and grammar.

Broad consonants are typically followed by **a**, **o**, or **u**.
Slender consonants are typically followed by **e** or **i**.

Examples:
- **bàta** [paːʰtə] (boat) - broad **b** and **t**
- **beag** [pek] (small) - slender **b** and **g**

### Consonant Clusters

Scottish Gaelic has several consonant clusters that represent single sounds:

- **bh**, **mh**: [v] or [w]
- **ch**: [x] or [ç]
- **dh**, **gh**: [ɣ] or [j]
- **fh**: silent
- **ph**: [f]
- **sh**, **th**: [h]

Examples:
- **bhàta** [vaːʰtə] (boat)
- **loch** [lɔx] (lake)
- **dhùin** [ɣuːɲ] (closed)
- **fhèin** [heːɲ] (self)
- **phòs** [fɔːs] (married)
- **sheinn** [heɲ] (sang)

## Phonology

Scottish Gaelic phonology is characterized by its distinction between broad and slender consonants, and its complex vowel system.

### Consonants

| Manner | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Plosive | p pʰ b | t̪ t̪ʰ d̪ | t tʰ d | tʃ tʃʰ dʒ | k kʰ ɡ | |
| Nasal | m | n̪ | n | ɲ | ŋ | |
| Fricative | f v | | s ʃ | ç j | x ɣ | h |
| Approximant | w | | l ɫ r | ʎ | | |

Monophthongs:
- Short: [a], [e], [i], [o], [u], [ə]
- Long: [aː], [eː], [iː], [oː], [uː]

Diphthongs: [ai], [au], [ia], [ua], [ui]

Examples:

- **dùn** [tuːn] (fort)
- **caileag** [kʰaʎak] (girl)
- **beul** [pial] (mouth)
- **ruadh** [ruəɣ] (red)

## Grammar

Scottish Gaelic is an inflected language with a complex grammar system. It features two genders, three cases (in most dialects), and verbal conjugations that vary based on tense, mood, and person.

### Nouns

Nouns in Scottish Gaelic have two genders (masculine and feminine) and can be inflected for case and number.

#### Gender

Gender in Scottish Gaelic is not always predictable, but there are some general patterns:

Masculine nouns often end in a broad consonant:
- **bàta** (boat)
- **taigh** (house)

Feminine nouns often end in a slender consonant:
- **caileag** (girl)
- **cearc** (hen)

#### Cases

Most dialects of Scottish Gaelic use three cases: nominative, genitive, and dative. Some conservative dialects retain a separate vocative case.

1. Nominative: Used for the subject of a sentence
2. Genitive: Used to show possession
3. Dative: Used after certain prepositions

Example of case declension for **balach** (boy):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **balach** | **balaich** |
| Genitive | **balaich** | **bhalach** |
| Dative | **balach** | **balaich** |

Example in a sentence:
- Nominative: **Tha am balach ag ithe.** (The boy is eating.)
- Genitive: **Tha peann a' bhalaich air a' bhòrd.** (The boy's pen is on the table.)
- Dative: **Thug mi leabhar don bhalach.** (I gave a book to the boy.)

#### Number

Nouns can be singular or plural. Plural formation in Scottish Gaelic can be complex, with several different patterns:

1. Adding a suffix (often -an):
   - **cù** (dog) → **còin** (dogs)
   - **caileag** (girl) → **caileagan** (girls)

2. Internal vowel change:
   - **fear** (man) → **fir** (men)
   - **bean** (woman) → **mnathan** (women)

3. Combination of internal change and suffix:
   - **bàta** (boat) → **bàtaichean** (boats)
   - **taigh** (house) → **taighean** (houses)

### Articles

Scottish Gaelic has both definite and indefinite articles.

The definite article has different forms depending on the gender, case, and initial sound of the noun it modifies:

| Gender | Case | Before Consonants | Before Vowels |
|--------|------|-------------------|---------------|
| Masculine | Nominative | **an** / **am** | **an t-** |
| | Genitive | **a'** | **an** |
| | Dative | **a'** | **an** |
| Feminine | Nominative | **an** / **a'** | **an** |
| | Genitive | **na** | **na h-** |
| | Dative | **an** / **a'** | **an** |

Examples:
- **an taigh** (the house)
- **a' chaileag** (the girl)
- **an t-iasg** (the fish)
- **na h-obrach** (of the work)

The indefinite article is **a** or **an** before a vowel:
- **a' balach** (a boy)
- **an iasg** (a fish)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Scottish Gaelic usually follow the noun they modify and agree with it in gender, case, and number.

Examples:
- **balach mòr** (big boy)
- **caileag bheag** (small girl)
- **taighean mora** (big houses)

Adjectives also have comparative and superlative forms:

- Positive: **mòr** (big)
- Comparative: **nas motha** (bigger)
- Superlative: **as motha** (biggest)

Example:
**Tha an taigh seo nas motha na an taigh sin.** (This house is bigger than that house.)

### Verbs

Scottish Gaelic verbs are conjugated for tense, mood, and person. The language uses a mixture of synthetic (one-word) and analytic (multi-word) forms.

#### Present Tense

The present tense is formed using the verbal noun with the auxiliary verb **bi** (to be):

**Tha mi ag òl uisge.** (I am drinking water.)
- **tha** - present tense of **bi**
- **mi** - I
- **ag** - at (particle used with verbal noun)
- **òl** - drinking (verbal noun)
- **uisge** - water

#### Past Tense

The past tense often involves lenition (softening) of the initial consonant:

**Dh'òl mi uisge.** (I drank water.)
- **dh'òl** - past tense of **òl** (drink)

#### Future Tense

The future tense is formed using the future form of the verb:

**Òlaidh mi uisge.** (I will drink water.)
- **òlaidh** - future tense of **òl**

#### Conditional Mood

The conditional mood is used for hypothetical situations:

**Dh'òlainn uisge.** (I would drink water.)
- **dh'òlainn** - conditional form of **òl**

#### Imperative Mood

The imperative mood is used for commands:

**Òl uisge!** (Drink water!)

### Prepositions

Scottish Gaelic has a rich system of prepositions, many of which can be inflected for person and number. These inflected forms are called prepositional pronouns.

Example with **aig** (at):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **agam** (at me) | **againn** (at us) |
| 2nd | **agad** (at you) | **agaibh** (at you pl.) |
| 3rd Masc. | **aige** (at him) | **aca** (at them) |
| 3rd Fem. | **aice** (at her) | |

Example in a sentence:
**Tha leabhar agam.** (I have a book. Literally: A book is at me.)

### Word Order

The basic word order in Scottish Gaelic is Verb-Subject-Object (VSO):

**Leugh an gille an leabhar.** (The boy read the book.)
- **leugh** - read (verb)
- **an gille** - the boy (subject)
- **an leabhar** - the book (object)

## Vocabulary

Scottish Gaelic vocabulary has been influenced by various languages throughout its history, including Old Irish, Latin, Norse, and English.

### Numbers

Cardinal numbers:

1. **aon**
2. **dà**
3. **trì**

## Dialects

Scottish Gaelic has several dialects, broadly divided into three groups:

1. Northern Dialects: Spoken in the Outer Hebrides and Skye
2. Western Dialects: Spoken in the Inner Hebrides and western mainland
3. Southern Dialects: Spoken in Argyll and Perthshire

These dialects can differ in pronunciation, vocabulary, and some grammatical features. For example:

- The word for “sun” is **grian** in most dialects, but **grèin** in some southern dialects.
- The future tense ending -idh is often pronounced as [i] in northern dialects but as [ɪç] in southern dialects.

## Lenition

Lenition is a important phonological process in Scottish Gaelic where certain consonants are “softened” in specific grammatical contexts. This is marked in writing by adding an “h” after the consonant. Not all consonants can be lenited.

Lenitable consonants and their lenited forms:

- b → bh [v]
- c → ch [x]
- d → dh [ɣ]
- f → fh (silent)
- g → gh [ɣ]
- m → mh [v]
- p → ph [f]
- s → sh [h]
- t → th [h]

Lenition occurs in various grammatical contexts, including:

1. After the definite article with feminine nouns in the nominative case:
   **a' chaileag** (the girl)

2. With masculine nouns in the genitive case:
   **taigh a' bhalaich** (the boy's house)

3. After certain prepositions:
   **air a' bhòrd** (on the table)

4. In the vocative case:
   **a Sheumais** (James!)

5. With adjectives modifying feminine nouns:
   **caileag bheag** (small girl)

6. In the past tense of many verbs:
   **bhris mi** (I broke)

## Eclipsis

While not as prominent as in Irish, eclipsis (or nasalization) does occur in some Scottish Gaelic dialects, particularly after the preposition **ann an** (in) and the numeral **seachd** (seven).

In eclipsis, the initial consonant of a word is replaced by its eclipsed form:

- b → m
- c → g
- d → n
- f → bh
- g → ng
- p → b
- t → d

Example:
**ann am baile** (in a town) - pronounced more like “ann am maile” in dialects with eclipsis

**seachd gcinn** (seven heads) - pronounced more like “seachd ginn”

It's important to note that eclipsis is not consistently represented in writing in Scottish Gaelic, unlike in Irish, and its use varies among dialects.

## Verb System

Scottish Gaelic has a complex verb system with both regular and irregular verbs. Here's a more detailed look:

### Regular Verbs

Regular verbs follow predictable patterns in their conjugations. Let's use the verb **dùin** (close) as an example:

1. Root form: **dùin**

2. Verbal Noun: **dùnadh**
   Used in progressive tenses: **Tha mi a' dùnadh an dorais.** (I am closing the door.)

3. Past Tense: **dhùin**
   **Dhùin mi an doras.** (I closed the door.)

4. Future Tense: **dùinidh**
   **Dùinidh mi an doras.** (I will close the door.)

5. Conditional: **dhùineadh**
   **Dhùineadh e an doras.** (He would close the door.)

6. Imperative: **dùin**
   **Dùin an doras!** (Close the door!)

### Irregular Verbs

Scottish Gaelic has 11 primary irregular verbs. These verbs don’t follow the regular patterns and must be memorized. Here are a few examples:

1. **bi** (to be)
   - Present: **tha**
   - Past: **bha**
   - Future: **bidh**
   - Conditional: **bhiodh**

   Example: **Tha mi sgìth.** (I am tired.)

2. **abair** (to say)
   - Present: **tha ... ag ràdh**
   - Past: **thuirt**
   - Future: **their**
   - Conditional: **theireadh**

   Example: **Thuirt e rium.** (He said to me.)

3. **thig** (to come)
   - Present: **tha ... a' tighinn**
   - Past: **thàinig**
   - Future: **thig**
   - Conditional: **thigeadh**

   Example: **Thàinig iad dhachaigh.** (They came home.)

### Dependent and Independent Forms

Scottish Gaelic verbs have dependent and independent forms. The independent form is used in simple statements, while the dependent form is used after particles like **cha** (not), **an** (question particle), and **nach** (negative question particle).

Example with **faic** (see):
- Independent (past): **chunnaic**
  **Chunnaic mi an cat.** (I saw the cat.)
- Dependent (past): **faca**
  **Cha fhaca mi an cat.** (I didn't see the cat.)
  **Am faca tu an cat?** (Did you see the cat?)

## Pronouns

Scottish Gaelic has a rich pronoun system, including personal pronouns, possessive pronouns, and emphatic pronouns.

### Personal Pronouns

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **mi** (I) | **sinn** (we) |
| 2nd | **thu** (you) | **sibh** (you pl.) |
| 3rd Masc. | **e** (he) | **iad** (they) |
| 3rd Fem. | **i** (she) | |

### Possessive Pronouns

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **mo** (my) | **ar** (our) |
| 2nd | **do** (your) | **ur** (your pl.) |
| 3rd Masc. | **a** (his) | **an** (their) |
| 3rd Fem. | **a** (her) | |

Possessive pronouns cause lenition of the following noun:
**mo chù** (my dog), **do thaigh** (your house)

### Emphatic Pronouns

Emphatic forms are created by adding suffixes to the personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **mise** | **sinne** |
| 2nd | **thusa** | **sibhse** |
| 3rd Masc. | **esan** | **iadsan** |
| 3rd Fem. | **ise** | |

Example: **'S e mise a rinn e.** (It's ME who did it.)

## Prepositional Pronouns

As mentioned earlier, many prepositions in Scottish Gaelic can be inflected for person and number. Here are a few more examples:

1. **le** (with)

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **leam** | **leinn** |
| 2nd | **leat** | **leibh** |
| 3rd Masc. | **leis** | **leotha** |
| 3rd Fem. | **leatha** | |

Example: **Thig leam.** (Come with me.)

2. **air** (on)

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **orm** | **oirnn** |
| 2nd | **ort** | **oirbh** |
| 3rd Masc. | **air** | **orra** |
| 3rd Fem. | **oirre** | |

Example: **Tha an leabhar orm.** (I have the book. Literally: The book is on me.)

## Adjectives

Adjectives in Scottish Gaelic usually come after the noun they modify and agree with the noun in gender, number, and case. Here are some additional details:

### Lenition of Adjectives

Adjectives are lenited in certain circumstances:

1. After feminine nouns in the nominative singular:
   **caileag bheag** (small girl)

2. After masculine nouns in the genitive singular:
   **dath an fheurr ghlais** (the color of the green grass)

3. In the vocative case:
   **a charaid chòir** (dear friend)

### Comparison of Adjectives

Comparative and superlative forms of adjectives are formed analytically in Scottish Gaelic:

- Positive: **mòr** (big)
- Comparative: **nas motha** (bigger)
- Superlative: **as motha** (biggest)

Example:
**Is e seo an taigh as motha anns a' bhaile.** (This is the biggest house in the town.)

Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms:

- **math** (good): **nas fheàrr** (better), **as fheàrr** (best)
- **dona** (bad): **nas miosa** (worse), **as miosa** (worst)

## Numbers and Counting

Scottish Gaelic has a vigesimal (base-20) counting system, which can be quite complex. Here's a more detailed look:

### Cardinal Numbers

11-19 are formed by adding **deug** (ten) after the unit:
11: **aon deug**
12: **dà dheug**
13: **trì deug**

20: **fichead**
21: **fichead 's a h-aon** (twenty and one)
22: **fichead 's a dhà**

30: **deich air fhichead** (ten on twenty)
40: **dà fhichead** (two twenties)
50: **leth-cheud** (half-hundred) or **dà fhichead 's a deich**

100: **ceud**
1000: **mìle**

### Counting Objects

When counting objects, the number usually comes before the noun, and the noun is in the singular form:

**trì taighean** (three houses)
**còig leabhraichean** (five books)

However, the numbers 1-10 have special forms used with nouns:

1: **aon taigh** (one house)
2: **dà thaigh** (two houses) - note the lenition
3: **trì taighean** (three houses)
4: **ceithir taighean** (four houses)
5: **còig taighean** (five houses)
6: **sia taighean** (six houses)
7: **seachd taighean** (seven houses)
8: **ochd taighean** (eight houses)
9: **naoi taighean** (nine houses)
10: **deich taighean** (ten houses)

## Syntax

Scottish Gaelic syntax has some unique features:

### Equative Sentences

To say “X is Y” in Scottish Gaelic, you use the construction “'S e ... a th' ann”:

**'S e tidsear a th' annam.** (I am a teacher. Literally: It's a teacher that is in me.)
**'S e baile mòr a th' ann an Glaschu.** (Glasgow is a big city. Literally: It's a big city that is in Glasgow.)

### Possession

Possession is often expressed using the preposition **aig** (at):

**Tha taigh agam.** (I have a house. Literally: A house is at me.)
**Tha càr aig Iain.** (John has a car. Literally: A car is at John.)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed using the particle **an** at the beginning of the sentence:

**An toil leat cofaidh?** (Do you like coffee?)

Negative questions use **nach**:

**Nach eil thu ag iarraidh biadh?** (Don’t you want food?)

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns:

**Cò** (who): **Cò thusa?** (Who are you?)
**Dè** (what): **Dè tha thu ag iarraidh?** (What do you want?)
**Càite** (where): **Càite bheil thu a' fuireach?** (Where do you live?)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Scottish Gaelic are introduced by **a**:

**an duine a tha a' bruidhinn** (the man who is speaking)
**am baile anns a bheil mi a' fuireach** (the town in which I live)

This overview covers many of the key aspects of Scottish Gaelic grammar and structure, but like any language, there are many nuances and exceptions that come with practice and exposure to the language in use.
