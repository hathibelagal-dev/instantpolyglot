# Swedish

Swedish (svenska) is a North Germanic language spoken by approximately 10 million people, primarily in Sweden and parts of Finland. It belongs to the East Scandinavian branch of the Germanic languages and is closely related to Norwegian and Danish, with a high degree of mutual intelligibility between these Scandinavian languages. Swedish is the most widely spoken Nordic language and serves as an official language in Sweden and Finland.

## Phonology and Pronunciation

Swedish has a rich sound system with several phonemes that may be challenging for non-native speakers. The language features a variety of vowel and consonant sounds, as well as distinctive prosodic features.

### Vowels

Swedish has 9 vowel phonemes, each of which can be pronounced short or long. The length distinction is phonemic, meaning it can change the meaning of words.

| Letter | Short | Long | Example (short) | Example (long) |
|--------|-------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| a | [a] | [ɑː] | **katt** [kat] (cat) | **mat** [mɑːt] (food) |
| e | [ɛ] | [eː] | **hett** [hɛt] (hot) | **vet** [veːt] (knows) |
| i | [ɪ] | [iː] | **vitt** [vɪt] (white) | **vi** [viː] (we) |
| o | [ɔ] | [uː] | **bott** [bɔt] (lived) | **bo** [buː] (to live) |
| u | [ɵ] | [ʉː] | **putt** [pɵt] (put) | **hus** [hʉːs] (house) |
| y | [ʏ] | [yː] | **mygg** [mʏɡ] (mosquito) | **by** [byː] (village) |
| å | [ɔ] | [oː] | **håll** [hɔl] (hold) | **år** [oːr] (year) |
| ä | [ɛ] | [ɛː] | **häll** [hɛl] (slab) | **här** [hɛːr] (here) |
| ö | [œ] | [øː] | **höst** [hœst] (autumn) | **öl** [øːl] (beer) |

Some additional notes on vowels:
- The distinction between [ɛ] and [e] is neutralized before [r], both becoming [æ].
- In some dialects, particularly in southern Sweden, the [ʉː] sound may be pronounced more like [ʏː].
- The letter “o” can represent both [ɔ]/[oː] and [u]/[uː], depending on the word.

### Consonants

Swedish consonants include:

| Letter | Sound | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| b | [b] | **bil** [biːl] (car) |
| c | [s] or [k] | **cykel** [ˈsʏːkəl] (bicycle), **clown** [klaʊn] (clown) |
| d | [d] | **dag** [dɑːɡ] (day) |
| f | [f] | **fisk** [fɪsk] (fish) |
| g | [ɡ] or [j] | **gata** [ˈɡɑːta] (street), **gärna** [ˈjæːɳa] (gladly) |
| h | [h] | **hund** [hɵnd] (dog) |
| j | [j] | **ja** [jɑː] (yes) |
| k | [k] or [ɕ] | **kaka** [ˈkɑːka] (cake), **kära** [ˈɕæːra] (dear) |
| l | [l] | **lång** [lɔŋ] (long) |
| m | [m] | **mor** [muːr] (mother) |
| n | [n] | **natt** [nat] (night) |
| p | [p] | **pappa** [ˈpapːa] (dad) |
| q | [k] | **Qatar** [kaˈtɑːr] (Qatar) |
| r | [r] or [ɾ] | **röd** [røːd] (red) |
| s | [s] | **sol** [suːl] (sun) |
| t | [t] | **tack** [tak] (thanks) |
| v | [v] | **var** [vɑːr] (where) |
| w | [v] | **whisky** [vɪskɪ] (whiskey) |
| x | [ks] | **extra** [ˈɛkstra] (extra) |
| z | [s] | **zoo** [suː] (zoo) |

Notable consonant combinations:
- **sj-** [ɧ]: **sjö** [ɧøː] (lake), **sjunga** [ˈɧɵŋːa] (to sing)
- **sk-** [ɧ] before front vowels: **skägg** [ɧɛɡː] (beard), **skina** [ˈɧiːna] (to shine)
- **tj-** [ɕ]: **tjugo** [ˈɕʉːɡʊ] (twenty), **tjock** [ɕɔkː] (thick)
- **ng** [ŋ]: **ring** [rɪŋː] (ring)
- **rt, rd, rn, rs, rl** are often pronounced as retroflex consonants: [ʈ], [ɖ], [ɳ], [ʂ], [ɭ]

Some consonants undergo assimilation processes:
- **rt** → [ʈ]: **karta** [ˈkɑːʈa] (map)
- **rd** → [ɖ]: **bord** [buːɖ] (table)
- **rn** → [ɳ]: **barn** [bɑːɳ] (child)
- **rs** → [ʂ]: **kors** [kɔʂ] (cross)
- **rl** → [ɭ]: **Karl** [kɑːɭ] (Charles)

### Stress and Pitch Accent

Swedish is a pitch-accent language, meaning that word stress can distinguish between different words or grammatical forms. There are two types of accent:

1. Accent 1 (acute): single-peaked stress
2. Accent 2 (grave): double-peaked stress

Examples:
- **anden** [ˈandən] (the duck) - Accent 1
- **anden** [ˈànden] (the spirit) - Accent 2
- **tomten** [ˈtɔmtən] (the plot of land) - Accent 1
- **tomten** [ˈtɔ̀mtən] (Santa Claus) - Accent 2

The difference is subtle and often challenging for non-native speakers to master. Generally, accent 1 is used for monosyllabic words and some compound words, while accent 2 is used for most polysyllabic words.

Stress in Swedish typically falls on the first syllable of native words:
- **´flicka** (girl)
- **´arbete** (work)

However, many loanwords retain their original stress patterns:
- **stu´dent** (student)
- **tele´fon** (telephone)

## Morphology

Swedish morphology involves various inflectional and derivational processes for nouns, adjectives, verbs, and other parts of speech.

### Nouns

Swedish nouns have two grammatical genders: common (utrum) and neuter (neutrum). They are inflected for number and definiteness.

#### Gender

- Common gender: about 75% of Swedish nouns
  Examples: **en stol** (a chair), **en bil** (a car), **en flicka** (a girl)
- Neuter gender: about 25% of Swedish nouns
  Examples: **ett bord** (a table), **ett hus** (a house), **ett barn** (a child)

There are no strict rules for determining a noun's gender, although there are some patterns:
- Most animate nouns are common gender
- Most abstract nouns are common gender
- Many loanwords are common gender
- Nouns ending in -um are usually neuter (e.g., **centrum** - center)

#### Definiteness

Definiteness is marked by suffixes or separate articles:

| Gender | Indefinite | Definite |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Common | en stol | stol**en** |
| Neuter | ett bord | bord**et** |

Examples:
- **en bok** (a book) → **boken** (the book)
- **ett äpple** (an apple) → **äpplet** (the apple)

In some cases, particularly with adjectives, a separate definite article is used:
- **den stora boken** (the big book)
- **det gröna äpplet** (the green apple)

#### Plural

Plural forms vary, but common patterns include:

- -or: **flicka** (girl) → **flickor** (girls)
- -ar: **pojke** (boy) → **pojkar** (boys)
- -er: **tid** (time) → **tider** (times)
- -n: **äpple** (apple) → **äpplen** (apples)
- No change: **hus** (house) → **hus** (houses)

Some nouns have irregular plural forms:
- **man** (man) → **män** (men)
- **mus** (mouse) → **möss** (mice)
- **gås** (goose) → **gäss** (geese)

Definite plural forms:
- Common gender: add -na or -a
  **stolar** (chairs) → **stolarna** (the chairs)
- Neuter gender: add -en or -a
  **hus** (houses) → **husen** (the houses)

#### Genitive

The genitive case is formed by adding -s to the end of a noun:
- **flickans bok** (the girl's book)
- **husets tak** (the roof of the house)
- **böckernas författare** (the books' author)

The genitive -s is added after the definite or plural ending:
- **flickornas böcker** (the girls' books)
- **husens tak** (the roofs of the houses)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Swedish:

| Person | Nominative | Objective | Possessive |
|--------|------------|-----------|------------|
| 1sg | **jag** | **mig** | **min/mitt/mina** |

Past participle:
- Varies by verb group, often ends in -d, -t, or -en
- **talad** (spoken), **läst** (read), **skriven** (written)

- **väl** (well) → **bättre** (better) → **bäst** (best)

## Syntax

Swedish syntax is characterized by its V2 (verb-second) word order in main clauses and the distinction between main and subordinate clause structures.

### Word Order

Swedish generally follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in simple declarative sentences:

**Jag läser en bok.** (I read a book.)

However, Swedish also employs the V2 (verb-second) rule in main clauses, meaning the finite verb must be the second constituent:

**Igår läste jag en bok.** (Yesterday I read a book.)
**Nu ska jag gå hem.** (Now I will go home.)

The V2 rule applies even when the subject is not the first element:

**Den boken har jag läst.** (That book I have read.)

In questions, the verb comes before the subject:

**Läser du en bok?** (Are you reading a book?)
**Vad läser du?** (What are you reading?)

In subordinate clauses, the word order changes:

**Jag vet att han inte läser boken.** (I know that he doesn’t read the book.)

The typical subordinate clause structure is:

Subject - Adverb - Verb - Object

**...att han ofta läser böcker.** (...that he often reads books.)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by inverting the subject and verb:
- Statement: **Du talar svenska.** (You speak Swedish.)
- Question: **Talar du svenska?** (Do you speak Swedish?)

Wh-questions start with a question word, followed by the verb:
- **Vad heter du?** (What is your name?)
- **Var bor du?** (Where do you live?)
- **När kommer du?** (When are you coming?)
- **Hur mår du?** (How are you?)

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed using **inte** (not):
- **Jag talar inte svenska.** (I don’t speak Swedish.)
- **Hon kommer inte idag.** (She is not coming today.)

In subordinate clauses, **inte** comes before the verb:
- **Jag vet att han inte talar svenska.** (I know that he doesn’t speak Swedish.)
- **Om du inte kommer, ring mig.** (If you're not coming, call me.)

### Conjunctions

Coordinating conjunctions:
- **och** (and): **Jag gillar kaffe och te.** (I like coffee and tea.)
- **men** (but): **Jag vill gå ut, men det regnar.** (I want to go out, but it's raining.)
- **eller** (or): **Vill du ha kaffe eller te?** (Do you want coffee or tea?)
- **för** (for, because): **Jag stannar hemma, för jag är sjuk.** (I'm staying home because I'm sick.)

Subordinating conjunctions:
- **att** (that): **Jag tror att det kommer att regna.** (I think that it will rain.)
- **eftersom** (because): **Jag stannar hemma eftersom jag är sjuk.** (I'm staying home because I'm sick.)
- **när** (when): **Ring mig när du kommer hem.** (Call me when you get home.)
- **om** (if): **Om det regnar, stannar jag hemma.** (If it rains, I'll stay home.)
- **därför att** (because): **Jag lär mig svenska därför att jag tycker om språk.** (I'm learning Swedish because I like languages.)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Swedish are introduced by relative pronouns:

- **som** (who, which, that): **Mannen som bor här är min granne.** (The man who lives here is my neighbor.)
- **vilket** (which, for neuter nouns): **Huset, vilket är målat rött, ligger på kullen.** (The house, which is painted red, is on the hill.)
- **vars** (whose): **Kvinnan vars bil är blå heter Anna.** (The woman whose car is blue is named Anna.)

## Vocabulary

Swedish vocabulary has been influenced by various languages throughout history:

1. Old Norse: The foundation of Swedish vocabulary
   Example: **hus** (house), **barn** (child), **kvinna** (woman), **man** (man)

2. Low German: Due to Hanseatic trade influence
   Example: **fönster** (window), **arbete** (work), **språk** (language), **handel** (trade)

3. French: Especially in areas of culture and cuisine
   Example: **paraply** (umbrella), **restaurang** (restaurant), **garderob** (wardrobe), **parfym** (perfume)

4. English: Particularly in modern technology and pop culture
   Example: **mejl** (email), **chatta** (to chat), **smartphone** (smartphone), **DJ** (DJ)

### Compound Words

Swedish readily forms compound words, often creating long, descriptive terms:
- **järnvägsstationen** (the railway station): **järnväg** (railway) + **station** (station)
- **barnsjukhus** (children's hospital): **barn** (child) + **sjukhus** (hospital)
- **fredagseftermiddag** (Friday afternoon): **fredag** (Friday) + **eftermiddag** (afternoon)
- **världsmästerskapet** (the world championship): **värld** (world) + **mästerskap** (championship)

### False Friends with English

Some Swedish words look similar to English words but have different meanings:
- **gift** means “married” or “poison” in Swedish (not “gift”)
- **bra** means “good” in Swedish (not “bra”)
- **rolig** means “fun” in Swedish (not “rolling”)
- **semester** means “vacation” in Swedish (not “semester”)
- **glass** means “ice cream” in Swedish (not “glass”)

### Loanwords

Swedish has adopted many loanwords from other languages, often adapting them to Swedish spelling and pronunciation:
- **sjal** (shawl, from Persian)
- **bagare** (baker, from German)
- **telefon** (telephone, from Greek)
- **garage** (garage, from French)
- **chips** (chips, from English)

## Colloquial Swedish

Spoken Swedish often differs from the written language:

1. Pronunciation shortcuts:
   - **jag** [jɑː] instead of [jɑːɡ]
   - **det är** often pronounced as **de e** [deː]
   - **är du** often contracted to **äru** [æɾʉ]

2. Informal pronouns:
   - **dom** used for both **de** (they) and **dem** (them)
   - **nån** instead of **någon** (someone)
   - **nåt** instead of **något** (something)

3. Slang and informal expressions:
   - **kul** (fun) instead of **rolig**
   - **snacka** (to talk) instead of **prata**
   - **jobba** (to work) instead of **arbeta**
   - **kompis** (friend) instead of **vän**

4. Particle verbs:
   - **äta upp** (to eat up)
   - **gå ut** (to go out)
   - **komma ihåg** (to remember)
   - **tycka om** (to like)

5. Colloquial interjections:
   - **Oj!** (Oh!)
   - **Usch!** (Yuck!)
   - **Fy!** (Shame!)
   - **Hoppsan!** (Oops!)

## Dialects

Swedish has a wide variety of dialects, broadly categorized into six groups:

1. Norrland dialects: Spoken in northern Sweden
   Characteristics: Preservation of older vowel sounds, distinct intonation

2. Finland Swedish: Spoken by the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland
   Characteristics: Influenced by Finnish, different rhythm and intonation

3. Svealand dialects: Spoken in central Sweden, including Stockholm
   Characteristics: Often considered “standard Swedish”

4. Gotland dialects: Spoken on the island of Gotland
   Characteristics: Unique vocabulary, retained some Old Norse features

5. Götaland dialects: Spoken in southern Sweden
   Characteristics: Varied pronunciation, some Danish influence in the south

6. South Swedish dialects: Spoken in Skåne (Scania)
   Characteristics: Strong Danish influence, different pronunciation of 'r'

Notable differences can be found in pronunciation, vocabulary, and even grammar between these dialect groups. For example:
- The word “I” (jag) can be pronounced as [jɑː] (Stockholm), [jɑːɡ] (formal), [jɔ] (Gothenburg), or [ja] (Skåne)
- The phrase “Jag heter” (My name is) might be “Ja heter” in Svealand or “Jag heder” in parts of Norrland

## Writing System

Swedish uses the Latin alphabet with the addition of three letters: Å/å, Ä/ä, and Ö/ö.

The alphabet order is:
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Å Ä Ö

Some spelling rules:
- **ck** is used instead of **kk**: **tacka** (to thank)
- **x** is pronounced [ks]: **taxi** [taksi]
- **c** is usually pronounced [s] before front vowels (e, i, y, ä, ö) and [k] before back vowels (a, o, u, å)
- **j** is always pronounced [j], even before front vowels: **jeans** [jeːns]
- **kj-** is pronounced [ɕ]: **kjol** [ɕuːl] (skirt)

Capitalization rules:
- Sentence beginnings and proper nouns are capitalized
- Days of the week, months, and languages are not capitalized: **måndag** (Monday), **januari** (January), **svenska** (Swedish)

Punctuation is similar to English, with some differences:
- Quotation marks: “citattecken” or »citattecken«
- Question mark and exclamation mark are used as in English
- Colon is used before direct speech: Han sa: “Hej!”
