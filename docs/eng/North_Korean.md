# North Korean Language

The North Korean language, officially called “Cultural Language” (문화어, munhwaeo), is a variety of the Korean language spoken in North Korea. While largely mutually intelligible with South Korean, it has developed distinct features due to decades of separation and different language policies.

## Phonology

The phonology of North Korean is similar to that of Standard Korean, with some notable differences.

### Vowels

North Korean retains some vowel distinctions that have merged in South Korean:

| North Korean | South Korean | IPA | Example |
|--------------|--------------|-----|---------|
| ㅚ | ㅚ/ㅞ | [ø] | **외국** [øːguk] “foreign country” |
| ㅟ | ㅟ/ㅞ | [y] | **귀** [ky] “ear” |

### Consonants

Some consonantal differences include:

1. Preservation of initial [ɾ]:
   - North: **로동** [ɾodoŋ] “labor”
   - South: **노동** [nodoŋ] “labor”

2. Less frequent tensification:
   - North: **같이** [kati] “together”
   - South: **같이** [kat͈i] “together”

3. Retention of [w] before [i] and [e]:
   - North: **외국** [øːguk] or [weguk] “foreign country”
   - South: **외국** [øːguk] or [weguk] “foreign country”

### Phonological processes

1. Vowel harmony: Unlike South Korean, North Korean maintains a stricter vowel harmony system in native words:
   - **아름답다** [aɾɯmdapda] “beautiful” (all yang vowels)
   - **어린이** [əɾini] “child” (all yin vowels)

2. Assimilation: Similar to South Korean, but with some differences:
   - **십리** [simni] “ten ri (unit of distance)” (labial assimilation)
   - **백리** [pæŋni] “hundred ri” (velar assimilation)

## Orthography

North Korean orthography generally follows the same principles as South Korean, with some differences:

1. Use of arae-a (ㆍ): This obsolete vowel is sometimes used in North Korean texts for historical or ideological reasons:
   - **나라** (South) vs. **나ᆞ라** (North) “country”

2. Spelling of loanwords: North Korean tends to use more native-like spellings for loanwords:
   - **뻐스** (North) vs. **버스** (South) “bus”
   - **와샤** (North) vs. **워셔** (South) “washer”

3. Spacing: North Korean tends to write compound words without spaces:

## Morphology

### Nouns

North Korean nouns follow similar patterns to South Korean, with some differences in usage and vocabulary:

   - **우리** “we” (also used as a first-person singular pronoun)

2. Second-person pronouns:
   - **당신** is used more frequently in North Korea, without the negative connotation it can have in South Korea

### Word Order

The basic word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), same as in South Korean:

“Comrade Kim reads a book”

However, North Korean tends to place adverbs and modifiers before the words they modify more strictly than South Korean:

- North: **아주 빨간 꽃** “very red flower”

### Sentence-Ending Particles

“He said that he was a student”

## Vocabulary

2. Polite form: Used in most everyday situations
   **저는 학생입니다** “I am a student”

3. Honorific form: Used when referring to leaders or in very formal situations

### Gender in Language

North Korean language policy has promoted gender-neutral language:

- Use of **동무** “comrade” as a gender-neutral term of address

## Dialectal Variation

While North Korea promotes a standard language (문화어 munhwaeo), some regional variations persist:

1. Pyongan dialect:
   - Influence on standard North Korean pronunciation
   - Example: pronunciation of ㅅ as [s] before [i] and [j], where South Korean uses [ɕ]

3. Standardization:
   - Establishment of 문화어 (munhwaeo) as the standard language
   - Based on Pyongyang speech with some influences from northern dialects
