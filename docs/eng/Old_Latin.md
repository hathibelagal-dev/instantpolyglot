# Old Latin

Old Latin, also known as Early Latin or Archaic Latin, refers to the Latin language as it existed from its earliest known forms until approximately 75 BCE. This period spans from the earliest Latin inscriptions (around the 7th century BCE) to just before the time of Cicero and Caesar. Old Latin is distinct from Classical Latin in its grammar, vocabulary, and orthography.

## Historical Context

Old Latin developed from Proto-Italic, a branch of the Indo-European language family. It was spoken in the region of Latium, centered around Rome, and gradually spread throughout the Italian peninsula as Roman influence grew.

The Old Latin period can be roughly divided into three sub-periods:

1. Very Old Latin (7th-5th centuries BCE): Represented by the earliest inscriptions.
2. Early Old Latin (5th-3rd centuries BCE): A period of significant linguistic development.
3. Late Old Latin (3rd-1st centuries BCE): The transition period leading to Classical Latin.

During this time, Latin was influenced by other Italic languages such as Oscan and Umbrian, as well as Etruscan and Greek.

## Phonology

The phonology of Old Latin differed significantly from Classical Latin, with several sound changes occurring during the transition period.

### Vowels

Old Latin had a system of short and long vowels:

| Short | Long |
|-------|------|
| a [a] | ā [aː] |
| e [e] | ē [eː] |
| i [ɪ] | ī [iː] |
| o [ɔ] | ō [oː] |
| u [ʊ] | ū [uː] |

Additionally, Old Latin had diphthongs:

| Diphthong | Pronunciation | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| ai [ai̯]  | Later became ae [ae̯] | **aidilis** → **aedilis** (“aedile”) |
| ei [ei̯]  | Later monophthongized to ī [iː] | **deicere** → **dīcere** (“to say”) |
| oi [oi̯]  | Later became oe [oe̯] | **oinos** → **ūnus** (“one”) |
| ou [ou̯]  | Later monophthongized to ū [uː] | **douco** → **dūcō** (“I lead”) |
| au [au̯]  | Remained in Classical Latin | **aurum** (“gold”) |
| eu [eu̯]  | Rare, mostly in interjections | **heu** (“alas!”) |

### Consonants

The consonant system of Old Latin was similar to that of Classical Latin, with a few notable differences:

| Consonant | Pronunciation | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| c | [k] | Always pronounced as [k], even before front vowels |
| g | [ɡ] | Introduced later to distinguish from c |
| qu | [kʷ] | |
| r | [r] | Trilled |
| s | [s] | Always voiceless |
| x | [ks] | |
| z | [dz] | Rare, only in loanwords |
| f | [f] | Could appear word-finally, unlike in Classical Latin |
| h | [h] | More consistently pronounced than in Classical Latin |

Notable consonant features:

1. Lack of distinction between [k] and [g]: Before the introduction of the letter G, C represented both sounds. For example, **VIRCO** could mean either **virgo** (“maiden”) or **Virgo** (the constellation).

2. Word-final [d]: Many words retained a final -d that was later lost in Classical Latin. For example, ablative **marid** became **marī** (“by sea”).

3. Preservation of [w] sound: The sound [w], written as V, was preserved in all positions. In Classical Latin, it became [v] in some positions.

4. Aspirated consonants: Greek loanwords with aspirated consonants (φ, θ, χ) were often rendered without aspiration in Old Latin, e.g., **purpura** for Greek πορφύρα (porphyra, “purple”).

### Stress

The stress pattern in Old Latin differed from Classical Latin. In Old Latin, stress fell on the first syllable of every word, regardless of its length. This is known as the “initial stress rule.” For example:

- **fácilis** (“easy”) [ˈfakɪlɪs]
- **fácilius** (“more easily”) [ˈfakɪlɪʊs]
- **témpestatibus** (“by the seasons”) [ˈtempestatiβʊs]

This stress pattern later evolved into the “penultimate rule” of Classical Latin, where stress fell on the second-to-last syllable if it was heavy (long by nature or position) or on the third-to-last syllable if the penultimate was light.

### Phonological Changes

Several significant sound changes occurred during the transition from Old Latin to Classical Latin:

1. Vowel weakening in medial syllables:
   Unstressed vowels in medial syllables often weakened or syncopated.
   **faciō** (“I make”) → **cōnficiō** (“I complete”)
   **reficiō** (“I rebuild”) from **re-** + **faciō**

2. Monophthongization of diphthongs:
   **oi** → **ū** or **oe**: **oinos** → **ūnus** (“one”), **poena** (from Greek ποινή) retained
   **ei** → **ī**: **deicō** → **dīcō** (“I say”)
   **ou** → **ū**: **douco** → **dūcō** (“I lead”)

3. Rhotacism: intervocalic **s** → **r**
   **esam** → **eram** (“I was”)
   **genesis** → **generis** (genitive of **genus**, “kind, type”)

4. Loss of final consonants:
   Final **-d** in ablative singular: **patre(d)** → **patre** (“by/with the father”)
   Final **-m** in some forms: **sibei** → **sibi** (“to himself”)

5. Assimilation of consonant clusters:
   **adferō** → **afferō** (“I bring to”)
   **subponō** → **suppōnō** (“I place under”)

6. Palatalization: [k] and [g] before front vowels began to palatalize, leading to their eventual pronunciation as [t͡ʃ] and [d͡ʒ] in Late Latin and Romance languages.

## Orthography

Old Latin orthography was not standardized and varied considerably over time and between regions. Some notable features include:

1. Use of ⟨c⟩ for both [k] and [ɡ] sounds before the introduction of ⟨g⟩.
2. Lack of distinction between long and short vowels in writing.
3. Use of ⟨ei⟩ for both [ei̯] and [iː].
4. Inconsistent use of double consonants to indicate gemination.
5. Use of ⟨xs⟩ instead of ⟨x⟩ in some inscriptions.
6. Occasional use of ⟨z⟩ in early inscriptions, later replaced by ⟨s⟩ and reintroduced for Greek loanwords.
7. Use of ⟨qu⟩ where Classical Latin used ⟨c⟩ before ⟨o⟩ and ⟨u⟩: **pequnia** → **pecūnia** (“money”)

Examples of Old Latin spellings:

- **DVENOS** for later **bonus** (“good”)
- **AIDILES** for later **aediles** (“aediles”, a type of Roman magistrate)
- **DEIVOS** for later **deus** (“god”)
- **VHEVHAKED** for later **fēcit** (“he/she made”)
- **FEELIX** for later **fēlix** (“happy, fortunate”)
- **PVCNANDOD** for later **pugnandō** (“by fighting”)

The development of Latin orthography was gradual, with many changes occurring during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE. The alphabet was standardized to 23 letters by the 1st century BCE:

A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X Y Z

Note the absence of J, U, and W, which were later additions to represent distinct sounds in medieval and modern Latin.

## Morphology

Old Latin morphology was more complex than Classical Latin in some aspects, retaining features that were later simplified or lost.

### Nouns

Old Latin nouns had the same cases as Classical Latin: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative. However, there were some differences in declension patterns.

#### First Declension

The first declension in Old Latin ended in -ā (later -a in Classical Latin). Some forms retained -ās in the nominative singular.

Example: **mensa** (“table”)

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **mensā** | **mensai** |
| Accusative | **mensam** | **mensās** |
| Genitive | **mensās** | **mensārum** |
| Dative | **mensai** | **mensāis** |
| Ablative | **mensād** | **mensāis** |

Note the dative singular ending -ai and the nominative plural -ai, which later became -ae in Classical Latin.

#### Second Declension

The second declension in Old Latin had some notable differences from Classical Latin.

Example: **servos** (“slave”, later **servus**)

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **servos** | **servoi** |
| Accusative | **servom** | **servōs** |
| Genitive | **servī** | **servōrom** |
| Dative | **servō** | **servois** |
| Ablative | **servōd** | **servois** |

Note the nominative singular ending -os and the nominative plural -oi, which later became -us and -i respectively in Classical Latin.

Neuter nouns of the second declension had their own peculiarities:

Example: **donom** (“gift”, later **donum**)

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **donom** | **donā** |
| Accusative | **donom** | **donā** |
| Genitive | **donī** | **donōrom** |
| Dative | **donō** | **donois** |
| Ablative | **donōd** | **donois** |

#### Third Declension

The third declension in Old Latin was similar to Classical Latin, but with some archaic endings.

Example: **rēx** (“king”)

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **rēx** | **rēgēs** |
| Accusative | **rēgem** | **rēgēs** |
| Genitive | **rēgis** | **rēgom** |
| Dative | **rēgei** | **rēgibus** |
| Ablative | **rēged** | **rēgibus** |

Note the genitive plural ending -om, which later became -um in Classical Latin.

#### Fourth and Fifth Declensions

The fourth and fifth declensions were less distinct in Old Latin and were still developing from the consonant stems of the third declension.

Example of early fourth declension: **senātus** (“senate”)

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **senātus** | **senātūs** |
| Accusative | **senātum** | **senātūs** |
| Genitive | **senātuis** | **senātuom** |
| Dative | **senātuī** | **senātibus** |
| Ablative | **senātūd** | **senātibus** |

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Old Latin followed similar patterns to nouns, with some archaic endings.

Example: **bonus** (“good”)

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **bonos** | **bonā** | **bonom** |
| Accusative | **bonom** | **bonām** | **bonom** |
| Genitive | **bonī** | **bonās** | **bonī** |
| Dative | **bonō** | **bonai** | **bonō** |
| Ablative | **bonōd** | **bonād** | **bonōd** |

Comparative and superlative forms were similar to Classical Latin, but with some differences:

- Comparative: **-ios**, **-ior** (nom. sg. masc./fem.), **-ios** (nom./acc. sg. neut.)
- Superlative: **-issumos**, **-issuma**, **-issumom**

Example:
- Positive: **altus** (“high”)
- Comparative: **altior** (masc./fem.), **altios** (neut.)
- Superlative: **altissumos** (masc.), **altissuma** (fem.), **altissumom** (neut.)

### Pronouns

Pronouns in Old Latin had some forms that differed from Classical Latin.

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive | Dative |
|--------|------------|------------|----------|--------|
| 1st sg. | **egō** | **mēd** | **mis** | **mihei** |
| 2nd sg. | **tū** | **tēd** | **tis** | **tibei** |
| 3rd sg. masc. | **is** | **im** | **eis** | **eiei** |
| 3rd sg. fem. | **ea** | **eam** | **eās** | **eai** |
| 1st pl. | **nōs** | **nōs** | **nostrom** | **nōbeis** |
| 2nd pl. | **vōs** | **vōs** | **vostrom** | **vōbeis** |

Note the accusative forms **mēd** and **tēd**, which later lost the final -d in Classical Latin.

Demonstrative pronouns also had some distinct forms:

- **hic** (“this”) had forms like **hoic** (dative singular) and **hāsce** (accusative plural feminine)
- **iste** (“that of yours”) was **iste** (nom. sg. masc.), **ista** (nom. sg. fem.), **istud** (nom. sg. neut.)
- **ille** (“that”) was **olle** in earlier Old Latin, with forms like **ollus**, **olla**, **ollum**

Relative pronoun:

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **quoi** | **quai** | **quod** |
| Accusative | **quom** | **quam** | **quod** |
| Genitive | **quoius** | **quoius** | **quoius** |
| Dative | **quoi** | **quoi** | **quoi** |
| Ablative | **quōd** | **quād** | **quōd** |

### Verbs

Old Latin verbs retained some archaic features that were later lost or changed in Classical Latin.

#### Present Tense

Example: **amō** (“I love”)

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **amō** | **amāmos** |
| 2nd | **amās** | **amātis** |
| 3rd | **amat** | **amant** |

Note the 1st person plural ending -mos, which later became -mus in Classical Latin.

#### Perfect Tense

The perfect tense in Old Latin often used reduplication, a feature largely lost in Classical Latin.

Examples of reduplicated perfects:
- **tetulī** (from **ferō**, “I carry”) → Classical Latin **tulī**
- **memordi** (from **mordeō**, “I bite”) → Classical Latin **momordī**
- **pepugī** (from **pungō**, “I prick”) → Classical Latin **pupugī**
- **fefelli** (from **fallō**, “I deceive”) → retained in Classical Latin
- **cecini** (from **canō**, “I sing”) → retained in Classical Latin

Some verbs showed vowel alternation in the perfect:
- **agō** (“I do”) → perfect **ēgī**
- **capiō** (“I take”) → perfect **cēpī**

#### Future Tense

Old Latin had distinct future tense formations:

1. For the first and second conjugations, using the suffix -bo:
   - **amābō** (“I will love”)
   - **monēbō** (“I will advise”)

2. For the third and fourth conjugations, using the suffix -am:
   - **regam** (“I will rule”)
   - **audiam** (“I will hear”)

These forms were largely retained in Classical Latin.

#### Subjunctive Mood

The present subjunctive in Old Latin often used the suffix -ā- for the first conjugation and -ē- for the others:

- **amēm** (“may I love”)
- **moneām** (“may I advise”)
- **regam** (“may I rule”)
- **audiam** (“may I hear”)

The imperfect subjunctive was formed with -sē-:
- **amāsem** (“I would love”) → Classical Latin **amārem**
- **vidēsem** (“I would see”) → Classical Latin **vidērem**

#### Passive Voice

The passive voice in Old Latin used the suffix -r in the present tense:

- **amor** (“I am loved”)
- **amāris** (“you are loved”)
- **amātur** (“he/she/it is loved”)

This form was retained in Classical Latin.

#### Deponent Verbs

Deponent verbs, which have passive forms but active meanings, existed in Old Latin as they did in Classical Latin:

- **sequor** (“I follow”)
- **loquor** (“I speak”)

#### Infinitives

Old Latin infinitives had some distinct forms:

- Active present: **-se** → Classical Latin **-re**
  Example: **esse** (“to be”) remained, but **amāse** became **amāre** (“to love”)
  
- Passive present: **-ier** alongside **-ī**
  Example: **amārier** or **amārī** (“to be loved”)

#### Participles

Participles in Old Latin were similar to those in Classical Latin:

- Present active: **-ns, -ntis**
  Example: **amāns** (“loving”)
  
- Perfect passive: **-tos, -ta, -tom**
  Example: **amātos** (“having been loved”)

- Future active: **-tūros, -tūra, -tūrom**
  Example: **amātūros** (“about to love”)

#### Supine

The supine existed in Old Latin as in Classical Latin:

- **amātum** (“to love”, purpose)
- **amātū** (“to love”, ablative of specification)

### Numerals

Old Latin numerals showed some differences from Classical Latin:

- **oinos** → **ūnus** (“one”)
- **duō** (unchanged, “two”)
- **trēs** (unchanged, “three”)
- **quattuor** (unchanged, “four”)
- **quinque** (unchanged, “five”)
- **sex** (unchanged, “six”)
- **septem** (unchanged, “seven”)
- **octō** (unchanged, “eight”)
- **novem** (unchanged, “nine”)
- **decem** (unchanged, “ten”)

Higher numerals:
- **vīgintī** (“twenty”)
- **centum** (“hundred”)
- **mīlle** (“thousand”)

Ordinal numbers were similar to Classical Latin but with some archaic spellings:
- **prīmos** → **prīmus** (“first”)
- **secundos** → **secundus** (“second”)
- **tertios** → **tertius** (“third”)

## Syntax

Old Latin syntax was similar to Classical Latin in many respects, but with some notable differences.

### Word Order

Old Latin had a more flexible word order than Classical Latin, with a tendency towards SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) order in main clauses. However, other orders were possible for emphasis or stylistic reasons.

Example:
**Hostēs urbem capiunt.** (“The enemies capture the city.”)

In poetry and more elaborate prose, word order could be highly variable for stylistic effect.

### Subordinate Clauses

Subordinate clauses in Old Latin often used the subjunctive mood, similar to Classical Latin. However, some constructions that later required the subjunctive could use the indicative in Old Latin.

Example:
**Quom veniō, gaudeō.** (“When I come, I rejoice.”)
In Classical Latin, this would be: **Cum veniam, gaudeō.**

Indirect questions in Old Latin sometimes used the indicative where Classical Latin would use the subjunctive:
**Dīc mihī quid facis.** → Classical Latin: **Dīc mihī quid faciās.** (“Tell me what you are doing.”)

### Case Usage

Old Latin case usage was generally similar to Classical Latin, but with some differences:

1. The ablative of instrument sometimes used the preposition **sed** (later **cum** in Classical Latin):
   **Sed saxō percussit.** (“He struck with a stone.”)

2. The genitive was sometimes used where Classical Latin would use the ablative:
   **Virtutis causa** (“for the sake of virtue”)

3. The locative case was more widely used in Old Latin, even with common nouns:
   **domī** (“at home”), **rūrī** (“in the country”)

4. The accusative of direction could be used without a preposition:
   **Rōmam eō** (“I go to Rome”) - this usage persisted in Classical Latin for city names

5. The dative of possession was common:
   **Mihi nōmen est** (“The name is to me” = “My name is”)

### Prepositions

Old Latin used fewer prepositions than Classical Latin, often relying on case usage alone to express relationships. Some prepositions had different forms:

- **en** → **in** (“in, into”)
- **ex, ec** → **ex** (“out of”)
- **ap** → **ab** (“from”)

### Conjunctions

Some conjunctions had different forms in Old Latin:

- **quom** → **cum** (“when”)
- **sei** → **sī** (“if”)
- **nei** → **nī** (“unless”)

### Negation

Negation in Old Latin used **ne** more frequently than Classical Latin, which preferred **non**:

**Ne faciam.** → Classical Latin: **Non faciam.** (“I will not do it.”)

Double negatives were used for emphasis rather than cancelling each other out:

**Nēmō ne umquam.** (“No one ever”)

### Comparison

Comparison in Old Latin used some constructions that were less common in Classical Latin:

- Use of ablative for comparison: **Hōc maius** (“greater than this”)
- Use of quam with nominative: **Fortior hic quam ille est** (“This one is braver than that one”)
