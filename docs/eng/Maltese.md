# Maltese

Maltese is a Semitic language spoken by approximately 520,000 people, primarily in Malta. It is the national language of Malta and an official language of the European Union. Maltese is unique among Semitic languages as it is written in the Latin alphabet and has been heavily influenced by Romance languages, particularly Sicilian and Italian, as well as English.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Maltese uses a modified Latin alphabet consisting of 30 letters. The pronunciation is generally regular, with some exceptions.

### Vowels

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
**a** | [ɐ] or [a]
**e** | [ɛ] or [e]
**i** | [ɪ] or [i]
**o** | [ɔ] or [o]
**u** | [ʊ] or [u]
**ie** | [ɪː] or [iː]

The exact pronunciation of vowels can vary depending on stress and surrounding consonants.

### Consonants

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
**b** | [b]
**ċ** | [tʃ]
**d** | [d]
**f** | [f]
**ġ** | [dʒ]
**g** | [ɡ]
**għ** | silent or lengthens adjacent vowels
**h** | silent or [h]
**ħ** | [ħ]
**j** | [j]
**k** | [k]
**l** | [l]
**m** | [m]
**n** | [n]
**p** | [p]
**q** | [ʔ]
**r** | [r]
**s** | [s]
**t** | [t]
**v** | [v]
**w** | [w]
**x** | [ʃ]
**z** | [z]
**ż** | [ts]

### Stress

Stress in Maltese words is generally on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable. However, there are exceptions, particularly in words of Semitic origin or those with certain suffixes.

Examples:
- **kelma** ('word') [ˈkɛlmɐ]
- **tifhimni** ('you understand me') [tɪfˈhɪmnɪ]
- **televisjoni** ('television') [tɛlɛvɪzˈjɔnɪ]

### Digraphs and special characters

Maltese has several digraphs and special characters:

1. **għ**: This silent letter often lengthens adjacent vowels or indicates where a sound was historically pronounced. Example: **għasfur** ('bird') [aːsfʊr]

2. **ie**: Represents a long 'i' sound. Example: **siegħa** ('hour') [siːħɐ]

3. **ċ**, **ġ**, **ħ**, **ż**: These characters represent distinct sounds and are considered separate letters in the Maltese alphabet.

## Morphology

### Nouns

Maltese nouns have two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural). The definite article in Maltese is **il-**, which changes form based on the initial sound of the following word.

Examples:
- **il-ktieb** ('the book')
- **l-omm** ('the mother')
- **ir-raġel** ('the man')

#### Plural formation

Maltese has several ways to form plurals:

1. Internal vowel change (broken plurals):
   - **ktieb** ('book') → **kotba** ('books')
   - **kelb** ('dog') → **klieb** ('dogs')

2. Suffix addition:
   - **siġġu** ('chair') → **siġġijiet** ('chairs')
   - **ħabib** ('friend') → **ħbieb** ('friends')

3. Irregular plurals:
   - **mara** ('woman') → **nisa** ('women')
   - **id** ('hand') → **idejn** ('hands')

#### Construct state

Maltese retains the Semitic construct state, where two nouns are combined to show possession or association:

- **dar** ('house') + **raġel** ('man') → **dar ir-raġel** ('the man's house')
- **bieb** ('door') + **kamra** ('room') → **bieb il-kamra** ('the door of the room')

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Maltese generally follow the noun they modify and agree in gender and number:

- **karozza ħamra** ('red car', feminine singular)
- **karozzi ħomor** ('red cars', feminine plural)
- **raġel twil** ('tall man', masculine singular)
- **irġiel twal** ('tall men', masculine plural)

Some adjectives have irregular forms:
- **kbir** ('big', masc.) → **kbira** (fem.) → **kbar** (plural)
- **ġdid** ('new', masc.) → **ġdida** (fem.) → **ġodda** (plural)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Maltese:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
1st | **jien** / **jiena** | **aħna**
2nd | **int** / **inti** | **intom**
3rd masc. | **hu** / **huwa** | **huma**
3rd fem. | **hi** / **hija** | **huma**

Possessive pronouns are suffixed to nouns:

- **ktieb** ('book') → **ktieb-i** ('my book')
- **dar** ('house') → **dar-ek** ('your house')
- **kelb** ('dog') → **kelb-u** ('his dog')
- **omm** ('mother') → **omm-ha** ('her mother')
- **ħbieb** ('friends') → **ħbieb-na** ('our friends')
- **karozza** ('car') → **karozz-t-kom** ('your car', plural)
- **ulied** ('children') → **ulied-hom** ('their children')

Object pronouns are suffixed to verbs:

- **ra** ('he saw') → **ra-ni** ('he saw me')
- **taf** ('you know') → **taf-u** ('you know him')
- **bgħat** ('send') → **bgħat-li-l-na** ('send it to us')

### Verbs

Maltese verbs are based on a root system, typically consisting of three consonants. Different patterns of vowels and affixes are applied to these roots to create different tenses, aspects, and derived forms.

#### Present tense

The present tense is formed by adding prefixes and suffixes to the verb root. For regular verbs, the pattern is generally:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
1st | **n-** | **n-u**
2nd | **t-** | **t-u**
3rd masc. | **j-** | **j-u**
3rd fem. | **t-** | **j-u**

Example with the verb **kiteb** ('to write'):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
1st | **nikteb** | **niktbu**
2nd | **tikteb** | **tiktbu**
3rd masc. | **jikteb** | **jiktbu**
3rd fem. | **tikteb** | **jiktbu**

#### Past tense

The past tense is formed by changing the vowel pattern within the root and adding suffixes:

Example with **kiteb** ('to write'):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
1st | **ktibt** | **ktibna**
2nd | **ktibt** | **ktibtu**
3rd masc. | **kiteb** | **kitbu**
3rd fem. | **kitbet** | **kitbu**

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed by using the root of the verb:

- **ikteb** ('write!', singular)
- **iktbu** ('write!', plural)

#### Participles

Maltese has active and passive participles:

- Active participle: **miexi** ('walking')
- Passive participle: **miktub** ('written')

#### Verb forms

Maltese verbs have ten forms, similar to Arabic, although not all forms are used for every root:

1. Form I: The basic form (e.g., **kiteb** 'to write')
2. Form II: Intensive or causative (e.g., **kisser** 'to break into pieces')
3. Form III: Conative (e.g., **qiegħed** 'to place')
4. Form IV: Causative (e.g., **waqqa'** 'to drop')
5. Form V: Reflexive of Form II (e.g., **tkisser** 'to be broken into pieces')
6. Form VI: Reciprocal (e.g., **tqatel** 'to fight each other')
7. Form VII: Passive (e.g., **nkiteb** 'to be written')
8. Form VIII: Reflexive (e.g., **ftaqar** 'to become poor')
9. Form IX: Colors and physical defects (e.g., **ħmar** 'to become red')
10. Form X: Estimative (e.g., **staħba** 'to hide oneself')

### Numbers

Cardinal numbers in Maltese:

1. **wieħed** / **waħda**
2. **tnejn**
3. **tlieta**
4. **erbgħa**
5. **ħamsa**
6. **sitta**
7. **sebgħa**
8. **tmienja**
9. **disgħa**
10. **għaxra**
11. **ħdax**
20. **għoxrin**
100. **mija**
1000. **elf**

Numbers from 11 to 19 are formed by combining the unit with **-il**:
- 12: **tnax**
- 15: **ħmistax**

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding **-u** to the cardinal number for masculine and **-a** for feminine:
- **l-ewwel** ('first', both genders)
- **it-tieni** ('second', both genders)
- **it-tielet** ('third', both genders)
- **ir-raba'** ('fourth', both genders)
- **il-ħames** ('fifth', both genders)
- **is-sitt** ('sixth', both genders)
- **is-seba'** ('seventh', both genders)
- **it-tmien** ('eighth', both genders)
- **id-disa'** ('ninth', both genders)
- **l-għaxar** ('tenth', both genders)
- **il-ħdax-il** ('eleventh')
- **it-tnax-il** ('twelfth')

## Syntax

Maltese generally follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, but other orders are possible for emphasis or in specific constructions.

### Basic sentence structure

A simple Maltese sentence:

**It-tifel qed jiekol it-tuffieħa.** ('The boy is eating the apple.')

- **It-tifel** - The boy (subject)
- **qed jiekol** - is eating (verb phrase)
- **it-tuffieħa** - the apple (object)

### Questions

Yes/no questions can be formed by adding the question particle **jekk** at the beginning of a statement or by using intonation:

- **Jekk trid tikol?** ('Do you want to eat?')
- **Trid tikol?** ('You want to eat?' / 'Do you want to eat?')

Wh-questions use interrogative words:

- **X'inhu ismek?** ('What is your name?')
- **Fejn toqgħod?** ('Where do you live?')
- **Meta se tiġi?** ('When will you come?')

### Negation

Negation is formed by using **ma** before the verb and **-x** after it:

- **Ma nafx.** ('I don't know.')
- **It-tifel ma jiekol-x it-tuffieħa.** ('The boy doesn't eat the apple.')

For nouns and adjectives, **mhux** is used:

- **Dan mhux ktieb.** ('This is not a book.')
- **Hu mhux kbir.** ('He is not big.')

### Possession

Possession can be expressed in several ways:

1. Using the construct state:
   **il-ktieb tat-tifel** ('the boy's book')

2. Using the possessive pronouns:
   **il-ktieb tiegħi** ('my book')

3. Using **ta'**:
   **il-ktieb ta' Marija** ('Maria's book')

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by **li**:

**Ir-raġel li qed jitkellem huwa l-għalliem tiegħi.** ('The man who is speaking is my teacher.')

### Conditional sentences

Conditional sentences in Maltese use **jekk** ('if'):

**Jekk tagħmel ix-xita, nibqa' d-dar.** ('If it rains, I'll stay at home.')

### Comparative and superlative

Comparatives are formed using **aktar** ('more') or **inqas** ('less'):

- **Dan il-ktieb huwa aktar interessanti.** ('This book is more interesting.')
- **Dak ir-raġel huwa inqas għoli.** ('That man is less tall.')

Superlatives use **l-aktar** or **l-inqas**:

- **Dan huwa l-aktar ktieb interessanti.** ('This is the most interesting book.')
- **Dak huwa l-inqas raġel għoli.** ('That is the least tall man.')

## Vocabulary

Maltese vocabulary is a unique blend of Arabic, Sicilian, Italian, and English influences:

1. Arabic-origin words (often for basic concepts):
   - **kelb** ('dog')
   - **qalb** ('heart')
   - **xemx** ('sun')

2. Sicilian/Italian-origin words:
   - **ċavetta** ('key')
   - **flokk** ('shirt')
   - **tazza** ('glass')

3. English loanwords (especially for modern concepts):
   - **kompjuter** ('computer')
   - **futbol** ('football')
   - **brejk** ('brake')

Many words have synonyms from different origins:

- **sodda** (Arabic origin) and **lett** (Italian origin) both mean 'bed'
- **bieb** (Arabic origin) and **porta** (Italian origin) both mean 'door'

### Common phrases

- **Bonġu** - Good morning
- **Saħħa** - Hello/Goodbye/Cheers
- **Grazzi** - Thank you
- **Jekk jogħġbok** - Please
- **Skużi** - Excuse me
- **Iva** - Yes
- **Le** - No

## Colloquial Maltese

Colloquial Maltese can differ significantly from the standard written form. Some features of colloquial Maltese include:

1. Vowel reduction:
   **ħobż** ('bread') is often pronounced as [ħobs]

2. Consonant assimilation:
   **int min?** ('who are you?') is often pronounced as [ɪmmɪn]

3. Shortening of words:
   **mela** ('so') is often shortened to **'la**

4. Use of Italian/English words instead of Arabic-origin ones:
   **ċans** (chance) instead of **opportunità**

5. Unique idiomatic expressions:
   **Mur ġib** (literally 'go bring') used as an exclamation of disbelief

6. Code-switching with English:
   **Jien se mmur to the shop** ('I'm going to the shop')

7. Use of discourse markers:
   - **imma** ('but') used frequently as a filler word
   - **jiġifieri** ('that is') used for clarification or emphasis

8. Dropping of final vowels:
   **ħadd** instead of **ħadd-a** ('nobody')

9. Use of diminutives:
   **ġuvnott** ('young man') → **ġuvnottello** ('little young man')

10. Emphatic repetition:
    **issa issa** ('right now') for stronger emphasis

11. Maltese-English hybrid words:
    **ipparkjajt** ('I parked') - combining English 'park' with Maltese verb conjugation

### Regional variations

While Malta is a small country, there are some regional variations in pronunciation and vocabulary:

1. Gozitan dialect:
   - Pronunciation of 'q' as [k] instead of [ʔ]
   - Use of **fiex** instead of **f'xiex** ('in what')

2. Cottonera dialect:
   - Tendency to drop final syllables: **tgħid** becomes **tgħi** ('you say')

3. Żejtun dialect:
   - Pronouncing 'ie' as [ɛː] instead of [ɪː]

## Phonology

### Consonant inventory

Maltese has a rich consonant inventory, including some sounds borrowed from Italian and English:

| Manner | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Pharyngeal | Glottal |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|---------|-------|------------|---------|
Plosive | p b | t d | | | k g | | ʔ
Nasal | m | | n | | | |
Trill | | | r | | | |
Fricative | f v | | s z | ʃ ʒ | | ħ | h
Affricate | | | ts dz | tʃ dʒ | | |
Approximant | w | | l | j | | |

### Vowel inventory

Maltese has a five-vowel system, with length distinction:

| | Front | Central | Back |
|------|-------|---------|------|
Close | i iː | | u uː
Mid | ɛ ɛː | | ɔ ɔː
Open | | a aː |

The vowel **ie** [ɪː] is sometimes considered a separate phoneme.

### Phonological processes

1. Vowel harmony: In some words, vowels change to match others in the word:
   **kbir** ('big', masc.) → **kbira** (fem.) but **ċkejken** ('tiny', masc.) → **ċkejkna** (fem.)

2. Assimilation: Consonants often assimilate to neighboring sounds:
   **in-** + **dar** → **id-dar** ('the house')

3. Epenthesis: A vowel is inserted to break up consonant clusters:
   **films** → **filmijiet** ('films')

4. Metathesis: Sometimes sounds switch positions:
   Classical Arabic **qamar** → Maltese **amar** ('moon')

## Writing system

Maltese uses a Latin alphabet with some modifications:

1. The letters **ċ**, **ġ**, **għ**, **ħ**, **ż** are unique to Maltese.

2. The digraph **ie** represents a single vowel sound.

3. The letter **y** is only used in loanwords.

4. Capitalization rules are similar to English, but months, days of the week, and languages are not capitalized:
   **it-Tnejn** ('Monday'), **jannar** ('January'), **ingliż** ('English')

5. Hyphenation is used with attached pronouns and clitics:
   **dar-u** ('his house'), **id-dar** ('the house')

## Loanwords and neologisms

Maltese continues to adopt loanwords, particularly from English:

- **imejl** ('email')
- **mowbajl** ('mobile phone')
- **ċatt** ('chat')

Neologisms are often created for new concepts, sometimes preferring Arabic roots:

- **mutur tas-sħab** ('cloud computing', literally 'cloud engine')
- **aħbarijiet** ('news', from the root ħ-b-r 'to inform')

## Idioms and proverbs

Maltese has a rich collection of idioms and proverbs, often reflecting its maritime culture and historical experiences:

- **Ħareġ mid-dielja u daħal fil-ħarub** ('Out of the frying pan into the fire', literally 'He left the vine and entered the carob tree')
- **Aħjar għasfur f'idek milli mija fl-ajru** ('A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush', literally 'Better a bird in your hand than a hundred in the air')
- **Iz-zokk jintgħaraf mill-friegħi** ('Like father, like son', literally 'The trunk is known by its branches')

## Grammar particularities

### Dual number

While not as prevalent as in Classical Arabic, Maltese retains traces of the dual number for some words:

- **sena** ('year') → **sentejn** ('two years')
- **jum** ('day') → **jumejn** ('two days')

### Elative

Maltese has retained the Arabic elative form for some adjectives, used for the comparative and superlative:

- **kbir** ('big') → **akbar** ('bigger/biggest')
- **ħażin** ('bad') → **agħar** ('worse/worst')

### Verbs of Semitic origin vs Romance origin

Verbs of Semitic origin follow the root-and-pattern system, while those of Romance origin generally follow regular conjugation patterns:

Semitic: **kiteb** ('to write') → **jikteb** ('he writes') → **niktbu** ('we write')
Romance: **ipparkja** ('to park') → **jipparkja** ('he parks') → **nipparkjaw** ('we park')

### Aspectual particles

Maltese uses particles to express aspectual distinctions:

- **qed** for progressive aspect: **Qed nikteb** ('I am writing')
- **se/sa** for immediate future: **Se nikteb** ('I am going to write')
- **kien** for past habitual: **Kien jikteb** ('He used to write')

### Object pronouns

Object pronouns can be attached to verbs, prepositions, or stand alone:

- **Rajt-u** ('I saw him')
- **għalih** ('for him')
- **lilu** ('him', standalone)

### Verbal nouns

Maltese uses verbal nouns (similar to gerunds) in many constructions:

- **It-tfal jħobbu l-għawm** ('The children love swimming', literally 'the swimming')
