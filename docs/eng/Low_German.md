# Low German (Plattdeutsch)

Low German, also known as Low Saxon or Plattdeutsch, is a West Germanic language spoken primarily in northern Germany and eastern Netherlands. It is closely related to Dutch, Frisian, and English, and more distantly to High German. Despite its name, Low German is not a dialect of Standard German but a separate language with its own rich history and linguistic features.

## History and Classification

Low German descends from Old Saxon, which was spoken in northern Germany and the Netherlands from around 500 to 1100 CE. The term “Low” refers to the flat lowlands where the language originated, in contrast to the more mountainous areas where High German developed.

Historically, Low German was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League, a powerful medieval trade alliance. This led to its widespread use across Northern Europe and influenced many languages in the region, including the Scandinavian languages.

The language can be broadly divided into two main groups:

1. West Low German (Westfalisch)
2. East Low German (Ostfalisch)

These groups are further subdivided into numerous local dialects, each with its own unique features and vocabulary.

In the modern era, Low German has faced challenges due to the dominance of Standard German in education and media. However, there are ongoing efforts to preserve and revitalize the language, including its use in literature, theater, and local media.

## Phonology

### Vowels

Low German has a rich vowel system, including both monophthongs and diphthongs. The exact inventory varies between dialects, but a common system includes:

Monophthongs:
- Close vowels: /i:/, /ɪ/, /y:/, /ʏ/, /u:/, /ʊ/
- Mid vowels: /e:/, /ɛ/, /ø:/, /œ/, /o:/, /ɔ/
- Open vowels: /a:/, /a/
- Schwa: /ə/

Diphthongs:
- /aɪ/, /aʊ/, /ɔɪ/, /ɛɪ/, /ɔʊ/

Some dialects may have additional vowels or diphthongs. For example, some varieties distinguish between /e:/ and /ɛ:/, or have an additional central vowel /ɵ/.

Vowel length is phonemic in Low German, meaning it can distinguish between words. For example:
- **Huus** /hu:s/ ('house') vs. **Huss** /hʊs/ ('quick')
- **Beet** /be:t/ ('bite') vs. **Bett** /bɛt/ ('bed')

### Consonants

The consonant system of Low German is similar to that of Standard German, with some notable differences:

| Manner | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Plosive | p b | t d | | k ɡ | |
| Nasal | m | n | | ŋ | |
| Fricative | f v | s z | ʃ | x | h |
| Approximant | | l | j | | |
| Trill | | r | | | |

Notable features:
- The sound [ç] (as in Standard German “ich”) is often realized as [ʃ] in Low German. For example, the word for “I” is often pronounced as [ɪʃ] rather than [ɪç].
- Many dialects lack the [z] sound, using [s] instead. This is particularly common in word-initial positions.
- The glottal stop [ʔ] is less prominent than in Standard German.
- The /r/ sound can vary significantly between dialects, ranging from a trilled [r] to an approximant [ɹ] or even a uvular [ʁ] in some areas.

### Phonological processes

1. Final devoicing: Like in Standard German, final obstruents are devoiced. This means that voiced consonants at the end of a word or syllable become voiceless.
   Examples: 
   - **Dag** [daːx] ('day'), but **Dage** [daːɡə] ('days')
   - **Rad** [ra:t] ('wheel'), but **Rader** [ra:dɐ] ('wheels')

2. Consonant cluster simplification: Some dialects simplify certain consonant clusters, especially those involving /p/ or /k/ followed by /f/ or /t/.
   Examples:
   - **Appel** instead of Standard German “Apfel” ('apple')
   - **Köpen** instead of Standard German “Kaufen” ('to buy')

3. Vowel lengthening: In many dialects, short vowels are lengthened before certain consonants, particularly before /r/, /l/, and sometimes /m/ or /n/.
   Examples:
   - **Glas** [ɡlaːs] ('glass')
   - **Barg** [baːrç] ('mountain')

4. Assimilation: Adjacent consonants often influence each other, leading to changes in pronunciation.
   Example:
   - **unbillig** ('unfair') is often pronounced [ʊmbɪlɪç], with the /n/ assimilating to the following /b/

5. Schwa deletion: In some dialects, the schwa (/ə/) is often deleted in unstressed syllables, particularly at the end of words.
   Example:
   - **Blome** ('flower') might be pronounced [blo:m] instead of [blo:mə]

## Orthography

Low German lacks a standardized orthography, and spelling can vary significantly between regions and writers. This diversity reflects the language's rich dialectal variation and its history of primarily oral use. However, there are some common conventions:

1. Long vowels are often indicated by doubling the vowel letter:
   **Boom** ('tree'), **Huus** ('house'), **Feet** ('feet')

2. The letter “j” is often used where Standard German uses “g”, especially at the end of words:
   **Daag** or **Daach** ('day'), **Weeg** ('way')

3. The digraph “ch” is often used for the [x] sound:
   **nich** ('not'), **Nacht** ('night')

4. The letter “ß” is not used; “ss” or “s” is used instead:
   **Water** ('water'), **Straat** ('street')

5. Umlaut letters (ä, ö, ü) are used in some orthographies but not in others. Some writers prefer to use “ae”, “oe”, and “ue” instead:
   **gröön** or **groen** ('green'), **Föte** or **Foete** ('feet')

6. The digraph “th” is often simplified to “t”:
   **Tiet** ('time'), **Doot** ('death')

7. Some writers use “v” where Standard German uses “f”:
   **Volk** ('people'), **vull** ('full')

8. The ending “-en” is often written as “-n” after consonants:
   **eten** ('to eat'), but **seggn** ('to say')

It's important to note that these conventions are not universally applied, and individual writers may have their own preferred spellings. This lack of standardization can make reading Low German texts challenging, especially for learners, but it also reflects the language's rich regional diversity.

## Grammar

### Nouns

Low German nouns have two genders (common and neuter) and two numbers (singular and plural). The case system has largely been lost in most dialects, with only vestiges remaining in pronouns and certain fixed expressions.

Gender:
- Common gender (combining masculine and feminine): **de Hund** ('the dog'), **de Katt** ('the cat')
- Neuter gender: **dat Huus** ('the house'), **dat Kind** ('the child')

Unlike Standard German, which has three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), Low German has merged masculine and feminine into a single “common” gender. This simplification is similar to what has happened in Dutch and English.

Plural formation varies, but common patterns include:

1. Adding -en:
   - **Hund** → **Hunnen** ('dogs')
   - **Boom** → **Bomen** ('trees')

2. Adding -s:
   - **Auto** → **Autos** ('cars')
   - **Radio** → **Radios** ('radios')

3. Changing the stem vowel (umlaut):
   - **Foot** → **Föt** ('feet')
   - **Muus** → **Müüs** ('mice')

4. No change (zero plural):
   - **Fisch** → **Fisch** ('fish', singular and plural)
   - **Deer** → **Deer** ('animal', singular and plural)

5. Adding -er (with or without umlaut):
   - **Kind** → **Kinner** ('children')
   - **Kalv** → **Kälver** ('calves')

Some nouns may have different plural forms in different dialects. For example, “house” might be pluralized as **Husen**, **Hüser**, or **Hüüs** depending on the dialect.

### Articles

Definite articles:
- Common gender: **de**
- Neuter gender: **dat**
- Plural (all genders): **de**

Indefinite article:
- All genders: **en** or **'n**

Examples:
- **de Mann** ('the man')
- **dat Kind** ('the child')
- **de Kinner** ('the children')
- **en Boom** ('a tree')

Unlike Standard German, Low German does not change the form of the article based on case. This simplification reflects the general loss of the case system in Low German.

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Low German have different forms depending on whether they are used attributively (before nouns) or predicatively (after verbs like “to be”).

Attributive adjectives are inflected:
- Common gender: **de grote Mann** ('the big man')
- Neuter gender: **dat grote Huus** ('the big house')
- Plural: **de groten Hunnen** ('the big dogs')

Predicative adjectives are not inflected:
- **De Mann is groot.** ('The man is big.')
- **Dat Huus is groot.** ('The house is big.')
- **De Hunnen sünd groot.** ('The dogs are big.')

Comparative and superlative forms are formed similarly to English:
- **groot** ('big'), **groter** ('bigger'), **grootst** ('biggest')
- **lütt** ('small'), **lütter** ('smaller'), **lüttst** ('smallest')

Irregular forms exist for some common adjectives:
- **good** ('good'), **beter** ('better'), **best** ('best')
- **veel** ('much/many'), **mehr** ('more'), **meest** ('most')

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Nominative | Accusative/Dative |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| 1sg    | ik         | mi                |
| 2sg    | du         | di                |
| 3sg m  | he         | em                |
| 3sg f  | se         | ehr               |
| 3sg n  | dat        | dat               |
| 1pl    | wi         | uns               |
| 2pl    | ji         | ju                |
| 3pl    | se         | ehr               |

Examples:
- **Ik seh di.** ('I see you.')
- **He gifft mi dat Book.** ('He gives me the book.')

Possessive pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1      | mien     | uns    |
| 2      | dien     | ju     |
| 3 m/n  | sien     | ehr    |
| 3 f    | ehr      | ehr    |

Examples:
- **mien Huus** ('my house')
- **ehr Katt** ('her cat' or 'their cat')

Demonstrative pronouns:
- **düsse** / **düt** ('this')
- **de** / **dat** ('that')

Examples:
- **Düsse Mann** ('this man')
- **Dat Book** ('that book')

Relative pronouns:
- **de** (for common gender and plural)
- **dat** (for neuter gender)

Example:
- **De Mann, de dor steiht, is mien Vadder.** ('The man who stands there is my father.')

Interrogative pronouns:
- **wokeen** ('who')
- **wat** ('what')
- **welk** ('which')

Example:
- **Wokeen hett dat seggt?** ('Who said that?')

### Verbs

Low German verbs are conjugated for person, number, tense, and mood. The infinitive typically ends in -en.

Present tense conjugation of **maken** ('to make'):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1      | ik maak  | wi maakt |
| 2      | du maakst | ji maakt |
| 3      | he/se/dat maakt | se maakt |

Past tense conjugation of **maken**:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1      | ik maak  | wi maken |
| 2      | du maakst | ji maken |
| 3      | he/se/dat maak | se maken |

Note that in many dialects, the past tense forms have merged with the present tense forms, and the distinction is made through context or auxiliary verbs.

Perfect tense is formed with **hebben** ('to have') or **wesen** ('to be') + past participle:
- **Ik heff maakt** ('I have made')
- **He is komen** ('He has come')

Future tense is formed with **warden** ('will') + infinitive:
- **Ik war maken** ('I will make')

Conditional is formed with **wull** ('would') + infinitive:
- **Ik wull maken** ('I would make')

Imperative:
- Singular: **Maak!** ('Make!')
- Plural: **Maakt!** ('Make!')

Participles:
- Present participle: **makend** ('making')
- Past participle: **maakt** ('made')

Strong verbs have vowel changes in their conjugation, similar to English “sing, sang, sung”:
- **driven** ('to drive'): **ik driev**, **ik dreev**, **ik heff dreven**
- **geven** ('to give'): **ik geev**, **ik gaff**, **ik heff geven**
- **kamen** ('to come'): **ik kaam**, **ik keem**, **ik bün kamen**

Modal verbs in Low German include:
- **könen** ('can')
- **möten** ('must')
- **schölen** ('shall')
- **willen** ('want')
- **mögen** ('may, like')
- **dörven** ('may, be allowed to')

These modal verbs have special conjugations. For example, the present tense of **könen**:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1      | ik kann  | wi könnt |
| 2      | du kannst | ji könnt |
| 3      | he/se/dat kann | se könnt |

The verb **wesen** ('to be') is irregular:

Present tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1      | ik bün   | wi sünd |
| 2      | du büst  | ji sünd |
| 3      | he/se/dat is | se sünd |

Past tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1      | ik weer  | wi weren |
| 2      | du weerst | ji weren |
| 3      | he/se/dat weer | se weren |

### Syntax

Word order in Low German is similar to that of Standard German and Dutch. The basic word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) in main clauses:

**Ik eet en Appel.** ('I eat an apple.')

In subordinate clauses, the verb typically moves to the end:

**Ik weet, dat he en Appel ett.** ('I know that he eats an apple.')

In questions, the verb comes before the subject:

**Ettst du en Appel?** ('Do you eat an apple?')

In compound tenses, the auxiliary verb takes the second position, and the main verb moves to the end:

**Ik heff güstern en Appel eten.** ('I ate an apple yesterday.')

Negation is typically formed with **nich** ('not'):

**Ik eet nich.** ('I don’t eat.')

Low German, like other Germanic languages, follows the V2 (verb-second) rule in main clauses. This means that the finite verb always takes the second position in the sentence, regardless of what comes first:

**Güstern heff ik en Appel eten.** ('Yesterday I ate an apple.')
**En Appel heff ik güstern eten.** ('An apple I ate yesterday.')

In subordinate clauses introduced by conjunctions like **dat** ('that'), **wenn** ('when', 'if'), or **wiel** ('because'), the verb moves to the end:

**Ik weet, dat he güstern en Appel eten hett.** ('I know that he ate an apple yesterday.')

Separable verbs, common in Germanic languages, are also present in Low German. These are verbs with a prefix that can be separated from the main verb in certain constructions:

**anfangen** ('to begin'):
**Ik fang de Arbeit an.** ('I begin the work.')
But: **Ik will de Arbeit anfangen.** ('I want to begin the work.')

### Adverbs

Many adverbs in Low German are formed by adding -s to adjectives:

- **gau** ('quick') → **gaus** ('quickly')
- **good** ('good') → **goods** ('well')

Some common adverbs:
- **nu** ('now')
- **hier** ('here')
- **dor** ('there')
- **faken** ('often')
- **glieks** ('soon')
- **noch** ('still', 'yet')
- **al** ('already')
- **jümmers** ('always')
- **bold** ('soon')
- **geern** ('gladly')

Adverbs typically come after the verb but before the object in a sentence:

**He snackt faken Plattdüütsch.** ('He often speaks Low German.')

However, for emphasis or stylistic reasons, adverbs can be moved to other positions in the sentence:

**Faken snackt he Plattdüütsch.** ('Often he speaks Low German.')

### Prepositions

Low German has many prepositions, often governing multiple cases (though case distinctions are less prominent in modern Low German). Some common prepositions:

- **in** ('in')
- **op** ('on')
- **mit** ('with')
- **to** ('to')
- **vun** ('from')
- **bi** ('by', 'near')
- **över** ('over')
- **ünner** ('under')
- **vör** ('before', 'in front of')
- **achter** ('behind')
- **twischen** ('between')
- **gegen** ('against')

Example:
**De Katt sitt op den Disch.** ('The cat sits on the table.')

Some prepositions can combine with adverbs to form prepositional adverbs:

**dorvun** ('thereof', 'of it')
**dorto** ('thereto', 'to it')
**dormit** ('therewith', 'with it')

Example:
**Ik heff nix dormit to doon.** ('I have nothing to do with it.')

### Conjunctions

Coordinating conjunctions:
- **un** ('and')
- **oder** ('or')
- **man** ('but')
- **denn** ('then')
- **aver** ('but', 'however')

Subordinating conjunctions:
- **dat** ('that')
- **wenn** ('when', 'if')
- **as** ('as', 'when')
- **wiel** ('because')
- **obschoonst** ('although')
- **bet** ('until')
- **sodat** ('so that')

Example:
**Ik weet nich, of he kümmt.** ('I don’t know if he's coming.')

## Vocabulary

   Meaning: It's going very smoothly or easily.

These idiomatic expressions often vary between dialects and regions, adding to the rich tapestry of Low German language and culture.

## Dialects and Variation

Low German encompasses a wide range of dialects, each with its own unique features. Some of the major dialect groups include:

1. Westphalian: Spoken in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and southern Lower Saxony.
2. Eastphalian: Spoken in southeastern Lower Saxony and parts of Saxony-Anhalt.
3. North Low Saxon: Spoken in northern Lower Saxony, Hamburg, and Schleswig-Holstein.
4. East Low German: Spoken in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg.
5. Plautdietsch: A distinct variety spoken by Mennonites, particularly in the Americas.

These dialects can differ significantly in vocabulary, pronunciation, and even some grammatical features. For example:

- The word for “girl” can be **Deern**, **Wicht**, or **Mäken** depending on the dialect.
- The pronoun “you” (plural) can be **ji**, **jü**, or **gü** in different regions.
- Some dialects retain more of the original case system than others.

Despite these differences, speakers of different Low German dialects can usually understand each other, although some adjustments might be necessary.

## Current Status and Revitalization Efforts

Low German is recognized as a regional language in Germany and the Netherlands under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. However, it faces challenges due to the dominance of Standard German in education, media, and public life.

Various efforts are underway to preserve and promote Low German:

1. Education: Some schools in northern Germany offer Low German classes or use it as a medium of instruction for certain subjects.

2. Media: There are radio programs, newspapers, and even some TV shows in Low German.

3. Literature: Many authors continue to write in Low German, preserving and developing the language's literary tradition.

4. Theater: Low German theater productions are popular in many regions.

5. Music: Some musicians perform in Low German, ranging from traditional folk to modern pop and rock.

6. Academic study: Universities in northern Germany often have departments or programs dedicated to Low German studies.

7. Language societies: Organizations like the Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache work to promote and preserve the language.

Despite these efforts, the number of active speakers has been declining, particularly among younger generations. However, there is a growing awareness of the cultural value of Low German, and many people are showing renewed interest in learning and preserving this rich linguistic heritage.

This comprehensive overview covers the main aspects of Low German, including its history, phonology, grammar, vocabulary, and current status. It provides a solid foundation for understanding this important Germanic language and its place in the linguistic landscape of northern Europe.
