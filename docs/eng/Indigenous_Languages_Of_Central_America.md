# Indigenous Languages Of Central America

Central America is home to a rich tapestry of indigenous languages, many of which predate European colonization. These languages belong to several language families and exhibit a wide range of linguistic features. This overview will focus on the major language groups and their characteristics, providing detailed linguistic information and examples.

## Mayan Languages

The Mayan language family is one of the most prominent in Central America, with around 30 living languages spoken primarily in Guatemala, southern Mexico, Belize, and parts of Honduras and El Salvador. Mayan languages are known for their complex morphology, ergative-absolutive alignment, and rich historical documentation through hieroglyphic writing.

### Phonology

Mayan languages generally have relatively simple vowel systems but complex consonant inventories. Many Mayan languages distinguish between plain and glottalized consonants, and some also have contrastive aspiration.

K'iche', one of the most widely spoken Mayan languages, has the following phonemic inventory:

Consonants:
| | Bilabial | Alveolar | Palato-alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
|--|----------|----------|-----------------|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| Plosive | p p' | t t' | | | k k' | q q' | ʔ |
| Affricate | | ts ts' | tʃ tʃ' | | | | |
| Fricative | | s | ʃ | | | χ | h |
| Nasal | m | n | | | | | |
| Liquid | | l r | | | | | |
| Approximant | w | | | j | | | |

Vowels:
| | Front | Central | Back |
|--|-------|---------|------|
| Close | i iː | | u uː |
| Mid | e eː | | o oː |
| Open | | a aː | |

Example words in K'iche':
- **tz'i'** [tsʼiʔ] - 'dog'
- **k'iche'** [kʼitʃeʔ] - 'forest'
- **q'ij** [qʼix] - 'sun, day'
- **xak'op** [ʃakʼop] - 'grasshopper'
- **b'alam** [ɓalam] - 'jaguar'

Yucatec Maya, spoken primarily in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, has a more complex vowel system that includes contrastive vowel length and a distinction between modal and laryngealized vowels:

Vowels:
| | Front | Central | Back |
|--|-------|---------|------|
| Close | i iː ḭ ḭː | | u uː ṵ ṵː |
| Mid | e eː ḛ ḛː | | o oː o̰ o̰ː |
| Open | | a aː a̰ a̰ː | |

Example words in Yucatec Maya:
- **k'áan** [kʼáːn] - 'hammock'
- **k'a'an** [kʼa̰ːn] - 'strong'
- **ch'íich'** [tʃʼíːtʃʼ] - 'bird'
- **chúuk** [tʃúːk] - 'charcoal'
- **chu'uk** [tʃṵːk] - 'sweet'

### Morphology

Mayan languages are polysynthetic and ergative-absolutive. They use both prefixes and suffixes to mark grammatical relations, aspect, mood, and other categories.

#### Ergativity

In ergative-absolutive languages, the subject of an intransitive verb is marked the same way as the object of a transitive verb (absolutive), while the subject of a transitive verb is marked differently (ergative).

Example in K'iche':

1. **X-in-war-ik** - 'I slept'
   x-: completive aspect
   -in-: 1st person singular absolutive
   war: 'sleep'
   -ik: intransitive verb suffix

2. **X-at-in-kuna-j** - 'I cured you'
   x-: completive aspect
   -at-: 2nd person singular absolutive (object)
   -in-: 1st person singular ergative (subject)
   kuna: 'cure'
   -j: transitive verb suffix

3. **X-∅-qa-loq'-o** - 'We bought it'
   x-: completive aspect
   -∅-: 3rd person singular absolutive (object)
   -qa-: 1st person plural ergative (subject)
   loq': 'buy'
   -o: transitive verb suffix

#### Aspect and Mood

Mayan languages typically mark aspect rather than tense. Common aspects include completive, incompletive, and perfect. Many Mayan languages also have a rich system of modal markers.

Example in Yucatec Maya:

- **Táan in janal** - 'I am eating' (progressive aspect)
- **Ts'o'ok in janal** - 'I have eaten' (perfect aspect)
- **Bíin in janal** - 'I will eat' (future/prospective aspect)
- **Jaanten!** - 'Eat!' (imperative mood)
- **Janak in wóok'ol** - 'I wish I would eat' (optative mood)

#### Positionals

Many Mayan languages have a distinct word class called positionals, which describe the position or state of an object. These often have their own set of aspectual and derivational affixes.

Example in Tzeltal:

- **waxal** - 'standing upright (of a cylinder)'
- **chepel** - 'lying on one's side'
- **pachal** - 'sitting (of a container)'

These can be used in sentences like:

**Waxal ta mexa te limeteho**
standing.upright PREP table DEF bottle
'The bottle is standing upright on the table'

### Syntax

Mayan languages generally have a verb-initial word order (either VSO or VOS), although SVO is also common in many modern Mayan languages due to Spanish influence.

Example in Tzotzil (VSO):

**Ch-i-s-mil-∅ li vinik-e**
ASP-1ABS-3ERG-kill-3ABS DEF man-ENC
'The man kills me'

Example in Yucatec Maya (VOS):

**T-u-hàant-ah òon le pèek'-o'**
PFV-3ERG-eat-CMPL avocado DEF dog-ENC
'The dog ate the avocado'

Mayan languages often use topic-comment structures, where the topic is fronted:

**Le wakax-o', t-u-hàant-ah le su'uk-o'**
DEF cow-ENC, PFV-3ERG-eat-CMPL DEF grass-ENC
'As for the cow, it ate the grass'

### Numeral Classifiers

Many Mayan languages use numeral classifiers, which are words that categorize nouns based on their shape, material, or other properties when counting.

Example in Tzeltal:

**oxeb kojt' ts'i'**
three-CLF(animal) dog
'three dogs'

**chaneb p'ej ton**
four-CLF(round) stone
'four stones'

### Directionals

Mayan languages often have a rich system of directional particles that indicate the direction of an action. These can combine with verbs to create complex meanings.

Example in K'iche':

**X-∅-in-k'am-ub'i**
CMPL-3ABS-1ERG-carry-away
'I carried it away'

**X-∅-in-k'am-uloq**
CMPL-3ABS-1ERG-carry-hither
'I brought it here'

## Nahuatl

Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, is still spoken by over 1.5 million people in central Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Uto-Aztecan language family and is known for its polysynthetic structure and complex morphology.

### Phonology

Classical Nahuatl had a relatively simple phonological system:

Consonants:
| | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--|--------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Plosive | p | t | | k | kʷ |
| Affricate | | ts | tʃ | | |
| Fricative | | s | ʃ | | h |
| Nasal | m | n | | | |
| Liquid | | l | | | |
| Approximant | w | | j | | |

Vowels:
| | Front | Central | Back |
|--|-------|---------|------|
| Close | i iː | | o oː |
| Open | e eː | | a aː |

Modern varieties of Nahuatl may have additional phonemes due to Spanish influence. For example, many modern dialects have incorporated /b/, /d/, /g/, and /f/ from Spanish loanwords.

Example words in Classical Nahuatl:
- **tlālli** [tɬaːɬːi] - 'land, earth'
- **xōchitl** [ʃoːtʃitɬ] - 'flower'
- **coyōtl** [kojoːtɬ] - 'coyote'
- **tēuctli** [teːktɬi] - 'lord, noble'

### Morphology

Nahuatl is highly agglutinative and polysynthetic, with complex verb morphology. A single Nahuatl word can often express what would require an entire sentence in other languages.

#### Noun Incorporation

Nahuatl is known for its extensive use of noun incorporation, where noun stems can be incorporated into verb stems to form complex predicates.

Examples:
- **Ni-naka-kwa** - 'I eat meat'
  ni-: 1st person singular subject prefix
  naka-: 'meat' (incorporated noun)
  kwa: 'eat'

- **Ni-chān-chiwa** - 'I make a house'
  ni-: 1st person singular subject prefix
  chān-: 'house' (incorporated noun)
  chiwa: 'make'

#### Honorifics

Nahuatl has an elaborate system of honorifics, with different verb forms used depending on the social status of the speaker and addressee.

Examples:
- **Tikkwa** - 'You eat' (neutral)
- **Timotlakwaltia** - 'You eat' (respectful)
- **Ximotlakwalti** - 'Please eat' (very respectful)

#### Causatives and Applicatives

Nahuatl has productive morphological processes for creating causative and applicative verbs:

Causative:
- **Miki** - 'to die'
- **Miktia** - 'to kill' (literally, 'to cause to die')

Applicative:
- **Chōka** - 'to cry'
- **Chōkilia** - 'to cry for someone/something'

#### Reduplication

Reduplication is used in Nahuatl to express various meanings, including plurality, intensity, or repetition:

- **Tzilīni** - 'it rings'
- **Tzitzilīni** - 'it rings repeatedly'

### Syntax

Nahuatl has a basic Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, although other orders are possible due to its rich morphology.

Example:
**Neh no-pil-tzin ∅-ki-neki tlaxkal-li**
I my-child-HON 3SG.SUB-3SG.OBJ-want bread-ABS
'My respected child wants bread'

Nahuatl uses a system of prefixes to mark subject and object agreement on verbs:

**Ni-mitz-tta**
1SG.SUB-2SG.OBJ-see
'I see you'

**Ti-nech-tta**
2SG.SUB-1SG.OBJ-see
'You see me'

### Locatives

Nahuatl has a rich system of locative suffixes that can be added to nouns to indicate location:

- **Kāl-ko** - 'in the house' (-ko: 'in')
- **Tepē-tlan** - 'at the foot of the mountain' (-tlan: 'near, at the base of')
- **Ā-c** - 'in the water' (-c: 'in, among')

## Chibchan Languages
