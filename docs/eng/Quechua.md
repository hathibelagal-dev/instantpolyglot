# Quechua

Quechua, also known as Runa Simi ("people's language"), is a family of Indigenous languages spoken primarily in the Andean regions of South America. It was the official language of the Inca Empire and continues to be spoken by millions of people across Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and parts of Colombia and Argentina. There are several major varieties of Quechua, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.

## Historical Context

Quechua's origins can be traced back to the central Andes region of Peru, possibly as far back as 2000 BCE. The language family expanded significantly during the time of the Inca Empire (15th-16th centuries CE), which used Quechua as its administrative language. After the Spanish conquest, Quechua continued to be widely used, with Spanish missionaries often learning and documenting the language for evangelization purposes.

Today, Quechua is recognized as an official language in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, alongside Spanish. However, it faces challenges due to the increasing dominance of Spanish in education, media, and official contexts.

## Phonology

Quechua phonology varies between dialects, but most varieties share a core set of sounds. The following description is based primarily on Southern Quechua (Qusqu-Qullaw), one of the most widely spoken varieties.

### Consonants

| Manner | Bilabial | Alveolar | Postalveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
|--------|----------|----------|--------------|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| Plosive | p | t | | | k | q | |
| Aspirated | pʰ | tʰ | | | kʰ | qʰ | |
| Ejective | p' | t' | | | k' | q' | |
| Nasal | m | n | | ɲ | | | |
| Fricative | | s | ʃ | | | χ | h |
| Affricate | | ts | tʃ | | | | |
| Approximant | w | l | | j | | | |
| Tap | | ɾ | | | | | |

Note: Not all dialects have the full set of aspirated and ejective consonants. Some dialects, particularly in central Peru, lack the uvular consonants entirely.

Examples:
**punku** [ˈpuŋku] "door"
**thanta** [ˈtʰanta] "old, worn out"
**q'umir** [ˈq'umiɾ] "green"
**ñan** [ɲan] "road"
**chaki** [ˈtʃaki] "foot"

### Vowels

Quechua typically has three vowel phonemes:

| Front | Central | Back |
|-------|---------|------|
| i | | u |
| | a | |

In some dialects, especially those influenced by Spanish, [e] and [o] appear as allophones of /i/ and /u/ respectively when adjacent to uvular consonants.

Examples:
**quri** [ˈqoɾi] "gold" (compare with **kiru** [ˈkiɾu] "tooth")
**qucha** [ˈqotʃa] "lake" (compare with **punchaw** [ˈpuntʃaw] "day")

### Phonological Processes

1. Vowel Lengthening: In some dialects, vowels are lengthened before uvular consonants:
   **saqra** [ˈsa:qɾa] "demon"

2. Consonant Assimilation: Nasals often assimilate to the place of articulation of following consonants:
   **sunqu** [ˈsuŋqu] "heart"

3. Final Vowel Devoicing: In some dialects, word-final vowels are often devoiced or dropped entirely in rapid speech:
   **wasi** [ˈwasi̥] or [was] "house"

### Stress

Stress in Quechua is generally predictable, falling on the penultimate syllable of a word:

**wasi** [ˈwa.si] "house"
**wasikunapi** [wa.si.ˈku.na.pi] "in the houses"

However, some suffixes can affect stress placement:
**wasiyoq** [wa.ˈsi.joq] "house owner"

## Orthography

Several orthographic systems exist for Quechua, reflecting both historical developments and modern standardization efforts. The most common standardized system uses the following letters:

a, ch, h, i, k, l, ll, m, n, ñ, p, q, r, s, t, u, w, y

Some dialects also use:

chh, ch', k', p', q', t' (for ejectives)
ph, th, kh, qh (for aspirated consonants)

Examples:
**chaki** "foot"
**ch'aki** "dry"
**khuyay** "to love"
**llaqta** "town"
**ñan** "road"

It's worth noting that older texts and some regions may use different orthographic conventions, such as:

- Using 'cc' instead of 'q': **ccori** instead of **quri** "gold"
- Using 'hua' instead of 'wa': **huasi** instead of **wasi** "house"
- Using 'j' instead of 'h': **jatun** instead of **hatun** "big"

## Morphology

Quechua is a highly agglutinative language, with a rich system of suffixes that modify nouns, verbs, and other parts of speech. This allows for the creation of very complex words that can express ideas that would require entire phrases in languages like English.

### Nouns

Nouns in Quechua can take numerous suffixes to indicate various grammatical and semantic features.

1. Number:

## Syntax

Quechua generally follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, although this can be flexible due to the case marking system.

Basic sentence structure:
**Mariaq wawan t'antata mikun.**
Maria-GEN child-3POSS bread-ACC eat-3SG
"Maria's child eats bread."

**Runakunaqa llaqtapi tiyanku.**
People-PL-TOP town-LOC live-3PL
"The people live in the town."

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed using the particle **mana** before the verb and the suffix -chu on the verb:

**Mana mikunichu.** "I don't eat."
**Mana rimasaqchu.** "I will not speak."
**Mana allinchu.** "It's not good."

In compound sentences, only the last verb takes the -chu suffix:
**Mana mikuni nitaq upyanichu.** "I neither eat nor drink."

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the suffix -chu to the questioned element:

**Rimanki.** "You speak."
**Rimankichu?** "Do you speak?"

**Llaqtamanchu rinki?** "Are you going to town?"

Wh-questions use interrogative words such as:

**pi** "who"
**ima** "what"
**maypi** "where"
**imayna** "how"
**hayk'a** "how many/much"
**imapaq** "why"

These typically appear at the beginning of the sentence:

**Maypin tiyanki?** "Where do you live?"
**Pita qhawarqanki?** "Whom did you see?"
**Imatan ruranki?** "What are you doing?"
**Hayk'a watayuqmi kanki?** "How old are you?"

### Subordinate Clauses

Subordinate clauses in Quechua are often formed using nominalized verbs with case markers:

1. Relative clauses use the suffix -q for subject relatives and -sqa for object relatives:

**Qhawasqay runa hamun.** "The man (whom) I saw is coming."
**Qhawaq runa hamun.** "The man who saw is coming."

2. Complement clauses often use the nominalizer -na with possessive suffixes:

**Rimanaykit munani.** "I want you to speak."
(Literally: "I want your speaking.")

3. Adverbial clauses use various suffixes:

Temporal: -qti (different subject), -spa (same subject)
**Mikuqtiyki, ñuqa llank'asaq.** "While you eat, I will work."
**Mikuspay, ñuqa llank'asaq.** "After eating, I will work."

Causal: -rayku
**Unqurayku mana hamunichu.** "I didn't come because I was sick."

Conditional: -qti(n)
**Paramunqatin, mana risaqchu.** "If it rains, I won't go."

Purpose: -napa
**Yachachinapayki hamuni.** "I came to teach you."

4. Direct and Indirect Speech:

Quechua uses the suffix -s(i) to indicate reported speech:
**Hamunqas.** "He said he will come."

Direct quotations can be marked with the verb **niy** "to say":
**"Hamusaq" nispa nin.** "He says, 'I will come.'"

### Topicalization

Quechua uses the suffix -qa to mark the topic of a sentence:
**Wasiykiqa hatunmi.** "As for your house, it is big."

### Focus

The suffix -mi (or its allomorphs -n after vowels) is used to mark focus and assertion:
**Pedrom hamun.** "It was Pedro who came."

### Evidentiality

Quechua has a system of evidential markers that indicate the source of information:

-mi (direct experience): **Parashan-mi.** "It's raining." (I see it raining)
-si (hearsay): **Parashan-si.** "It's raining." (I was told it's raining)
-chá (inference): **Parashan-chá.** "It must be raining." (I infer it's raining)

These evidential markers can be used with different parts of speech:
**Hatun-mi wasi.** "The house is big." (I've seen it)
**Hatun-si wasi.** "The house is big." (I'm told)
**Hatun-chá wasi.** "The house must be big." (I infer)

## Vocabulary

**ch'arki** → "jerky" (dried meat)
**pampa** → "pampas" (grasslands)

## Dialectal Variation

Quechua encompasses a variety of dialects, often grouped into two main branches:

1. Quechua I (Central Quechua): Spoken in central Peru
2. Quechua II (Peripheral Quechua): Spoken in southern Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and parts of Argentina

Major differences between dialects include:

Phonological variations:
- Some dialects retain the distinction between velar /k/ and uvular /q/, while others have merged them.
- The phoneme /s/ in some dialects corresponds to /h/ in others.
- Some dialects have lost the aspirated and ejective consonants.

Lexical differences:
- **yaku** (Cuzco Quechua) vs. **yacu** (Ecuadorian Quechua) for "water"
- **wasi** (Cuzco Quechua) vs. **huasi** (Ecuadorian Quechua) for "house"
- **allqu** (Ayacucho Quechua) vs. **alqo** (Cuzco Quechua) for "dog"

Grammatical differences:
- Variation in the use of evidential markers
- Different forms for some verbal suffixes
- Presence or absence of certain grammatical distinctions (e.g., inclusive vs. exclusive first person plural)

Example sentence in two dialects:

Cuzco Quechua:
**Wasiy hatunmi.**
"My house is big." (I'm certain)

Ecuadorian Quechua:
**Ñuca huasi jatunmi can.**
"My house is big." (I'm certain)

## Idiomatic Expressions

Quechua has many idiomatic expressions that reflect Andean culture and worldview:

**Sonqoyta suwanki.** (Literally: "You stole my heart.")
Meaning: "I fell in love with you."

**Ama suwa, ama llulla, ama qilla.**
Literally: "Don't steal, don't lie, don't be lazy."
This was a central ethical code of the Inca Empire.

**Ñawi rurun**
Literally: "eye fruit"
Meaning: "pupil of the eye"

**Allin p'unchay kachun.**
Literally: "May it be a good day."
Used as a greeting, similar to "Have a nice day."

Meaning: A gentle, kind-hearted person

**Rumi sonqo**
Literally: "Stone heart"
Meaning: A hard-hearted, unsympathetic person

**Qamllam kanki**
Literally: "You alone are"
A romantic expression meaning "You are the only one for me"

## Honorifics and Politeness

Quechua has several ways to show respect and politeness:

1. Use of the suffix -lla (diminutive) to soften requests:
   **Yanapallaway.** "Please help me."
   **Hamullay.** "Please come."

2. Use of kinship terms as honorifics:
   **Taytáy** "Sir" (literally "my father")
   **Mamáy** "Madam" (literally "my mother")
   **Panay** "Sister" (used for a woman of similar age)
   **Turay** "Brother" (used for a man of similar age)

   **Yakunayawanmi.** "I'm thirsty." (Literally: "Water is calling me.")
   Used as an indirect way to ask for water.

## Traditional Narratives

Quechua has a rich oral tradition of stories and legends. Here's a short example of a traditional Quechua narrative with translation:

**Huk kutis huk atuqwan huk kunturwan tinkurqanku. Atuqqa nirqa: "Ñuqaqa allinta phawani". Kunturñataq kutichirqa: "Ñuqataq sumaqta phawani". Chaymanta iskaynin atipanakuyta qallarirqanku. Atuqqa allpapi phawarqa, kunturñataq hanaq pachapi. Tukuypi kunturqa atipasqa. Atuqqa p'inqakuspa ripurqa, kunturñataq kusisqa huk urquman tiyaykurqa.**

"Once upon a time, a fox and a condor met. The fox said: 'I run very well'. The condor replied: 'And I fly beautifully'. Then they both started to compete. The fox ran on the ground, while the condor flew in the sky. In the end, the condor won. The fox left, embarrassed, while the condor sat happily on a mountain."

This brief tale illustrates the common theme of competition between animals in Andean folklore, often used to explain natural phenomena or teach moral lessons. It also showcases several grammatical features of Quechua, such as the narrative past tense (-rqa-), the contrastive topic marker (-ñataq), and various verbal suffixes.

## Influence on Andean Spanish

Quechua has significantly influenced the varieties of Spanish spoken in the Andean region. Some features of Andean Spanish that show Quechua influence include:

1. Pronunciation:
   - Distinction between /ʎ/ and /j/ (maintained in Quechua but merged in most Spanish dialects)
   - Tendency to stress the penultimate syllable, even in words where standard Spanish doesn't

2. Vocabulary:
   - Use of Quechua loanwords: **wawa** "baby", **calato** "naked" (from Quechua **q'ala**)

3. Grammar:
   - Use of the diminutive -ito/-ita with adverbs: **ahorita** "right now"
   - Double possessives: **su casa de Juan** "Juan's house" (reflecting Quechua possessive structure)
   - Use of **dice** as a reportative evidential, mirroring Quechua -s(i)

4. Syntax:
   - Object-Verb word order in some constructions: **La papa pelando estoy** "I'm peeling the potato"

These features vary in prevalence depending on the specific region and the speaker's background.

In conclusion, Quechua is a complex and expressive language with a rich history and ongoing cultural significance. Its intricate morphology, evidential system, and close ties to Andean culture make it a fascinating subject of study for linguists and language enthusiasts alike. Despite facing challenges in the modern era, efforts are being made to preserve and promote Quechua, recognizing its importance as a vital part of Indigenous heritage in South America.
