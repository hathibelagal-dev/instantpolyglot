Here's a detailed overview of the Irish language, following the structure and style you requested:

# Irish

Irish (Gaeilge) is a Goidelic language of the Insular Celtic branch of the Celtic language family. It is spoken as a first language by a small minority of Irish people and as a second language by a larger group. Irish is one of the official languages of Ireland and an official language of the European Union.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Irish uses a Latin-based alphabet with 18 letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u. The letters j, k, q, v, w, x, y, z are only used in loanwords.

### Vowels

Irish has both short and long vowels. Long vowels are marked with an acute accent (fada) over the vowel.

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| a | [a] or [ə] |
| á | [ɑː] |
| e | [ɛ] or [ə] |
| é | [eː] |
| i | [ɪ] or [ə] |
| í | [iː] |
| o | [ɔ] or [ə] |
| ó | [oː] |
| u | [ʊ] or [ə] |
| ú | [uː] |

### Consonants

Irish consonants can be either broad (velarized) or slender (palatalized). This distinction is crucial for pronunciation and grammar.

| Letter | Broad | Slender |
|--------|-------|---------|
| b | [b] | [bʲ] |
| c | [k] | [c] |
| d | [d] | [dʲ] |
| f | [f] | [fʲ] |
| g | [ɡ] | [ɟ] |
| h | [h] | [h] |
| l | [l̪ˠ] | [lʲ] |
| m | [m] | [mʲ] |
| n | [n̪ˠ] | [nʲ] |
| p | [p] | [pʲ] |
| r | [ɾˠ] | [ɾʲ] |
| s | [s] | [ʃ] |
| t | [t] | [tʲ] |

### Consonant mutations

Irish has two types of initial consonant mutations: lenition and eclipsis.

Lenition (séimhiú) is marked by adding 'h' after the initial consonant:

| Original | Lenited | Sound change |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| b | bh | [b] → [v]/[w] |
| c | ch | [k] → [x] |
| d | dh | [d] → [ɣ] |
| f | fh | [f] → silent |
| g | gh | [ɡ] → [ɣ] |
| m | mh | [m] → [v]/[w] |
| p | ph | [p] → [f] |
| s | sh | [s] → [h] |
| t | th | [t] → [h] |

Eclipsis (urú) involves adding a letter before the initial consonant:

| Original | Eclipsed | Sound change |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| b | mb | [b] → [m] |
| c | gc | [k] → [g] |
| d | nd | [d] → [n] |
| f | bhf | [f] → [v]/[w] |
| g | ng | [ɡ] → [ŋ] |
| p | bp | [p] → [b] |
| t | dt | [t] → [d] |

Examples:
- **bean** [bʲan] (woman) → **an bhean** [ən vʲan] (the woman)
- **cat** [kat] (cat) → **mo chat** [mə xat] (my cat)
- **bád** [bɑːd] (boat) → **ar an mbád** [ɛr ə mɑːd] (on the boat)

### Stress

In most Irish words, the stress falls on the first syllable. However, in some dialects, particularly in Munster Irish, long vowels in non-initial syllables attract stress.

Examples:
- **cailín** [ˈkalʲiːnʲ] (girl)
- **amadán** [ˈamədɑːn] (fool)
- Munster: **cailín** [kaˈlʲiːnʲ], **amadán** [aməˈdɑːn]

## Morphology

### Nouns

Irish nouns have gender (masculine or feminine), number (singular or plural), and case (nominative, genitive, dative, vocative).

#### Gender

Noun gender affects article forms, initial mutations, and adjective agreement. Some general rules for gender:

- Masculine nouns:
  - Most nouns ending in a broad consonant
  - Nouns denoting males

- Feminine nouns:
  - Most nouns ending in a slender consonant
  - Most abstract nouns ending in -acht
  - Nouns denoting females

Examples:
- Masculine: **fear** (man), **cat** (cat), **bád** (boat)
- Feminine: **bean** (woman), **cathair** (city), **bróg** (shoe)

#### Number

Plural formation in Irish is complex, with many patterns:

1. Adding -a or -e:
   **cat** → **cait** (cats)
   **bád** → **báid** (boats)

2. Slenderizing the final consonant:
   **bord** → **boird** (tables)

3. Broadening the final consonant:
   **sráid** → **sráideanna** (streets)

4. Adding -anna or -eanna:
   **leabhar** → **leabhair** (books)

5. Irregular plurals:
   **bean** → **mná** (women)
   **teach** → **tithe** (houses)

#### Case

The four cases in Irish are:

1. Nominative (used for subjects and predicates)
2. Genitive (used for possession and after certain prepositions)
3. Dative (used after simple prepositions)
4. Vocative (used for direct address)

Examples:
- Nominative: **Tá an fear anseo.** (The man is here.)
- Genitive: **hata an fhir** (the man's hat)
- Dative: **leis an bhfear** (with the man)
- Vocative: **A fhir!** (O man!)

### Articles

Irish has a definite article but no indefinite article. The definite article has different forms depending on gender, case, and whether the following noun begins with a vowel or consonant.

Singular:
- Masculine: **an** (nominative/dative), **an** (genitive)
- Feminine: **an** (nominative/dative), **na** (genitive)

Plural (all genders):
- **na** (all cases)

Examples:
- **an fear** (the man)
- **na fir** (the men)
- **an bhean** (the woman)
- **na mná** (the women)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Irish usually follow the noun they modify and agree in gender, number, and case.

Examples:
- **fear mór** (big man)
- **bean mhór** (big woman)
- **fir mhóra** (big men)
- **mná móra** (big women)

Comparative and superlative forms are created using the particle **níos** (more) and **is** (most):

- **mór** (big) → **níos mó** (bigger) → **is mó** (biggest)
- **beag** (small) → **níos lú** (smaller) → **is lú** (smallest)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Irish:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **mé** | **muid/sinn** |
| 2nd | **tú** | **sibh** |
| 3rd (masc.) | **sé** | **siad** |
| 3rd (fem.) | **sí** | **siad** |

Prepositional pronouns are formed by combining prepositions with personal pronouns:

- **ag** (at) + **mé** → **agam** (at me)
- **le** (with) + **tú** → **leat** (with you)

Examples:
- **Tá leabhar agam.** (I have a book.)
- **Tá sé leat.** (It's with you.)

### Verbs

Irish verbs are conjugated for person, number, tense, mood, and voice. The basic form of the verb is the imperative singular.

#### Present tense

Regular verbs form the present tense by adding endings to the stem:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | -aim | -aimid |
| 2nd | -ann tú | -ann sibh |
| 3rd | -ann sé/sí | -ann siad |

Example with **bris** (to break):

- **Brisim** (I break)
- **Briseann tú** (You break)
- **Briseann sé** (He breaks)
- **Brisimid** (We break)
- **Briseann sibh** (You (pl.) break)
- **Briseann siad** (They break)

#### Past tense

The past tense is formed by leniting the initial consonant (if possible) and adding endings:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | - | -amar |
| 2nd | -is | - |
| 3rd | - | -adar |

Example with **bris**:

- **Bhris mé** (I broke)
- **Bhris tú** (You broke)
- **Bhris sé** (He broke)
- **Bhriseamar** (We broke)
- **Bhris sibh** (You (pl.) broke)
- **Bhriseadar** (They broke)

#### Future tense

The future tense is formed by adding -f(a)idh to the stem:

- **Brisfidh mé** (I will break)
- **Brisfidh tú** (You will break)
- **Brisfidh sé** (He will break)
- **Brisfimid** (We will break)
- **Brisfidh sibh** (You (pl.) will break)
- **Brisfidh siad** (They will break)

#### Conditional mood

The conditional is formed by adding -f(e)adh to the stem:

- **Bhrisfinn** (I would break)
- **Bhrisfeá** (You would break)
- **Bhrisfeadh sé** (He would break)
- **Bhrisfeadh muid** (We would break)
- **Bhrisfeadh sibh** (You (pl.) would break)
- **Bhrisfeadh siad** (They would break)

#### Verbal nouns and adjectives

Irish uses verbal nouns and adjectives extensively:

- Verbal noun: **briseadh** (breaking)
- Verbal adjective: **briste** (broken)

Examples:
- **Tá sé ag briseadh na fuinneoige.** (He is breaking the window.)
- **Tá an fhuinneog briste.** (The window is broken.)

## Syntax

### Word order

Irish primarily uses Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) word order:

**Léann an cailín an leabhar.** (The girl reads the book.)
V     S         O

In compound tenses, the order becomes Auxiliary Verb-Subject-Verbal Noun-Object:

**Tá an cailín ag léamh an leabhair.** (The girl is reading the book.)
AuxV S         VN     O

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by using the interrogative particle **an** (eclipses initial consonant) or **ar** (lenites) for past tense:

- **An bhfuil tú go maith?** (Are you well?)
- **Ar ól tú caife?** (Did you drink coffee?)

Negative questions use **nach** or **nár** (past tense):

- **Nach bhfuil tú go maith?** (Aren't you well?)
- **Nár ól tú caife?** (Didn't you drink coffee?)

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns:

- **Cé** (who): **Cé hé sin?** (Who is that?)
- **Cad** (what): **Cad atá agat?** (What do you have?)
- **Conas** (how): **Conas atá tú?** (How are you?)
- **Cén fáth** (why): **Cén fáth a bhfuil tú anseo?** (Why are you here?)

### Negation

Negation is formed using the particle **ní** (lenites) or **níor** (past tense):

- **Ní thuigim.** (I don't understand.)
- **Níor ól mé caife.** (I didn't drink coffee.)

### Copula

Irish uses two verbs for "to be":

1. **Tá** (the substantive verb):
   Used for descriptions, states, and locations.
   **Tá mé tuirseach.** (I am tired.)
   **Tá sé sa teach.** (He is in the house.)

2. **Is** (the copula):
   Used for definitions, identifications, and classifications.
   **Is múinteoir mé.** (I am a teacher.)
   **Is é Seán an fear.** (Seán is the man.)

### Relative clauses

Irish uses direct and indirect relative clauses:

Direct (when the antecedent is the subject of the relative clause):
**An fear a bhris an fhuinneog.** (The man who broke the window.)

Indirect (when the antecedent is not the subject):
**An fhuinneog a bhris an fear.** (The window that the man broke.)

### Possession

Possession is expressed using the preposition **ag** with the verb **bí** (to be):

**Tá leabhar agam.** (I have a book.) (Literally: A book is at me.)
**Tá carr ag Máire.** (Máire has a car.) (Literally: A car is at Máire.)

### Emphatic particles

Irish uses emphatic particles to stress pronouns and possessive adjectives:

- **mise** (me, emphatic)
- **tusa** (you, emphatic)
- **mo theachsa** (my house, emphatic)

Example:
**Is mise an múinteoir.** (I am the teacher. - emphatic)

## Dialectal variations

Irish has three main dialects: Munster (An Mhumhain), Connacht (Connachta), and Ulster (Ulaidh). While they share core grammar and vocabulary, there are notable differences:

1. Pronunciation:
   - Munster: stress on long vowels in non-initial syllables
   - Connacht and Ulster: stress generally on the first syllable

2. Vocabulary:
   - "How are you?":
     Munster: **Conas atá tú?**
     Connacht: **Cén chaoi a bhfuil tú?**
     Ulster: **Cad é mar atá tú?**

3. Grammar:
   - First person plural pronoun:
     Munster and Connacht: **muid**
     Ulster: **sinn**

   - Synthetic verb forms (incorporating the pronoun):
     More common in Munster, less so in other dialects
     Munster: **Déanaimid** (We do)
     Other dialects: **Déanann muid** (We do)

## Idiomatic expressions

Irish has many idiomatic expressions that reflect its unique cultural and linguistic heritage:

1. **Go raibh maith agat** - Thank you (lit. "May you have good")

2. **Sláinte** - Cheers (lit. "Health")

## Verbal nouns and the progressive aspect

Irish makes extensive use of verbal nouns to express ongoing actions. This is similar to the English -ing form but is used more extensively.

Formation:
1. Adding -adh or -eadh to the verb stem:
   **bris** (break) → **briseadh** (breaking)
   **dún** (close) → **dúnadh** (closing)

2. Adding -ú to the verb stem:
   **glan** (clean) → **glanadh** (cleaning)

3. Irregular formations:
   **ith** (eat) → **ithe** (eating)
   **ól** (drink) → **ól** (drinking)

Usage:
1. With **ag** to form progressive tenses:
   **Tá mé ag briseadh na fuinneoige.** (I am breaking the window.)
   **Bhí siad ag glanadh an tí.** (They were cleaning the house.)

2. As a noun:
   **Is maith liom léamh.** (I like reading.)

3. After prepositions:
   **roimh dhul abhaile** (before going home)

## Autonomous form

Irish has a special verb form called the autonomous or impersonal form. It's used when the agent of the action is not specified, similar to passive voice in English, but it's considered an active form in Irish.

Formation:
Present: add -tar or -tear to the verb stem
Past: add -adh or -eadh to the verb stem
Future: add -far or -fear to the verb stem
Conditional: add -faí or -fí to the verb stem

Examples:
**Déantar** (It is done/One does)
**Rinneadh** (It was done/One did)
**Déanfar** (It will be done/One will do)
**Dhéanfaí** (It would be done/One would do)

Usage:
**Déantar an obair gach lá.** (The work is done every day.)
**Rinneadh botún.** (A mistake was made.)

## Copula constructions

The copula **is** is used in various constructions for emphasis, classification, and identification. Here are some common patterns:

1. Classification:
   **Is múinteoir mé.** (I am a teacher.)

2. Identification:
   **Is é Seán an múinteoir.** (Seán is the teacher.)

3. Emphasis:
   **Is maith liom tae.** (I like tea.)
   **Is breá liom an ceol.** (I love the music.)

4. Comparatives:
   **Is fearr liom caife ná tae.** (I prefer coffee to tea.)

5. Superlatives:
   **Is é an leabhar is fearr é.** (It is the best book.)

## Prepositional pronouns

Irish combines prepositions with pronouns to form a single word. These are called prepositional pronouns. Here are examples with common prepositions:

**ag** (at):
agam (at me), agat (at you), aige (at him), aici (at her), againn (at us), agaibh (at you pl.), acu (at them)

**ar** (on):
orm (on me), ort (on you), air (on him), uirthi (on her), orainn (on us), oraibh (on you pl.), orthu (on them)

**le** (with):
liom (with me), leat (with you), leis (with him), léi (with her), linn (with us), libh (with you pl.), leo (with them)

Usage:
**Tá leabhar agam.** (I have a book.)
**Tá áthas orm.** (I am happy.)
**Tá brón orm.** (I am sorry.)
**Tá sé ag teastáil uaim.** (I need it./It is needed from me.)

## Dependent and independent forms of verbs

Irish verbs have two forms: dependent and independent. The independent form is used when the verb starts a sentence or clause. The dependent form is used after particles like **ní** (not), **an** (question particle), **go** (that), etc.

Examples with the verb **feic** (to see):

Independent: **Feicim** (I see)
Dependent: **Ní fheicim** (I don't see)

Independent: **Chonaic mé** (I saw)
Dependent: **Ní fhaca mé** (I didn't see)

## Verbal particles

Irish uses various particles with verbs to indicate tense, mood, or to form questions and negatives:

1. **do**: past tense marker (often omitted in speech)
   **Do chonaic mé** (I saw)

2. **a**: relative particle
   **an fear a chonaic mé** (the man whom I saw)

3. **go**: that (for reported speech and some subordinate clauses)
   **Dúirt sé go raibh sé tuirseach** (He said that he was tired)

4. **ní**: negative particle
   **Ní thuigim** (I don't understand)

5. **an**: question particle
   **An dtuigeann tú?** (Do you understand?)

6. **nár**: negative question particle (past tense)
   **Nár ith tú do dhinnéar?** (Didn't you eat your dinner?)

## Adjective comparison

Irish adjectives have three degrees of comparison: positive, comparative, and superlative.

Positive: the basic form of the adjective
**mór** (big), **beag** (small), **deas** (nice)

Comparative: formed by adding **níos** before the comparative form of the adjective
**níos mó** (bigger), **níos lú** (smaller), **níos deise** (nicer)

Superlative: formed by adding **is** before the comparative form of the adjective
**is mó** (biggest), **is lú** (smallest), **is deise** (nicest)

Example in use:
**Tá an teach seo mór.** (This house is big.)
**Tá an teach sin níos mó.** (That house is bigger.)
**Sin é an teach is mó.** (That's the biggest house.)

## Genitive case

The genitive case is used to show possession or association. It's formed by changing the ending of the noun and sometimes by adding internal vowel changes.

Examples:
**mac** (son) → **mic** (of a son)
**cara** (friend) → **carad** (of a friend)
**bád** (boat) → **báid** (of a boat)

Usage:
**mac an fhir** (the man's son)
**doras an tí** (the door of the house)

## Vocative case

The vocative case is used for direct address. It's formed by leniting the initial consonant (if possible) and adding **a** before the noun.

Examples:
**Seán** → **a Sheáin**
**Máire** → **a Mháire**

Usage:
**Dia duit, a Sheáin!** (Hello, Seán!)
**Conas atá tú, a Mháire?** (How are you, Máire?)

## Verbal adjectives

Verbal adjectives are formed from verbs and are used like past participles in English.

Formation: usually by adding -ta, -te, or -tha to the verb stem
**dún** (close) → **dúnta** (closed)
**bris** (break) → **briste** (broken)
**ceannaigh** (buy) → **ceannaithe** (bought)

Usage:
**Tá an doras dúnta.** (The door is closed.)
**Tá an obair críochnaithe.** (The work is finished.)

## Compound prepositions

Irish has many compound prepositions, formed by combining a simple preposition with a noun:

**os comhair** (in front of)
**in aice le** (next to)
**tar éis** (after)
**i measc** (among)

Usage:
**Tá sé ina sheasamh os comhair an tí.** (He is standing in front of the house.)
**Tá an siopa in aice leis an scoil.** (The shop is next to the school.)

## Reflexive pronouns

Reflexive pronouns are formed by adding **féin** after the personal pronoun:

**mé féin** (myself)
**tú féin** (yourself)
**é féin** (himself)
**í féin** (herself)
**sinn féin** (ourselves)
**sibh féin** (yourselves)
**iad féin** (themselves)

Usage:
**Rinne mé é mé féin.** (I did it myself.)

## Demonstratives

Irish has three demonstrative pronouns:

**seo** (this)
**sin** (that)
**siúd** (that over there)

Usage:
**an fear seo** (this man)
**an bhean sin** (that woman)
**an teach siúd** (that house over there)

## Stative expressions

Irish often uses prepositional pronouns to express states or conditions:

**Tá áthas orm.** (I am happy. Lit: Happiness is on me.)
**Tá ocras air.** (He is hungry. Lit: Hunger is on him.)
**Tá eagla uirthi.** (She is afraid. Lit: Fear is on her.)
**Tá airgead ag teastáil uaim.** (I need money. Lit: Money is needed from me.)

## Aspect and Aktionsart

Irish has a rich system of expressing different aspects of actions:

1. Habitual present: 
   **Ithim arán gach lá.** (I eat bread every day.)

2. Present continuous:
   **Tá mé ag ithe aráin anois.** (I am eating bread now.)

3. Perfect:
   **Tá an obair déanta agam.** (I have done the work.)

4. Prospective:
   **Tá mé chun imeacht.** (I am about to leave.)

5. After perfect:
   **Tá mé tar éis an leabhar a léamh.** (I have just read the book.)

## Conjunctions and subordinate clauses

Irish uses various conjunctions to form complex sentences:

**agus** (and): **Bhí sé fuar agus fliuch.** (It was cold and wet.)

**ach** (but): **Is maith liom tae ach is fearr liom caife.** (I like tea but I prefer coffee.)

**mar** (because): **D'fhan mé sa bhaile mar bhí mé tinn.** (I stayed at home because I was sick.)

**nuair** (when): **Nuair a bheidh mé réidh, rachaidh mé amach.** (When I'm ready, I'll go out.)

**má** (if): **Má bhíonn an aimsir go maith, rachaimid go dtí an trá.** (If the weather is good, we'll go to the beach.)
