# Yoruba

Yoruba is a Niger-Congo language spoken by approximately 30 million people, primarily in southwestern Nigeria and parts of Benin and Togo. It is one of the most widely spoken languages in Africa and has significant influence in the African diaspora, particularly in the Americas. Yoruba is known for its rich tonal system, complex verbal structures, and extensive use of idiomatic expressions.

## Phonology

### Vowels

Yoruba has a seven-vowel system for oral vowels and a five-vowel system for nasal vowels:

Oral vowels:
| Vowel | IPA | Description | Example |
|-------|-----|-------------|---------|
| i | [i] | Close front unrounded | **igi** [igi] "tree" |
| e | [e] | Close-mid front unrounded | **epo** [epo] "oil" |
| ẹ | [ɛ] | Open-mid front unrounded | **ẹkọ** [ɛkɔ] "lesson" |
| a | [a] | Open central unrounded | **ata** [ata] "pepper" |
| ọ | [ɔ] | Open-mid back rounded | **ọjọ́** [ɔdʒɔ́] "day" |
| o | [o] | Close-mid back rounded | **oko** [oko] "farm" |
| u | [u] | Close back rounded | **eku** [eku] "rat" |

Nasal vowels:
| Vowel | IPA | Description | Example |
|-------|-----|-------------|---------|
| in | [ĩ] | Nasalized close front unrounded | **inú** [ĩnú] "stomach" |
| ẹn | [ɛ̃] | Nasalized open-mid front unrounded | **ẹn** [ɛ̃] "mat" |
| an | [ã] | Nasalized open central unrounded | **àn** [ã] "to measure" |
| ọn | [ɔ̃] | Nasalized open-mid back rounded | **ọn** [ɔ̃] "to sprinkle" |
| un | [ũ] | Nasalized close back rounded | **un** [ũ] "to pound" |

Vowel harmony is a significant feature in Yoruba. The vowels are divided into two sets:

Set 1: i, e, ọ, u
Set 2: i, ẹ, a, ọ, u

Words generally contain vowels from only one set, with some exceptions for compound words and loanwords.

Example of vowel harmony:
- **dídé** [dídé] "to stand up" (Set 1)
- **dàdà** [dàdà] "immediately" (Set 2)

### Consonants

Yoruba has 18 consonant phonemes:

| Consonant | IPA | Description | Example |
|-----------|-----|-------------|---------|
| b | [b] | Voiced bilabial plosive | **bàbá** [bàbá] "father" |
| d | [d] | Voiced alveolar plosive | **dúdú** [dúdú] "black" |
| f | [f] | Voiceless labiodental fricative | **fún** [fũ] "to give" |
| g | [ɡ] | Voiced velar plosive | **gìgì** [ɡìɡì] "spectacles" |
| gb | [ɡ͡b] | Voiced labial-velar plosive | **gbogbo** [ɡ͡boɡ͡bo] "all" |
| h | [h] | Voiceless glottal fricative | **hó** [hó] "to boil" |
| j | [dʒ] | Voiced palato-alveolar affricate | **jẹ** [dʒɛ] "to eat" |
| k | [k] | Voiceless velar plosive | **kí** [kí] "to greet" |
| l | [l] | Alveolar lateral approximant | **lọ** [lɔ] "to go" |
| m | [m] | Bilabial nasal | **mu** [mu] "to drink" |
| n | [n] | Alveolar nasal | **ní** [ní] "to have" |
| p | [kp] | Voiceless labial-velar plosive | **pé** [kpé] "to call" |
| r | [r] | Alveolar trill | **rí** [rí] "to see" |
| s | [s] | Voiceless alveolar fricative | **sùn** [sũ] "to sleep" |
| ṣ | [ʃ] | Voiceless palato-alveolar fricative | **ṣe** [ʃe] "to do" |
| t | [t] | Voiceless alveolar plosive | **ta** [ta] "to sell" |
| w | [w] | Labial-velar approximant | **wá** [wá] "to come" |
| y | [j] | Palatal approximant | **yẹ** [jɛ] "to be fit" |

Some notable features of Yoruba consonants:

1. The labial-velar consonants [ɡ͡b] and [kp] are single phonemes, not consonant clusters.
2. The sound [r] is typically realized as a tap [ɾ] in rapid speech.
3. The consonant [h] is often elided in casual speech, especially between vowels.

### Tones

Yoruba is a tonal language with three phonemic tones:

1. High tone (´): e.g., **á**
2. Mid tone (unmarked): e.g., a
3. Low tone (`): e.g., **à**

These tones are essential for distinguishing meaning:

- **ọwọ́** [ɔwɔ́] "hand"
- **ọwọ** [ɔwɔ] "broom"
- **ọwọ̀** [ɔwɔ̀] "respect"

Contour tones also exist, typically resulting from the combination of level tones:

- Rising tone (ˇ): low to high
- Falling tone (ˆ): high to low

Examples:
- **ọkọ̌** [ɔkɔ̌] "hoe" (rising tone)
- **ộ** [ɔ̂] "he/she" (emphatic, falling tone)

Tonal patterns play a crucial role in Yoruba grammar, affecting various aspects of the language:

1. Lexical distinctions: As shown above, tones can differentiate words that are otherwise identical.

2. Grammatical functions: Tones can indicate grammatical categories or functions.
   Example: **rí** (to see) vs. **rì** (perfective aspect marker)

3. Tonal changes in context: Tones can change based on their position in a phrase or sentence.
   Example: **mo rí i** ("I saw it") becomes **mó rí i** in fast speech, with the tone of "mo" changing from mid to high.

4. Downdrift: In a sequence of high and low tones, each subsequent high tone is slightly lower than the previous one.
   Example: **ó bẹ́ ọmọ rẹ̀** [ó bɛ́ ɔmɔ rɛ̀] "He/She cut his/her child"
   The high tone on **bẹ́** is slightly lower than the one on **ó**.

5. Downstep: A high tone following a mid tone is realized at a lower pitch than a normal high tone.
   Example: **mo rí ẹran** [mo rí ꜜɛran] "I saw meat"
   The high tone on **ẹ́** in **ẹran** is lower than the high tone on **rí**.

### Syllable structure

The most common syllable structure in Yoruba is CV (consonant-vowel), but V (vowel-only) syllables are also possible. Yoruba does not allow consonant clusters or closed syllables.

Examples:
- **ọmọ** [ɔ.mɔ] "child" (CV.CV)
- **aiye** [a.i.je] "world" (V.V.CV)
- **òròmọ** [ò.rò.mɔ] "calf" (V.CV.CV)

The syllable structure plays a role in various phonological processes:

1. Elision: When two vowels meet across word boundaries, one may be elided.
   Example: **mo ò rí i** → **mò ó rí i** "I didn't see it"

2. Assimilation: Vowels may assimilate to neighboring sounds.
   Example: **omi** + **inu** → **ominú** "water inside"

3. Tone spreading: Tones can spread across syllable boundaries in certain contexts.
   Example: **olú** + **ọmọ** → **olúọ́mọ́** "firstborn child"

## Orthography

Yoruba uses the Latin alphabet with some modifications. The standard orthography includes the following letters:

A B D E Ẹ F G GB H I J K L M N O Ọ P R S Ṣ T U W Y

The letters C, Q, V, X, and Z are not used in native Yoruba words but may appear in loanwords.

Diacritical marks are used to indicate tones and distinguish between open and close vowels:

- Acute accent (´) for high tone
- Grave accent (`) for low tone
- Subdot (.) for open vowels (ẹ and ọ)

Examples:
- **ọkọ̀** "husband"
- **ọkọ́** "vehicle"
- **ẹkọ** "lesson"

Some additional orthographic conventions:

1. The mid tone is usually left unmarked, but in some educational materials, it may be marked with a macron (¯).

2. Nasalized vowels are written with an 'n' following the vowel: **an**, **ẹn**, **in**, **ọn**, **un**.

3. The labial-velar consonants are written as digraphs: **gb** for [ɡ͡b] and **p** for [kp].

4. The palato-alveolar fricative [ʃ] is written as **ṣ** with a subdot.

5. Long vowels are written as two identical vowels: **òòrùn** "sun".

6. In some older texts or regional variations, you may encounter different orthographic conventions, such as:
   - **sh** instead of **ṣ**
   - **ch** instead of **tš**
   - **kp** instead of **p**

## Morphology

### Nouns

Yoruba nouns do not inflect for number, gender, or case. Plurality is typically expressed through context or by using number words.

Example:
- **ọmọ** can mean "child" or "children" depending on context
- **ọmọ mẹ́ta** "three children" (literally "child three")

#### Compound nouns

Yoruba frequently forms compound nouns by combining two or more words:

- **ilé** "house" + **ìwé** "book" = **ilé-ìwé** "school"
- **ọmọ** "child" + **ọkùnrin** "male" = **ọmọkùnrin** "boy"
- **ẹ̀kọ́** "lesson" + **ìṣirò** "calculation" = **ẹ̀kọ́-ìṣirò** "mathematics"
- **àgbà** "elder" + **ìjọba** "government" = **àgbàjọba** "cabinet minister"

#### Nominal prefixes

Yoruba uses various prefixes to derive nouns from verbs or other nouns:

1. **a-/ẹ-**: forms agentive nouns
   - **kọ** "to write" → **akọ̀wé** "writer"
   - **jẹ** "to eat" → **ajẹun** "eater"

2. **o-/ọ-**: forms nouns describing a state or condition
   - **dára** "to be good" → **odára** "goodness"
   - **ṣe** "to do" → **oṣìṣẹ́** "worker"

3. **ì-**: forms abstract nouns or nouns of action
   - **kọ́** "to learn" → **ìkọ́** "learning"
   - **fẹ́** "to love" → **ìfẹ́** "love"

4. **àì-**: forms negative nouns
   - **mọ̀** "to know" → **àìmọ̀** "ignorance"
   - **gbọ́** "to hear" → **àìgbọ́** "deafness"

#### Reduplication

Nouns can be reduplicated to express intensity, plurality, or distribution:

- **ọjọ́** "day" → **ọjọọ́jọ́** "every day"
- **ìgbà** "time" → **ìgbàgbà** "sometimes"

### Pronouns

Yoruba pronouns distinguish between singular and plural forms, as well as between human and non-human referents in the third person.

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | **èmi** / **mo** | **àwa** / **a** |
| 2nd    | **ìwọ** / **o** | **ẹ̀yin** / **ẹ** |
| 3rd (human) | **òun** / **ó** | **àwọn** / **wọ́n** |
| 3rd (non-human) | **ó** | **wọ́n** |

Examples:
- **Mo rí ẹ.** "I see you."
- **Ó ń sùn.** "He/She is sleeping." or "It is sleeping."

Additional pronoun types:

1. Possessive pronouns:
   - **ti**
   Example: **ti mo** "mine", **ti wa** "ours"

2. Emphatic pronouns:
   - Add **tikarami** (singular) or **tikaraẹni** (plural)
   Example: **Èmi tikarami** "I myself", **Àwa tikaraẹni** "We ourselves"

3. Reflexive pronouns:
   - Use **ara** "body" + possessive
   Example: **ara mi** "myself", **ara rẹ** "yourself"

4. Reciprocal pronoun:
   - **ara wọn** "each other"
   Example: **Wọ́n fẹ́ràn ara wọn.** "They love each other."

5. Indefinite pronouns:
   - **ẹnìkan** "someone"
   - **ohunkóhun** "anything"
   - **ibìkíbi** "anywhere"

### Verbs

Yoruba verbs do not conjugate for person, number, or gender. Tense, aspect, and mood are expressed through particles and auxiliaries.

#### Tense and Aspect

1. Present/Habitual: unmarked
   **Mo jẹun.** "I eat." / "I am eating."

2. Past: use of **ti**
   **Mo ti jẹun.** "I have eaten."

3. Future: use of **yóò** or **á**
   **Mo yóò jẹun.** / **Má jẹun.** "I will eat."

4. Progressive: use of **ń**
   **Mo ń jẹun.** "I am eating."

5. Perfective: use of **ti**
   **Mo ti jẹun tán.** "I have finished eating."

6. Habitual past: use of **máa ń**
   **Mo máa ń jẹun ní àsìkò yìí.** "I used to eat at this time."

7. Continuous: use of **ń ... lọ**
   **Mo ń ṣiṣẹ́ lọ.** "I am continuing to work."

#### Negation

Verbs are negated using various particles depending on the tense and aspect:

1. Simple negation: **kò** (or its variants **kì í**, **kó**)
   **Mo jẹun.** "I eat." → **Èmi kò jẹun.** "I don't eat."

2. Progressive negation: **kò ń**
   **Mo ń jẹun.** "I am eating." → **Èmi kò ń jẹun.** "I am not eating."

3. Future negation: **kò ní**
   **Má jẹun.** "I will eat." → **Èmi kò ní jẹun.** "I will not eat."

4. Perfective negation: **kò tí ì**
   **Mo ti jẹun.** "I have eaten." → **Èmi kò tí ì jẹun.** "I have not eaten."

#### Imperative

The imperative mood in Yoruba is formed in several ways:

1. Simple imperative: use the bare verb form
   **Jẹun!** "Eat!"

2. Polite imperative: add **jọ̀wọ́**
   **Jọ̀wọ́ jẹun.** "Please eat."

3. Negative imperative: use **má ṣe**
   **Má ṣe jẹun.** "Don't eat."

4. Plural imperative: add **ẹ**
   **Ẹ jẹun!** "Eat!" (addressing multiple people)

#### Serial Verb Constructions

Yoruba makes extensive use of serial verb constructions, where multiple verbs are used in sequence without conjunctions:

**Mo mú ọbẹ jẹ.**
I take soup eat
"I ate soup."

**Ó sáré wá ilé.**
He/She run come house
"He/She ran home."

#### Verb Nominalization

Verbs can be nominalized in Yoruba using the prefix **ì-** or **à-**:

- **kọ́** "to write" → **ìkọ́wé** "writing"
- **gbọ́** "to hear" → **ìgbọ́** "hearing"
- **bẹ̀rẹ̀** "to begin" → **ìbẹ̀rẹ̀** "beginning"
- **dá** "to create" → **àdá** "creation"

### Adjectives

Yoruba adjectives typically follow the nouns they modify:

- **aṣọ dúdú** "black cloth"
- **ọmọ kékeré** "small child"
- **ilé ńlá** "big house"

Some adjectives can be reduplicated for emphasis:

- **dúdú** "black" → **dúdúdú** "very black"
- **kékeré** "small" → **kékèké** "very small"

Adjectives can also be derived from verbs:

- **dára** "to be good" → **dáradára** "good"
- **ga** "to be tall" → **gíga** "tall"

### Adverbs

Many adverbs in Yoruba are formed by reduplication of adjectives or verbs:

- **dídùn** "sweet" → **dídùndídùn** "sweetly"
- **fẹ́** "to be quick" → **fẹ́fẹ́** "quickly"
- **jẹ́jẹ́** "gently"
- **díẹ̀díẹ̀** "little by little"

Adverbs typically occur at the end of a clause:

**Ó ń sáré fẹ́fẹ́.**
He/She PROG run quickly
"He/She is running quickly."

Some adverbs are formed using the prefix **ní-**:

- **ọ̀pọ̀lọpọ̀** "plenty" → **lọ́pọ̀lọpọ̀** "plentifully"
- **àìmọ̀** "ignorance" → **láìmọ̀** "ignorantly"

### Prepositions

Yoruba has a limited number of true prepositions, but uses many noun-like words to express spatial and temporal relationships:

1. True prepositions:
   - **ní** "in, at, on"
   - **sí** "to, towards"
   - **fún** "for"
   - **pẹ̀lú** "with"

2. Noun-like words used as prepositions:
   - **inú** "inside"
   - **orí** "on top of"
   - **ẹ̀hìn** "behind"
   - **iwájú** "in front of"
   - **ẹ̀gbẹ́** "beside"

Examples:
- **ní ilé** "in the house"
- **sí ọjà** "to the market"
- **fún ìyá mi** "for my mother"
- **pẹ̀lú ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀** "with his/her friend"
- **inú àpótí** "inside the box"
- **lórí tábìlì** "on the table" (ní + orí → lórí)

## Syntax

### Basic Word Order

The basic word order in Yoruba is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):

**Adé ra bàtà.**
Ade buy shoe
"Ade bought shoes."

**Ọmọ náà ń kọ ìwé.**
Child the PROG write book
"The child is writing a book."

### Question Formation

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the particle **ṣé** at the beginning of a statement:

- Statement: **O ti jẹun.** "You have eaten."
- Question: **Ṣé o ti jẹun?** "Have you eaten?"

Wh-questions use question words in situ (in their normal position):

**O rí ta?**
You see who
"Who did you see?"

**Ó lọ sí ibo?**
He/She go to where
"Where did he/she go?"

Common question words:
- **ta** "who"
- **kí** "what"
- **ibo** / **níbo** "where"
- **nígbà wo** "when"
- **báwo** "how"
- **èéṣe** "why"
- **mélòó** "how many"

### Focus and Topicalization

Yoruba uses the focus marker **ni** to emphasize particular elements in a sentence:

**Adé ni ó ra bàtà.**
Ade FOC he buy shoe
"It was Ade who bought shoes."

**Lánàá ni mo dé.**
Yesterday FOC I arrive
"It was yesterday that I arrived."

Topicalization is achieved by fronting the topicalized element and often using a resumptive pronoun:

**Bàtà, Adé ra wọ́n.**
Shoe, Ade buy them
"As for shoes, Ade bought them."

**Ilé yìí, mo fẹ́ràn rẹ̀.**
House this, I like it
"This house, I like it."

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Yoruba are introduced by the relative marker **tí** and follow the noun they modify:

**Ọkùnrin tí mo rí lánàá wá.**
Man that I see yesterday come
"The man that I saw yesterday came."

**Ìwé tí mo ra dára.**
Book that I buy good
"The book that I bought is good."

### Comparison

Comparatives are formed using the verb **ju** ("to surpass") and the preposition **lọ** ("to go"):

**Adé ga ju Òjó lọ.**
Ade tall surpass Ojo go
"Ade is taller than Ojo."

**Ilé yìí tóbi ju èyí lọ.**
House this big surpass that go
"This house is bigger than that one."

Superlatives use **jù lọ** ("surpass all"):

**Adé ga jù lọ.**
Ade tall surpass all
"Ade is the tallest."

**Èyí dára jù lọ.**
This good surpass all
"This is the best."

### Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences in Yoruba typically use the particle **bí** ("if") or **tí** ("if/when"):

**Bí ojú ọjọ́ bá dára, a ó lọ sí etí òkun.**
If eye day if good, we FUT go to edge ocean
"If the weather is good, we will go to the beach."

**Tí o bá fẹ́, o lè wá.**
If you if want, you can come
"If you want, you can come."

### Coordination

Coordination in Yoruba is achieved using conjunctions such as:

- **àti** "and"
- **tàbí** "or"
- **ṣùgbọ́n** "but"
- **nítorí** "because"

Examples:
**Mo ra ìwé àti bírò.**
I buy book and pen
"I bought a book and a pen."

**Ṣé o fẹ́ oúnjẹ tàbí omi?**
Q you want food or water
"Do you want food or water?"

**Mo fẹ́ lọ, ṣùgbọ́n kò sí àsìkò.**
I want go, but NEG exist time
"I want to go, but there's no time."

## Idiomatic Expressions and Proverbs

Yoruba is rich in idiomatic expressions and proverbs, which are often used to convey wisdom, cultural values, or complex ideas succinctly. Here are some examples:

1. **Ọwọ́ ọmọdé kò tó pẹpẹ, ti àgbàlagbà kò wọ kèrègbè.**
   "A child's hand cannot reach the shelf, an elder's hand cannot enter a gourd."
   (Everyone has their limitations.)

2. **Bí ọ́kọ̀ bá ṣubú, á yọ́ ìyà; bí ènìyàn bá ṣubú, á yọ́ ẹ̀sìn.**
   "If a vehicle breaks down, it brings out suffering; if a person falls, it brings out mockery."
   (People are quick to mock others' misfortunes.)

3. **Ọgbọ́n ọdún kọ́ ni festival.**
   "Thirty years is not a festival."
   (Experience is valuable and takes time to acquire.)

4. **Àgbà kò sí ní ìlú, ilú bàjẹ́; baálẹ̀ ìlú kú, ìlú di ahoro.**
   "When there are no elders in town, the town is ruined; when the town's leader dies, the town becomes desolate."
   (The importance of leadership and wisdom in a community.)

5. **Ọ̀rọ̀ ọmọdé kò ní ojú, ọ̀rọ̀ àgbà kò ní ẹ̀hìn.**
   "A child's words have no front, an elder's words have no back."
   (Children speak without foresight, while elders' words have deep meaning.)

6. **Bí a bá ń sọ̀rọ̀ ọba, à ń sọ̀rọ̀ ara ẹni.**
   "When we talk about the king, we are talking about ourselves."
   (Our words about others reflect on us.)

7. **Ẹni tó bá dúpẹ́ fún oúnjẹ àná, yóò rí ọ̀tún jẹ.**
   "Whoever gives thanks for yesterday's meal will find another to eat."
   (Gratitude leads to more blessings.)

These proverbs and idiomatic expressions play a significant role in Yoruba communication, often used to add depth, wisdom, or humor to conversations.

## Numbers and Counting System

Yoruba has a vigesimal (base-20) number system, which is quite different from the decimal system used in many languages. Here's an overview of the Yoruba numbering system:

1-10:
- 1: **ọ̀kan**
- 2: **èjì**
- 3: **ẹ̀ta**
- 4: **ẹ̀rin**
- 5: **àrún**
- 6: **ẹ̀fà**
- 7: **èje**
- 8: **ẹ̀jọ**
- 9: **ẹ̀sán**
- 10: **ẹ̀wá**

11-19 are formed by adding **lá** ("on top") to the units:
- 11: **ọ̀kànlá**
- 12: **èjìlá**
- 13: **ẹ̀tàlá**
- ...
- 19: **ọ̀kàndínlógún** (literally "one less than twenty")

20 and above:
- 20: **ogún**
- 30: **ọgbọ̀n**
- 40: **ogójì**
- 50: **àádọ́ta** (60 minus 10)
- 60: **ọgọ́ta**
- 70: **àádọ́rin** (80 minus 10)
- 80: **ọgọ́rin**
- 90: **àádọ́rùn-ún** (100 minus 10)
- 100: **ọgọ́rùn-ún**
- 200: **igba**
- 400: **irinwó**

Large numbers:
- 1,000: **ẹgbẹ̀rún**
- 2,000: **ẹgbàá**
- 20,000: **ọ̀kẹ́**

Examples of complex numbers:
- 25: **àrún-ún lé nì ógún** (5 on top of 20)
- 78: **ẹẹ́jọ lé ní àádọ́rin** (8 on top of 70)
- 365: **ọ̀ọ́dúnrún ó lé márùn-ún** (300 + 60 + 5)

The Yoruba counting system can be challenging for learners, but it reflects the cultural and historical importance of the number 20 in Yoruba society.

## Loanwords and Modern Vocabulary

Like many languages, Yoruba has incorporated loanwords to express modern concepts, particularly from English due to Nigeria's colonial history.
