# Silesian

Silesian (endonym: **ślōnskŏ gŏdka** or **ślůnsko godka**) is a West Slavic language or dialect continuum spoken primarily in the historical region of Silesia, which is now divided between southwestern Poland, the Czech Republic, and Germany. The status of Silesian as a separate language or a dialect of Polish is debated among linguists and sociolinguists. For the purposes of this overview, we will treat it as a distinct language while acknowledging its close relationship to Polish.

Silesian is spoken by approximately 500,000 to 850,000 people, mainly in the Upper Silesia region of Poland. It has been influenced by German, Czech, and Polish throughout its history, resulting in a unique linguistic character.

## Phonology

### Vowels

Silesian has a rich vowel system, including both oral and nasal vowels. The exact number and quality of vowels can vary between dialects.

| IPA | Silesian Orthography | Example |
|-----|----------------------|---------|
| /a/ | a | **mama** (mother) |
| /ɛ/ | e | **cera** (daughter) |
| /i/ | i | **pić** (to drink) |
| /ɨ/ | y | **synek** (son) |
| /ɔ/ | o | **kocur** (cat) |
| /u/ | u | **kuń** (horse) |
| /ɘ/ | ô | **kôń** (horse, in some dialects) |
| /ɵ/ | ō | **pōdziesz** (you will go) |

Nasal vowels:

| IPA | Silesian Orthography | Example |
|-----|----------------------|---------|
| /ɔ̃/ | ą | **gąsior** (gander) |
| /ɛ̃/ | ę | **węgiel** (coal) |

### Consonants

Silesian consonants are similar to those in Polish, with some notable differences:

| /j/ | j | **jajco** (egg) |
| /w/ | ł | **łōńka** (meadow) |

### Phonological processes

1. Vowel nasalization: Similar to Polish, Silesian has vowel nasalization before nasal consonants.
   Example: **kąsek** [kɔ̃sɛk] (piece)

2. Final devoicing: Voiced obstruents are devoiced at the end of words.
   Example: **chlyb** [xlɨp] (bread)

3. Voicing assimilation: Consonants assimilate in voicing to the following consonant.
   Example: **ôczko** [ɔtʂkɔ] (little eye)

4. Palatalization: Consonants can be palatalized before front vowels.
   Example: **kiery** [cɛrɨ] (which)

### Stress

Stress in Silesian is typically on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable, similar to Polish.
Example: **ro-bo-**ta (work)

## Morphology

Silesian, like other Slavic languages, has a rich inflectional morphology for nouns, adjectives, and verbs.

### Nouns

Silesian nouns have three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural), and seven cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, vocative).

Example declension for **chłop** (man):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | chłop | chłopi |
| Accusative | chłopa | chłopōw |
| Genitive | chłopa | chłopōw |
| Dative | chłopowi | chłopōm |
| Instrumental | chłopym | chłopami |
| Locative | chłopie | chłopach |
| Vocative | chłopie | chłopi |

### Adjectives

Adjectives agree with nouns in gender, number, and case. They typically precede the noun they modify.

Example declension for **dobry** (good):

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | dobry | dobrŏ | dobre |
| Accusative | dobrego/dobry | dobrõ | dobre |
| Genitive | dobrego | dobryj | dobrego |
| Dative | dobrymu | dobryj | dobremu |
| Instrumental | dobrym | dobrõ | dobrym |
| Locative | dobrym | dobryj | dobrym |
| Vocative | dobry | dobrŏ | dobre |

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Silesian:

| Person | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive |
|--------|------------|------------|----------|
| 1sg | jŏ | mie | mie |
| 2sg | ty | cie | cie |
| 3sg.m | ōn | go | jego/niego |
| 3sg.f | ōna | jõ | ji/nij |
| 3sg.n | ōno | je | jego/niego |
| 1pl | my | nos | nos |
| 2pl | wy | wos | wos |
| 3pl | ōni/ōny | ich | ich/nich |

### Verbs

Silesian verbs conjugate for person, number, tense, mood, and aspect. The aspectual system, similar to other Slavic languages, distinguishes between perfective and imperfective verbs.

Example conjugation of **robić** (to do, imperfective) in present tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | robia | robimy |
| 2nd | robisz | robicie |
| 3rd | robi | robiōm |

Past tense forms are created using the **-ł** suffix and vary by gender in the singular:

| Person | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1sg | robiłech | robiłach | - |
| 2sg | robiłeś | robiłaś | - |
| 3sg | robił | robiła | robiło |
| 1pl | robilim | robiłymy | - |
| 2pl | robiliście | robiłyście | - |
| 3pl | robili | robiły | - |

Future tense for imperfective verbs is formed analytically, using the future forms of **być** (to be) and the infinitive or past form of the main verb:

**bda robić** or **bda robił/robiła** (I will do)

Perfective verbs use present tense forms to express future meaning:

**zrobia** (I will do, completed action)

### Aspect

Silesian, like other Slavic languages, has a developed aspectual system. Most verbs come in perfective-imperfective pairs. 

Examples:
- **robić** (to do, imperfective) / **zrobić** (to do, perfective)
- **pisać** (to write, imperfective) / **napisać** (to write, perfective)
- **czytać** (to read, imperfective) / **przeczytać** (to read, perfective)

### Numerals

Cardinal numbers in Silesian:

1 - **jedyn** (m), **jedna** (f), **jedno** (n)
2 - **dwa** (m/n), **dwie** (f)
3 - **trzi**
4 - **sztyrzi**
5 - **piynć**
10 - **dziesiyńć**
20 - **dwadzieścia**
100 - **sto**
1000 - **tysiōnc**

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding adjectival endings to the cardinal number stems:

1st - **piyrszy**
2nd - **drugi**
3rd - **trzeci**
4th - **sztworty**
5th - **piōnty**

## Syntax

### Word Order

Silesian generally follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, but like other Slavic languages, it allows for considerable flexibility due to its case system.

Basic order: **Jŏ widza psa.** (I see a dog.)
Emphatic order: **Psa jŏ widza.** (It's a dog that I see.)

### Negation

Negation is formed by adding the particle **nie** before the verb:

**Jŏ nie widza psa.** (I don't see a dog.)

In past tense constructions, **nie** comes before the auxiliary:

**Jŏ żech nie widzioł psa.** (I didn't see a dog.)

### Questions

Yes-no questions can be formed simply by intonation:

Statement: **Ōn je w dōma.** (He is at home.)
Question: **Ōn je w dōma?** (Is he at home?)

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns at the beginning of the sentence:

**Kto to je?** (Who is it?)
**Co ty robiysz?** (What are you doing?)
**Kaj ōn miyszkŏ?** (Where does he live?)

### Comparison

Comparatives are formed by adding **-szy** or **-ejszy** to the adjective stem:

**dobry** (good) → **lepszy** (better)
**wysoki** (tall) → **wyższy** (taller)
**ciepły** (warm) → **cieplejszy** (warmer)

Superlatives are formed by adding the prefix **nŏj-** to the comparative form:

**nŏjlepszy** (best)
**nŏjwyższy** (tallest)
**nŏjcieplejszy** (warmest)

### Conditional

The conditional mood is formed using the particle **by** and past tense forms:

**Jŏ by to zrobił.** (I would do it.)
**Ōna by prziszła, jakby miała czas.** (She would come if she had time.)

## Lexicon

Silesian vocabulary shows influences from various languages, particularly German, Czech, and Polish. Here are some examples of Silesian words with their origins:

1. Silesian words of Slavic origin:
   **woda** (water)
   **matka** (mother)
   **śniŏdanie** (breakfast)

2. German loanwords:
   **ancug** (suit, from German "Anzug")
   **familok** (tenement house, from German "Familienhaus")
   **szrank** (wardrobe, from German "Schrank")

3. Czech influences:
   **dźwiyrze** (door, compare Czech "dveře")
   **prŏca** (work, compare Czech "práce")

4. Unique Silesian words:
   **gŏdać** (to speak)
   **bajtel** (child)
   **karminadle** (meatballs)

## Dialects

Silesian exhibits significant dialectal variation. Some of the main dialect groups include:

1. Opole dialect
2. Cieszyn Silesia dialect
3. Upper Silesian dialect
4. Jabłonków dialect

These dialects can differ in pronunciation, vocabulary, and some grammatical features. For example, the word for "now" can be **terŏz**, **teraz**, or **terozki** depending on the dialect.

## Phonological differences from Polish

Silesian has several distinctive phonological features that set it apart from standard Polish:

1. Retention of the vowel /ɘ/ (written as ô), which merged with /u/ in standard Polish:
   Silesian: **kôń** [kɘɲ], Polish: **koń** [kɔɲ] (horse)

2. Different realization of nasal vowels:
   Silesian often has [ɔn], [ɛn] where Polish has [ɔ̃], [ɛ̃]
   Silesian: **dōmb** [dɔmp], Polish: **dąb** [dɔmp] (oak)

3. Lack of palatalization in some contexts:
   Silesian: **śnieg** [ɕɲɛk], Polish: **śnieg** [ɕɲɛɡʲ] (snow)

4. Different stress patterns in some words:
   Silesian: **mu**zyka, Polish: mu**zy**ka (music)

## Grammatical differences from Polish

While Silesian grammar is similar to Polish in many respects, there are some notable differences:

1. Use of the auxiliary **żech/żeś** in past tense constructions:
   Silesian: **Jŏ żech widzioł.** Polish: **Widziałem.** (I saw.)

2. Different endings in some verb conjugations:
   Silesian: **robiōm** (they do), Polish: **robią**

3. Retention of the plural ending **-owie** in more contexts:
   Silesian: **synowie** (sons), Polish: **synowie** (used less frequently)

4. Different case endings in some declensions:
   Silesian: **bez bratōw**, Polish: **bez braci** (without brothers)

5. More extensive use of the genitive of negation:
   Silesian: **Ni mōm czasu.** Polish: **Nie mam czasu.** (I don't have time.)

## Writing system

Silesian does not have a standardized orthography, and various writing systems have been proposed and used. The most common approach is to use a modified Polish alphabet with additional letters to represent Silesian-specific sounds. Here's an example of a commonly used Silesian alphabet:

A, Ā, B, C, Ć, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Ł, M, N, Ń, O, Ō, Ô, P, R, S, Ś, T, U, W, Y, Z, Ź, Ż

The additional letters represent:

- **Ā/ā** - long a sound
- **Ō/ō** - long o sound
- **Ô/ô** - close-mid central rounded vowel [ɘ]

Some writers also use:

- **Ŏ/ŏ** - for a short o sound
- **Õ/õ** - for a nasalized o sound

Some orthographic systems also use diacritics to mark stress in words where it differs from the standard penultimate stress, e.g., **mùzyka**.

It's important to note that due to the lack of standardization, you may encounter variations in spelling across different Silesian texts or authors.

## Sentence structure

Silesian sentence structure is generally similar to Polish, with some notable differences:

1. Subject pronoun dropping:
   Like Polish, Silesian allows for subject pronouns to be omitted when they can be inferred from context:
   **Ida do dōmu.** (I'm going home.)

2. Clitic placement:
   Silesian often places clitics (short, unstressed words) in different positions compared to Polish:
   Silesian: **Jŏ żech to widzioł.** 
   Polish: **Widziałem to.** (I saw it.)

3. Question formation:
   Questions can be formed simply by intonation, without changing word order:
   Statement: **Ōn je głodny.** (He is hungry.)
   Question: **Ōn je głodny?** (Is he hungry?)

4. Topicalization:
   Silesian allows for flexible word order to emphasize different parts of the sentence:
   **Do sklepu jŏ ida.** (It's to the store that I'm going.)

## Verbal aspect

Like other Slavic languages, Silesian has a complex system of verbal aspect. Most verbs come in perfective-imperfective pairs:

1. Imperfective: describes ongoing, habitual, or repeated actions
   **Jŏ pisza list.** (I am writing a letter. / I write letters.)

2. Perfective: describes completed actions or actions viewed as a whole
   **Jŏ napisa list.** (I will write a letter. / I will have written a letter.)

Aspect can be changed through various means:

1. Prefixation: adding a prefix to an imperfective verb often makes it perfective
   **pisać** (to write, impf.) → **napisać** (to write, pf.)

2. Suffixation: changing the suffix can alter the aspect
   **kupić** (to buy, pf.) → **kupować** (to buy, impf.)

3. Suppletion: some verbs use completely different roots for different aspects
   **brać** (to take, impf.) → **wziōńć** (to take, pf.)

## Tense system

Silesian has a tense system similar to other Slavic languages:

1. Present tense:
   **Jŏ czytōm książka.** (I am reading a book.)

2. Past tense:
   **Jŏ żech czytŏł książka.** (I read/was reading a book.)

3. Future tense:
   For imperfective verbs, formed analytically:
   **Jŏ bda czytać książka.** (I will be reading a book.)
   
   For perfective verbs, using present tense forms:
   **Jŏ przeczytōm książka.** (I will read a book.)

4. Pluperfect (past perfect):
   Formed using the past tense of **być** (to be) and the past participle:
   **Jŏ żech był czytŏł książka.** (I had read a book.)

## Modal verbs

Silesian uses modal verbs to express ability, possibility, necessity, etc. Some common modal verbs include:

- **mōc** (can, to be able to)
  **Jŏ moga to zrobić.** (I can do it.)

- **musieć** (must, have to)
  **Ōn musi iść do roboty.** (He must go to work.)

- **chcieć** (want to)
  **Ōni chcōm sie nauczyć ślōnskij gŏdki.** (They want to learn Silesian.)

## Particles and interjections

Silesian has a rich system of particles and interjections that add nuance to speech:

- **ja** / **no** - yes
- **niy** - no
- **coż** - well, so
- **dyć** - indeed, after all
- **przeca** - after all, though
- **isto** - probably, seemingly

Example: **Dyć żech ci to już padŏł!** (I've told you this already, after all!)

## Diminutives and augmentatives

Silesian, like Polish, makes extensive use of diminutives and augmentatives:

Diminutives (expressing smallness or endearment):
- **pies** (dog) → **piesek** (little dog, doggy)
- **książka** (book) → **książeczka** (little book)

Augmentatives (expressing largeness or crudeness):
- **chłop** (man) → **chłopisko** (big man)
- **baba** (woman) → **babsko** (big/crude woman)

Multiple diminutive suffixes can be stacked for increased effect:
**kot** (cat) → **kotek** (kitty) → **koteczek** (little kitty)

## Numbers and counting

Silesian numbers have some unique features:

Cardinal numbers:
1 - **jedyn** (m), **jedna** (f), **jedno** (n)
2 - **dwa** (m/n), **dwie** (f)
3 - **trzi**
4 - **sztyrzi**
5 - **piynć**
...
20 - **dwajścia**
30 - **trzidzieści**
...
100 - **sto**
1000 - **tysiōnc**

Ordinal numbers:
1st - **piyrszy**
2nd - **drugi**
3rd - **trzeci**
...

Collective numbers (used for groups):
**dwoje** (a pair, group of two)
**troje** (a group of three)
**czworo** (a group of four)

When counting with nouns, the form of the noun changes based on the number:

- With 1: nominative singular
  **jedyn pies** (one dog)

- With 2-4: nominative plural
  **trzi psy** (three dogs)

- With 5 and above: genitive plural
  **piynć psōw** (five dogs)

## Idiomatic expressions

Silesian has many idiomatic expressions, some shared with Polish and some unique:

- **Niy dŏj sie** - Don't give up (literally: don't give yourself)
- **Mieć coś na kark** - To have a problem (literally: to have something on one's neck)
- **Robić za lola** - To work for free (literally: to work for a lollipop)
- **Łōny rok** - Last year (literally: that year)
- **Kaj my to som?** - Where are we? (used figuratively to express confusion)

## Code-switching and borrowing

Due to the multilingual nature of Silesia and the close contact with Polish and German, code-switching and borrowing are common phenomena in Silesian speech:

1. German influence:
   **Jŏ musza iść na szicht.** (I have to go to work. "szicht" from German "Schicht" - shift)

2. Polish influence:
   **Ōn mo nowy samochōd.** (He has a new car. "samochōd" is a Polish word)

3. English in modern Silesian:
   **Ōna mo fajny smartphone.** (She has a nice smartphone.)

## Phonosyntactic processes

Silesian exhibits various phonosyntactic processes, including:

1. Voicing assimilation:
   **kot babci** [kɔd bapʨi] (grandmother's cat)

2. Palatalization:
   **w lesie** [v lɛɕɛ] (in the forest)

3. Vowel changes in prefixes:
   **od-** + **iść** → **odyś**ć (to go away)

4. Consonant cluster simplification:
   **miyndzy** [mʲɨnd͡zɨ] (between)

## Pragmatics and politeness

Silesian, like Polish, has a complex system of politeness and formality:

1. T-V distinction: 
   Informal "you": **ty**
   Formal "you": **wy** (singular), **wyście** (plural)

2. Honorifics:
   **pan** (sir), **pani** (madam), **panoczek** (diminutive for sir)

3. Formal verb forms:
   **Kaj pan idzie?** (Where are you going, sir?)

4. Polite phrases:
   **Proszã** - Please
   **Dziynkuja** - Thank you
   **Przepraszōm** - I'm sorry

## Regional variation

Silesian shows considerable regional variation:

1. Opole dialect:
   Tends to be closer to standard Polish in some features
   **jo** instead of **jŏ** for "I"

2. Cieszyn Silesia dialect:
   Influenced by Czech and Slovak
   **ni ma** instead of **niy ma** for "there isn't"

3. Upper Silesian dialect:
   Often considered the "core" Silesian variety
   **Ô** pronunciation is most prominent here

4. Jabłonków dialect:
   Heavily influenced by Polish highland dialects
   Different intonation patterns

These dialects can differ in pronunciation, vocabulary, and even some grammatical features.

## Silesian in the modern world

Despite not having official status, Silesian is used in various domains:

1. Media: Some local radio stations broadcast in Silesian

2. Literature: There's a growing body of literature in Silesian, including translations of world classics

3. Education: Some schools offer optional Silesian language classes

4. Internet: Silesian is used on social media, forums, and there's even a Silesian Wikipedia

5. Music: Many bands and artists perform in Silesian, contributing to its preservation and promotion

However, Silesian faces challenges such as lack of standardization, limited official recognition, and pressure from standard Polish. Efforts are ongoing to preserve and promote the language, with debates about its status (language vs dialect) continuing among linguists and the general public.
