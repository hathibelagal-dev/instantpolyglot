# Fula

Fula, also known as Fulani, Fulfulde, Pulaar, or Pular, is a Senegambian language spoken by the Fula people across West Africa. It belongs to the Atlantic branch of the Niger-Congo language family. Fula is spoken by approximately 40 million people as a first or second language, primarily in countries such as Senegal, Guinea, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Mali.

## Dialects

Fula has numerous dialects, which can be broadly categorized into five main groups:

1. Pulaar (Senegal, Mauritania, western Mali)
2. Pular (Guinea, Sierra Leone)
3. Central (eastern Mali, Burkina Faso, northern Nigeria)
4. Eastern (Chad, Sudan)
5. Adamawa (northern Cameroon, northeastern Nigeria)

While there is significant mutual intelligibility between dialects, there are notable differences in vocabulary, pronunciation, and some grammatical features.

### Dialect Continuum

The Fula dialects form a continuum across West Africa, with neighboring varieties being more mutually intelligible than distant ones. Some key differences include:

1. Phonological variations:
   - Pulaar: Retains /q/ sound, e.g., **qaalis** “money”
   - Central: /q/ becomes /k/, e.g., **kaalis** “money”

2. Lexical differences:
   - Pulaar: **jannde** “to read”
   - Adamawa: **ta'ugo** “to read”

3. Grammatical variations:
   - Pulaar: Uses **-u** for infinitives, e.g., **janngugu** “to read”
   - Central: Uses **-de** for infinitives, e.g., **jannde** “to read”

“Once upon a time, there was an old woman who owned many cows. One day, she went to the bush to graze her cows. There, she found a very beautiful cow. It had only two legs. She asked herself, ”Why doesn’t this cow have many legs?“ She kept this thought in her heart.

She returned home. When she arrived, she called her children and said to them, ”Have you seen a very beautiful cow?“ The children said, ”No, we haven't seen it.“ She said, ”Come, let's go to the bush.“ They went to the bush and found the cow. The children were very surprised when they saw the cow standing on just two legs.

After that, the woman said, ”My children, this is a lesson. This cow will show you what a person can do if they have determination and patience. Even if you don’t have much, you can achieve what you want if you persevere in your work."
