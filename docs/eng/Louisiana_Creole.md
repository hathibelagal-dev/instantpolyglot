# Louisiana Creole

Louisiana Creole, also known as Kouri-Vini or Louisiana French Creole, is a French-based creole language spoken primarily in Louisiana, USA. It developed from contact between French colonists, African slaves, and indigenous peoples in the 18th century. Today, it is spoken by around 10,000-20,000 people, mainly in south and central Louisiana, though exact numbers are difficult to determine due to the language's declining use and lack of official status.

## Historical Background

Louisiana Creole emerged in the early 18th century during the French colonial period in Louisiana. The language developed as a means of communication between French colonists, African slaves from various linguistic backgrounds, and to a lesser extent, Native American tribes in the region.

Key historical events that shaped the development of Louisiana Creole include:

1. The founding of New Orleans in 1718, which became a major center for the slave trade and cultural mixing.
2. The transfer of Louisiana to Spanish control in 1763, which introduced some Spanish influence to the language.
3. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803, which brought the region under American control and increased English influence.
4. The influx of Haitian refugees following the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804), which reinforced the creole-speaking population.

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Louisiana Creole faced increasing pressure from English and standardized French, leading to a decline in speakers. However, recent revitalization efforts have sought to preserve and promote the language.

## Phonology

### Vowels

Louisiana Creole has a system of 7 oral vowels and 3 nasal vowels:

| /p/ | Voiceless bilabial plosive | **pé** [pe] (can) |
| /b/ | Voiced bilabial plosive | **bèf** [bɛf] (beef) |

### Stress

Stress in Louisiana Creole is generally on the final syllable of a word, but it's not phonemic and doesn’t typically affect meaning. This pattern is similar to French, from which Louisiana Creole derives much of its phonology.

### Phonological Processes

Louisiana Creole exhibits several phonological processes that distinguish it from its lexifier language, French:

1. Final consonant deletion: Many words derived from French have lost their final consonants in Louisiana Creole:
   - French “tout” → LC **tou** [tu] (all)
   - French “noir” → LC **nwè** [nwɛ] (black)

2. Cluster reduction: Consonant clusters are often simplified:
   - French “prendre” → LC **pran** [pʁã] (to take)
   - French “quatre” → LC **kat** [kat] (four)

3. Nasalization: Vowels before nasal consonants are often nasalized, and the nasal consonant may be dropped:
   - French “bon” [bɔn] → LC **bon** [bõ] (good)
   - French “dans” [dɑ̃s] → LC **dan** [dã] (in)

4. Palatalization: Some consonants are palatalized before front vowels:
   - French “tuer” [tɥe] → LC **tché** [tʃe] (to kill)

5. Vowel harmony: In some dialects, there's a tendency for vowels to harmonize within a word:
   - **lézòt** → **lòzòt** (the others)

6. Diphthongization: Some vowels may be diphthongized in certain contexts:
   - **bèf** [bɛf] → [bjɛf] (beef)

These phonological processes contribute to the unique sound system of Louisiana Creole and reflect its historical development from French and other influencing languages.

## Orthography

Louisiana Creole doesn’t have a standardized orthography, but several writing systems have been proposed. The most common one is based on French orthography with some modifications. Here are some key features:

1. The letter 'é' represents /e/, while 'è' represents /ɛ/.
2. The letter 'o' can represent both /o/ and /ɔ/.
3. Nasal vowels are usually written with a final 'n' or 'm'.
4. The sound /ʃ/ is written as 'ch', and /ʒ/ as 'j'.
5. The sound /ɲ/ is often written as 'gn'.

Examples:
- **mo** [mo] (word)
- **dé** [de] (two)
- **pè** [pɛ] (father)
- **bon** [bõ] (good)
- **chyen** [ʃjɛ̃] (dog)
- **jou** [ʒu] (day)
- **gagné** [gaɲe] (get)

Some additional orthographic conventions include:

6. The use of 'w' to represent /w/, especially in diphthongs:
   - **nwè** [nwɛ] (black)
   - **twa** [twa] (you)

7. The use of 'y' to represent /j/:
   - **yé** [je] (they)
   - **bayou** [baju] (bayou)

8. The use of apostrophes to indicate elision:
   - **l'amou** (love)
   - **s'asiz** (to sit down)

9. The use of hyphens in compound words:
   - **gran-mè** (grandmother)
   - **piti-fil** (granddaughter)

It's important to note that due to the lack of standardization, spelling can vary between writers and regions. Some writers may prefer spellings that more closely resemble Standard French, while others may opt for spellings that more accurately reflect Louisiana Creole pronunciation.

## Grammar

### Nouns and Articles

Louisiana Creole nouns don’t have grammatical gender. Plurality is usually indicated by context or by using the plural marker **yé** after the noun.

Examples:
- **chat** (cat) / **chat yé** (cats)
- **liv** (book) / **liv yé** (books)

The definite article is **la**, which is used for both singular and plural nouns:
- **la chat** (the cat)
- **la chat yé** (the cats)

The indefinite article is **en** for singular nouns:
- **en chat** (a cat)

In some contexts, especially with body parts or unique objects, the definite article may be omitted:
- **Mo lévé men.** (I raised my hand.)
- **Solèy cho jodi-la.** (The sun is hot today.)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Louisiana Creole:

| Person | Subject | Object |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 1sg | **mo** | **mwen** |
| 2sg | **to** | **twa** |
| 3sg | **li** | **li** |
| 1pl | **nou** | **nou** |
| 2pl | **zòt** | **zòt** |
| 3pl | **yé** | **yé** |

Examples:
- **Mo konnin li.** (I know him/her.)
- **Yé wa twa.** (They see you.)

Possessive pronouns are formed by adding the possessive marker **-la** to the object pronouns:

- **mo-la** (my)
- **twa-la** (your)
- **li-la** (his/her)
- **nou-la** (our)
- **zòt-la** (your, plural)
- **yé-la** (their)

Examples:
- **mo-la liv** (my book)
- **li-la kaz** (his/her house)

Demonstrative pronouns:

- **sa-yé** (these/those)

Examples:
- **Sa sé en bon liv.** (This is a good book.)
- **Mo pa lé sa-yé.** (I don’t want these/those.)

Reflexive pronouns are formed by adding **kò** (body) to the possessive pronouns:
- **mo-la kò** (myself)
- **twa-la kò** (yourself)
- **li-la kò** (himself/herself)
- **nou-la kò** (ourselves)

- **yé-la kò** (themselves)

Example:
- **Li lavé li-la kò.** (He/she washed himself/herself.)

### Verbs

Louisiana Creole verbs don’t conjugate for person or number. Tense, aspect, and mood are indicated by pre-verbal markers.

Present tense is unmarked:
- **Mo manjé.** (I eat.)

Past tense is marked with **té**:
- **Mo té manjé.** (I ate.)

Future tense is marked with **ava**:
- **Mo ava manjé.** (I will eat.)

Progressive aspect is marked with **apé**:
- **Mo apé manjé.** (I am eating.)

Habitual aspect is marked with **ka**:
- **Mo ka manjé.** (I usually eat.)

Completive aspect is marked with **fini**:
- **Mo fini manjé.** (I have finished eating.)

Conditional mood is marked with **sré**:
- **Mo sré manjé.** (I would eat.)

Negation is formed by placing **pa** after the verb or after the tense/aspect marker:
- **Mo pa manjé.** (I don’t eat.)
- **Mo té pa manjé.** (I didn't eat.)

These markers can be combined to create more complex tenses and aspects:

- **Mo té apé manjé.** (I was eating.)
- **Mo té fini manjé.** (I had finished eating.)
- **Mo té sré manjé.** (I would have eaten.)

The imperative is formed by using the bare verb:
- **Manjé!** (Eat!)
- **Alé!** (Go!)

For polite requests, **souplé** (please) is often added:
- **Manjé souplé.** (Please eat.)

The passive voice is formed using the verb **gagné** (to get) followed by the past participle:
- **La tab gagné lavé.** (The table was washed.)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Louisiana Creole typically come after the noun they modify:

- **en gro chat** (a big cat)
- **dlo fré** (cold water)

Adjectives don’t agree in gender or number with the nouns they modify:
- **en gro chat** (a big cat)
- **dé gro chat** (two big cats)

Comparison is formed using **pli** for comparative and **pli... pasé** for superlative:

- **Li pli gro pasé mwen.** (He is bigger than me.)
- **Li pli gro pasé tou moun.** (He is the biggest of all.)

Some common adjectives:

### Question Formation

Questions can be formed by intonation alone or by using question words:

- **To manjé?** (Did you eat?)

- **Mo ava manjé diri.** (I will eat rice.)

Adjectives and possessives follow the noun:

- **en chat nwè** (a black cat)

## Dialectal Variation

While Louisiana Creole is primarily spoken in Louisiana, there are some regional variations:

### St. Martin Parish variety

This variety is considered more conservative and retains more French-like features:

- Use of **nou** for “we” instead of **no** used in other varieties
- Retention of /r/ in more contexts
- More frequent use of the possessive marker **a** instead of **-la**
  Example: **liv a mwen** instead of **liv mo-la** (my book)

### Pointe Coupee Parish variety

This variety shows more English influence:

- More English loanwords
- Tendency to use English word order in some constructions
- Use of **-em** as a transitive suffix, possibly influenced by English
  Example: **koupé-em** (to cut it) instead of **koupé li**

### New Orleans variety

The New Orleans variety has some unique features:

- More Spanish and English loanwords due to the city's diverse history
- Use of **yé** as a copula in some contexts where other varieties might use **sé**
- Distinctive vocabulary items, e.g., **wòdè** (to smell) instead of **santé** used elsewhere

### Natchitoches variety

This variety, spoken in northwestern Louisiana, shows some unique features:

- Retention of some archaic French forms
- Influence from Choctaw and other Native American languages in vocabulary
- Use of **mo** as both subject and object pronoun for first person singular

It's important to note that these dialectal differences are not always clear-cut, and there can be significant variation even within these regions. Moreover, due to the declining number of speakers and increased mobility, these distinctions may be becoming less pronounced over time.
