# Romani

Romani, also known as Romany or Roma language, is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by the Romani people. It has approximately 3-5 million speakers worldwide, with significant populations in Europe, the Americas, and parts of Asia. Romani is not a standardized language and has many dialects, influenced by the languages of the countries where Romani communities have settled.

## Phonology and Orthography

Romani phonology varies across dialects, but most varieties share common features. There is no standard orthography for Romani, and different writing systems are used depending on the country and dialect.

### Vowels

Most Romani dialects have 5-6 vowel phonemes:

| Vowel | IPA | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| a | [a] | open front unrounded |
| e | [e] | close-mid front unrounded |
| i | [i] | close front unrounded |
| o | [o] | close-mid back rounded |
| u | [u] | close back rounded |
| ə | [ə] | mid central (in some dialects) |

Some dialects also have vowel length distinctions, typically marked by doubling the vowel letter: **aa**, **ee**, **ii**, **oo**, **uu**.

### Consonants

The consonant inventory of Romani varies across dialects, but a common set includes:

| Consonant | IPA | Description |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| b | [b] | voiced bilabial plosive |
| c | [ts] | voiceless alveolar affricate |
| č | [tʃ] | voiceless postalveolar affricate |

- **ba**xt (luck)
- bax**ta**-lo (lucky)

### Writing Systems

Romani is written using various alphabets, depending on the country and dialect. Some common writing systems include:

1. Latin alphabet (with diacritics)
2. Cyrillic alphabet (in some Eastern European countries)
3. Devanagari script (in some parts of India)

For this overview, we'll use a Latin-based orthography with diacritics.

## Morphology

Romani has a rich morphological system, with both inflectional and derivational processes.

### Nouns

Romani nouns have two genders (masculine and feminine), two numbers (singular and plural), and various cases. The exact number of cases varies by dialect, but commonly includes:

1. Nominative
2. Accusative
3. Dative
4. Genitive
5. Locative
6. Instrumental
7. Ablative (in some dialects)
8. Vocative (in some dialects)

Example noun declensions:

Romani verbs are conjugated for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood. The verb system is complex and shows variation across dialects.

Present tense conjugation of **ker-** (to do):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **ker-av** | **ker-as** |

### Particles and Clitics

Romani makes use of various particles and clitics, including:

- **si** (is, exists)
- **naj** (is not, does not exist)
- **te** (subjunctive/conditional marker)
- **ka** / **va** (future marker)

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Romani is typically Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), but it can be flexible due to the case system. For example:

### Questions

Yes/no questions are often formed by intonation alone or by using the question particle **li**:

## Dialectal Variation

Romani dialects are numerous and diverse, often classified into Vlax, Balkan, Central, and Northwestern branches. Some major dialect groups include:

1. Vlax Romani: Spoken in Romania, Moldova, and parts of the Balkans
   Example: **Kon san tu?** (Who are you?)

- The 1st person singular present of “to be”:
  Vlax: **sem**
  Sinti: **hom**
  Finnish Kalo: **som**

## Sociolinguistic Aspects

Romani has traditionally been an oral language, with written forms developing relatively recently. Its use is often restricted to family and community settings, with many Romani speakers being bilingual or multilingual in the dominant languages of their countries of residence.

Code-switching and borrowing are common phenomena in Romani speech, reflecting the language's adaptability and the multilingual nature of many Romani communities.

Example of code-switching (Romani-English):
**Me džav ando shop te kinav bread.** (I'm going to the shop to buy bread.)

Para-Romani varieties have developed in some areas, where Romani vocabulary is used with the grammar of another language. An example is Anglo-Romani:
**Mandi jins a rakli.** (I know a girl.) - uses Romani vocabulary with English grammar.

## Linguistic Features

### Evidentiality

Some Romani dialects have developed evidential markers, showing the source of information. For example, in some Balkan Romani dialects:

- **o Rom avel-a** (The Rom is coming - speaker is certain)
- **o Rom avel-asa** (The Rom is coming - speaker has heard this from someone else)

### Loanword Adaptation

Romani has developed strategies for adapting loanwords, often using specific suffixes:

- **-os** for masculine nouns: **telefon-os** (telephone)
- **-a** for feminine nouns: **škol-a** (school)

### Aspectual System

The aspectual system in Romani is complex, with perfective forms often created through prefixation or stem changes:

### Aspectual System (continued)

- Imperfective: **ker-** (to do, make)
- Perfective: **ker-d-** (to do, make - completed action)

Other examples:
- Imperfective: **xa-** (to eat) / Perfective: **xa-l-** (to eat up)
- Imperfective: **pij-** (to drink) / Perfective: **pi-l-** (to drink up)

### Valency-changing Operations

Romani has several methods for changing verb valency:

1. Causative: Often formed with the suffix **-ar-**
   Example: **asal** (to laugh) → **asar-** (to make laugh)

2. Medio-passive: Often formed with the suffix **-jov-**
   Example: **phabarel** (to burn something) → **phabjov-** (to burn oneself, to be burnt)

### Reduplication

Reduplication is used in some Romani dialects for emphasis or to create distributive meanings:

- **jekh-jekh** (one by one)
- **kher-kher** (house to house, in every house)

## Syntax (continued)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Romani are typically introduced by the relativizer **kaj** or **so**:

- **O čhavo, kaj dikhľom les, si miro phral.** (The boy whom I saw is my brother.)
- **E phabaj, so kinďom la, sas loli.** (The apple that I bought was red.)

### Coordination

Coordination is often expressed using conjunctions such as:

- **thaj** (and)
- **vaj** (or)
- **ama** (but)

Example: **Kamav te xav thaj te pijav.** (I want to eat and drink.)

### Subordination

Subordinate clauses are often introduced by conjunctions such as:

Example: **Phenďom leske te avel, kana kerďom o xaben.** (I told him to come when I made the food.)

## Pragmatics

### Politeness

Politeness in Romani is often expressed through:

1. Honorific pronouns: Some dialects use **tume** (2nd person plural) as a polite form for addressing individuals.

2. Indirect requests: Using subjunctive constructions for politeness
   Example: **Šaj te des man o lon?** (Could you pass me the salt? Lit: Can that you give me the salt?)

3. Diminutives: Often used to show affection or politeness
   Example: **čhavoro** (little boy, dear boy) from **čhavo** (boy)

### Discourse Markers

Romani uses various discourse markers, including:

- **šun** (listen, used to draw attention)
- **no** (well, so)
- **čačes** (truly, really)

Example: **Šun, čačes si importanto.** (Listen, it's really important.)

## Idiomatic Expressions

Romani has many idiomatic expressions, often reflecting cultural values and experiences. Some examples:

- **Te xal tut e baxt.** (May luck eat you - a blessing, meaning “may you have good luck”)
- **Lačho drom!** (Good road - used as a farewell, wishing a good journey)
- **Nais tuke devlesa!** (Thank you with God - a way of expressing deep gratitude)

## Taboo and Euphemisms

Like many languages, Romani has taboo words and euphemisms, particularly relating to death, bodily functions, and supernatural beings:

- **džal peskere dromeса** (to go one's own way - euphemism for dying)
- **o Beng** (the Crooked One - euphemism for the devil)

## Language Contact Phenomena

Due to the diaspora nature of Romani communities, the language shows significant influence from contact languages:

1. Lexical borrowing: Many words are borrowed from local languages
   Example: **fenstra** (window, from Romanian “fereastră”)

2. Calques: Some expressions are direct translations from other languages
   Example: **del avri** (to give out, meaning “to publish” - calque from German “ausgeben”)

3. Phonological influence: Some dialects have adopted phonemes from contact languages
   Example: The sound [ʒ] in some dialects, borrowed from Slavic languages

## Writing System Variations

While there's no standardized writing system for Romani, several systems have been proposed or used:

1. Pan-Vlax system: Used for Vlax dialects
   Example: **Savo si tyo anav?** (What is your name?)

2. Polish Romani orthography:
   Example: **Syr tut kharen?** (What's your name?)

3. International Romani Union Standard:
   Example: **Sar bushes?** (What's your name?)

## Romani in Education

In some countries, efforts have been made to introduce Romani language education:

- In Romania, some schools offer Romani language classes
- In Sweden, Romani is recognized as a minority language and is taught in some schools

Example of a basic phrase used in education:
**Putren tumare lilǎ.** (Open your books.)

## Modern Usage and Media

Despite challenges, Romani is increasingly used in modern contexts:

1. Literature: There's a growing body of Romani literature
   Example: “O kham perel” (The Sun Sets) by Mateo Maximoff

2. Music: Many Romani musicians incorporate Romani lyrics
   Example lyric: **Me sem rom, tu san rom** (I am Roma, you are Roma)

3. Social media: Romani is used on platforms like Facebook and YouTube
   Example hashtag: #RomaniPride

4. News media: Some countries have Romani-language news programs
   Example headline: **Neve kanuna ande Evropa** (New laws in Europe)

## Cognitive Aspects

Research has shown interesting cognitive effects of Romani bilingualism:

1. Enhanced metalinguistic awareness due to early bilingualism
2. Code-switching as a cognitive resource

Example of complex code-switching:
**Me džav ando shop te kinav bread thaj milk.** (I'm going to the shop to buy bread and milk.)

## Challenges and Preservation Efforts

Romani faces several challenges:

1. Lack of standardization
2. Limited official recognition
3. Stigmatization and language shift

However, there are ongoing preservation efforts:

1. Language documentation projects
2. Development of teaching materials
3. Promotion of Romani culture and language through festivals and events

Example of a language preservation slogan:
**Amari čhib, amaro barvalipe!** (Our language, our wealth!)

## Conclusion

Romani is a rich and complex language with a fascinating history and a vibrant present. Its resilience in the face of historical challenges and its adaptability to diverse linguistic environments make it a unique case study in sociolinguistics. As efforts to preserve and promote the language continue, Romani stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of its speakers and their culture.
