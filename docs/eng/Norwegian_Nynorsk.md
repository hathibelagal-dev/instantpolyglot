# Norwegian Nynorsk

Nynorsk, meaning “New Norwegian,” is one of the two official written standards of the Norwegian language, alongside Bokmål. It was developed in the mid-19th century by Ivar Aasen as a written standard based on rural Norwegian dialects, in contrast to the Danish-influenced Bokmål. Today, Nynorsk is used by about 10-15% of Norway's population as their primary written form.

## Alphabet and Pronunciation

Nynorsk uses the same 29-letter alphabet as Bokmål:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Æ Ø Å

The letters C, Q, W, X, and Z are only used in loanwords and names.

## Morphology

### Nouns

Nynorsk nouns have two genders: common (which combines masculine and feminine) and neuter. Some dialects and more conservative Nynorsk variants maintain a three-gender system (masculine, feminine, neuter).

Nouns are inflected for definiteness and number:

| Gender | Indefinite Singular | Definite Singular | Indefinite Plural | Definite Plural |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Common | en **bil** (a car) | **bil**en (the car) | **bil**ar (cars) | **bil**ane (the cars) |
| Neuter | eit **hus** (a house) | **hus**et (the house) | **hus** (houses) | **hus**a (the houses) |

Some common nouns have irregular plural forms:

- **barn** (child) → **barn** (children)
- **fot** (foot) → **føter** (feet)
- **hand** (hand) → **hender** (hands)

### Adjectives

Adjectives agree with nouns in gender, number, and definiteness:

| Gender | Indefinite Singular | Definite Singular/Plural |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Common | ein **stor** bil (a big car) | den **store** bilen (the big car) |
| Neuter | eit **stort** hus (a big house) | det **store** huset (the big house) |
| Plural | **store** bilar/hus (big cars/houses) | dei **store** bilane/husa (the big cars/houses) |

Some adjectives have irregular forms:

- **god** (good) → **godt** (neuter), **gode** (plural/definite)
- **liten** (small) → **lite** (neuter), **små** (plural)

Comparative and superlative forms:

- **stor** (big) → **større** (bigger) → **størst** (biggest)
- **fin** (nice) → **finare** (nicer) → **finast** (nicest)

Irregular comparatives and superlatives:

### Verbs

Nynorsk verbs are conjugated for tense but not for person or number. The infinitive typically ends in -e or -a.

Present tense:
- Regular: add -r to the infinitive
  **å spele** (to play) → **spelar** (play/plays)
- Irregular: 
  **å vere** (to be) → **er** (am/is/are)
  **å gjere** (to do) → **gjer** (do/does)

Past tense:
- Weak verbs: add -a, -te, or -de
  **å spele** → **spela** (played)
  **å kjøpe** (to buy) → **kjøpte** (bought)
- Strong verbs: change the stem vowel
  **å skrive** (to write) → **skreiv** (wrote)
  **å synge** (to sing) → **song** (sang)

Perfect tense:
- Formed with **ha** (have) + past participle
  **Eg har spela** (I have played)
  **Ho har skrive** (She has written)

Future tense:
- Formed with **skal** or **vil** + infinitive
  **Eg skal spele** (I will play)
  **Vi vil reise** (We will travel)

Passive voice:
- Formed with -st ending or **bli** + past participle
  **Huset byggjast** (The house is being built)
  **Boka blir lesen** (The book is being read)

### Adverbs

Many adverbs are formed by adding -t to the neuter form of adjectives:

- **rask** (quick) → **raskt** (quickly)
- **god** (good) → **godt** (well)

Some common adverbs:

- **alltid** (always)
- **aldri** (never)

## Syntax

### Word Order

Nynorsk generally follows the SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order:

**Eg les ei bok** (I read a book)

In questions, the verb comes before the subject:

**Les du ei bok?** (Are you reading a book?)

In subordinate clauses, the word order remains SVO:

**Eg veit at du les ei bok** (I know that you are reading a book)

### Negation

Negation is formed by placing **ikkje** after the verb:

**Eg les ikkje ei bok** (I am not reading a book)

In subordinate clauses, **ikkje** comes before the main verb:

**Eg veit at du ikkje les ei bok** (I know that you are not reading a book)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by inverting the subject and verb:

**Les du?** (Do you read?)

Wh-questions start with the question word, followed by the verb and then the subject:

**Kva les du?** (What are you reading?)

### Compound Words

Nynorsk, like other Germanic languages, frequently uses compound words:

**fotball** (foot + ball = football/soccer)
**kjøkkenbenk** (kitchen + bench = kitchen counter)
**verdskrig** (world + war = world war)

## Vocabulary

Nynorsk vocabulary often differs from Bokmål, favoring words of Norse origin over Danish or German loanwords. Some examples:

| Nynorsk | Bokmål | English |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **augneblunk** | **øyeblikk** | moment |
| **gamal** | **gammel** | old |
| **hugse** | **huske** | remember |
| **kjøken** | **kjøkken** | kitchen |
| **laurdøger** | **døgn** | 24-hour period |
| **røynd** | **erfaring** | experience |
| **skuld** | **skyld** | fault, guilt |
| **trøytt** | **trett** | tired |

### Common Phrases

- **God dag** - Hello (Good day)
- **Takk** - Thank you
- **Ver så snill** - Please
- **Kva heiter du?** - What's your name?
- **Eg heiter...** - My name is...
- **Korleis har du det?** - How are you?
- **Eg har det bra** - I'm fine
- **Snakkar du engelsk?** - Do you speak English?
- **Eg forstår ikkje** - I don’t understand
- **Ha det bra** - Goodbye (Have it good)

## Dialectal Variation

While Nynorsk is a standardized written form, it allows for more dialectal variation than Bokmål. Some examples of regional variations:

1. Pronoun variation:
   - **eg** (I) in Western Norway vs. **je** in some Eastern dialects
   - **me** (we) in some dialects vs. standard **vi**

2. Verb forms:
   - **kasta** vs. **kaste** (to throw)
   - **fortalde** vs. **fortalte** (told)

3. Noun plurals:
   - **-ar** vs. **-er** endings (e.g., **gutar** vs. **guter** for “boys”)

4. Vocabulary differences:
   - **då** vs. **når** for “when”
   - **liten** vs. **liti** for “small” (feminine)

## Stylistic Features

Nynorsk writing often employs certain stylistic features that distinguish it from Bokmål:

1. More use of active voice and concrete verbs
2. Preference for compound words over prepositional phrases
3. Greater use of native Norwegian words over loanwords
4. More frequent use of the present participle (e.g., **gangande** - walking)
5. Tendency to use reflexive forms of verbs (e.g., **trivast** instead of **trives** - to thrive)

## Orthographic Reforms

Nynorsk has undergone several reforms since its creation:

1. 1901: First official Nynorsk orthography
2. 1917: Alignment with Bokmål in some areas
3. 1938: Major reform, further alignment with Bokmål
4. 1959: Minor adjustments
5. 2012: Latest reform, allowing more variation

These reforms have aimed to simplify the language and bring it closer to spoken Norwegian dialects while maintaining its distinct character. The 2012 reform, for instance, allowed for more spelling variants to accommodate different dialectal pronunciations.

## Grammatical Details

### Definite and Indefinite Articles

Nynorsk uses both definite and indefinite articles:

Indefinite articles:

1. Urban vs. Rural: Nynorsk is more commonly used in rural areas, leading to perceptions of it as a “countryside language.”

2. Learning Difficulties: Some students find it challenging to learn both Nynorsk and Bokmål.

3. Cost: The requirement to produce official documents in both standards is sometimes criticized as costly.

4. Identity: For many, the choice between Nynorsk and Bokmål is tied to cultural and regional identity.
