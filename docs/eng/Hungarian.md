# Hungarian

Hungarian (Magyar) is a Uralic language spoken primarily in Hungary by about 13 million people. It is the official language of Hungary and is also spoken by Hungarian communities in neighboring countries such as Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, and Ukraine. Unlike most European languages, Hungarian is not Indo-European but belongs to the Finno-Ugric branch of the Uralic language family, making it distantly related to Finnish and Estonian. The language is known for its complex grammar, agglutinative structure, and unique phonology.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Hungarian uses the Latin alphabet with additional letters. The language has a largely phonetic orthography, meaning that each letter generally corresponds to one sound. This makes reading and pronunciation relatively straightforward once the rules are learned.

### Vowels

Hungarian has 14 vowel phonemes, distinguished by length and quality:

| Short | Long | Sound | Example |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| a | á | [ɒ], [aː] | alma (apple), ház (house) |
| e | é | [ɛ], [eː] | este (evening), kéz (hand) |
| i | í | [i], [iː] | kis (small), víz (water) |
| o | ó | [o], [oː] | sok (many), jó (good) |
| ö | ő | [ø], [øː] | öt (five), kő (stone) |
| u | ú | [u], [uː] | kutya (dog), út (road) |
| ü | ű | [y], [yː] | üveg (glass), tű (needle) |

Long vowels are marked with an acute accent (´) or, in the case of ő and ű, a double acute accent (˝). The length of the vowel can change the meaning of a word, for example:

- kor (age) vs. kór (disease)
- örül (he/she rejoices) vs. őrül (he/she goes mad)

### Consonants

Hungarian consonants include:

| Letter | Sound | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| b | [b] | bab (bean) |
| c | [ts] | cica (kitten) |
| cs | [tʃ] | csók (kiss) |
| d | [d] | dió (walnut) |
| dz | [dz] | madzag (string) |
| dzs | [dʒ] | dzsem (jam) |
| f | [f] | fű (grass) |
| g | [ɡ] | gomb (button) |
| gy | [ɟ] | gyerek (child) |
| h | [h] | hal (fish) |
| j | [j] | jég (ice) |
| k | [k] | kéz (hand) |
| l | [l] | levél (leaf, letter) |
| ly | [j] | folyó (river) |
| m | [m] | méz (honey) |
| n | [n] | nap (sun, day) |
| ny | [ɲ] | nyár (summer) |
| p | [p] | pap (priest) |
| r | [r] | rák (crab) |
| s | [ʃ] | só (salt) |
| sz | [s] | szél (wind) |
| t | [t] | tél (winter) |
| ty | [c] | tyúk (hen) |
| v | [v] | vas (iron) |
| z | [z] | zöld (green) |
| zs | [ʒ] | zseb (pocket) |

Note that some consonants are represented by digraphs (cs, gy, ly, ny, sz, ty, zs) or even a trigraph (dzs). These are considered single consonants in Hungarian.

### Consonant assimilation

Hungarian has extensive consonant assimilation rules. For example:

- Voicing assimilation: készben [keːzbɛn] (in readiness)
- Full assimilation: különben [kylømbɛn] (otherwise)

### Vowel harmony

Vowel harmony is a key feature of Hungarian phonology. Vowels in a word (including suffixes) must be either all front or all back. For this purpose, Hungarian vowels are grouped as follows:

- Front vowels: e, é, i, í, ö, ő, ü, ű
- Back vowels: a, á, o, ó, u, ú

Some words contain both front and back vowels. These are typically compound words or loanwords. In such cases, the last vowel of the stem determines the harmony of suffixes.

Examples of vowel harmony in action:

- ház-ban (in the house) - back vowels
- kert-ben (in the garden) - front vowels
- papír-on (on paper) - mixed stem, back vowel suffix
- hotel-ben (in the hotel) - mixed stem, front vowel suffix

### Stress

Stress in Hungarian is always on the first syllable of a word. This applies to compound words as well, where the stress falls on the first syllable of the first element.

## Morphology

Hungarian is a highly agglutinative language, meaning that grammatical information is primarily expressed through the addition of suffixes to word stems. This allows for the creation of very long words that express complex meanings.

### Nouns

Nouns in Hungarian do not have grammatical gender. They are inflected for number, possession, and case.

#### Number

The plural of nouns is generally formed by adding -k to the stem:

- asztal (table) → asztalok (tables)
- szék (chair) → székek (chairs)

Note the vowel change in some words to maintain vowel harmony.

#### Cases

Hungarian has a large number of cases (around 18-20, depending on analysis). Here are some of the most common:

| Case | Suffix | Usage | Example |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| Nominative | - | Subject | A fiú olvas. (The boy reads.) |
| Accusative | -t | Direct object | Könyvet olvasok. (I'm reading a book.) |
| Dative | -nak/-nek | Indirect object, possession | A fiúnak adok egy könyvet. (I give a book to the boy.) |
| Instrumental | -val/-vel | With, by means of | Tollal írok. (I write with a pen.) |
| Locative | -ban/-ben | In | A házban vagyok. (I'm in the house.) |
| Illative | -ba/-be | Into | Megyek a házba. (I'm going into the house.) |
| Elative | -ból/-ből | Out of | Kijövök a házból. (I'm coming out of the house.) |
| Sublative | -ra/-re | Onto | Teszem a könyvet az asztalra. (I put the book onto the table.) |
| Superessive | -on/-en/-ön | On | A könyv az asztalon van. (The book is on the table.) |
| Delative | -ról/-ről | From (off of) | Leveszem a könyvet az asztalról. (I take the book from the table.) |
| Terminative | -ig | Until, as far as | Budapestig utazom. (I'm traveling to Budapest.) |

Example declension of “ház” (house):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | ház | házak |
| Accusative | házat | házakat |
| Dative | háznak | házaknak |
| Instrumental | házzal | házakkal |
| Locative | házban | házakban |
| Illative | házba | házakba |
| Elative | házból | házakból |
| Sublative | házra | házakra |
| Superessive | házon | házakon |
| Delative | házról | házakról |

#### Possession

Possession in Hungarian is indicated by suffixes on the possessed noun. These suffixes agree with the person and number of the possessor:

| Person | Singular possessor | Plural possessor |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1st | házam (my house) | házunk (our house) |
| 2nd | házad (your house) | házatok (your [pl.] house) |
| 3rd | háza (his/her house) | házuk (their house) |

When the possessor is explicitly stated, it takes the dative case:

- Péternek a háza (Peter's house, literally “to Peter his house”)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | én | mi |
| 2nd | te | ti |
| 3rd | ő | ők |

Demonstrative pronouns:
- ez (this), ezek (these)
- az (that), azok (those)

Interrogative pronouns:
- ki (who)
- mi (what)
- melyik (which)

Relative pronouns:
- aki (who)
- ami (which, that)
- amelyik (which)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Hungarian precede the noun they modify and do not agree in number or case:

- nagy ház (big house)
- nagy házak (big houses)
- nagy házban (in the big house)

Comparison of adjectives:
- Comparative: -bb (nagyobb - bigger)
- Superlative: leg- + -bb (legnagyobb - biggest)

When used predicatively, adjectives may take endings:
- A ház nagy. (The house is big.)
- A házak nagyok. (The houses are big.)

### Verbs

Hungarian verbs are conjugated for person, number, tense, mood, and definiteness. The distinction between definite and indefinite conjugations is a unique feature of Hungarian.

#### Present tense

Example with “olvas” (to read):

| Person | Indefinite | Definite |
|--------|------------|----------|
| én | olvas**ok** | olvas**om** |
| te | olvas**ol** | olvas**od** |
| ő | olvas | olvas**sa** |
| mi | olvas**unk** | olvas**suk** |
| ti | olvas**tok** | olvas**sátok** |
| ők | olvas**nak** | olvas**sák** |

The definite conjugation is used when the object is definite (e.g., “I read the book”), while the indefinite is used otherwise.

#### Past tense

The past tense is formed by adding -t or -tt to the stem, followed by personal endings:

| Person | Indefinite | Definite |
|--------|------------|----------|
| én | olvas**tam** | olvas**tam** |
| te | olvas**tál** | olvas**tad** |
| ő | olvas**ott** | olvas**ta** |
| mi | olvas**tunk** | olvas**tuk** |
| ti | olvas**tatok** | olvas**tátok** |
| ők | olvas**tak** | olvas**ták** |

#### Future tense

The future is typically formed using the auxiliary “fog” with the infinitive:

- olvasni fogok (I will read)
- olvasni fogsz (you will read)
- olvasni fog (he/she will read)

Alternatively, the present tense can be used with future meaning, often with a time adverb:
- Holnap olvasok. (I'll read tomorrow.)

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed by adding -j to the stem, with various sound changes:

- olvass! (read! - informal singular)
- olvasson! (read! - formal singular or informal plural)
- olvassatok! (read! - informal plural)
- olvassanak! (read! - formal plural)

#### Conditional

The conditional is formed with the suffix -na/-ne or -ná/-né:

| Person | Indefinite | Definite |
|--------|------------|----------|
| én | olvas**nék** | olvas**nám** |
| te | olvas**nál** | olvas**nád** |
| ő | olvas**na** | olvas**ná** |
| mi | olvas**nánk** | olvas**nánk** |
| ti | olvas**nátok** | olvas**nátok** |
| ők | olvas**nának** | olvas**nák** |

#### Subjunctive

The subjunctive mood in Hungarian is identical to the imperative in form:

- **Azt akarom, hogy olvasson.** (I want him/her to read.)

#### Verbal prefixes

Hungarian uses verbal prefixes (igekötők) to modify the meaning of verbs, often changing their aspect or adding directional information:

- **meg-** (perfective): megír (to write [completely])
- **el-** (away): elmegy (to go away)
- **be-** (into): bemegy (to go in)
- **ki-** (out): kimegy (to go out)
- **fel-** (up): felmegy (to go up)
- **le-** (down): lemegy (to go down)
- **át-** (across): átmegy (to go across)
- **vissza-** (back): visszamegy (to go back)

These prefixes can be separated from the verb in certain constructions, particularly in negative sentences or when another element is in focus:

- **Nem megyek el.** (I'm not going away.)
- **El akarok menni.** (I want to go away.)

### Numerals

Cardinal numbers:
- 0 - nulla
- 1 - egy
- 2 - kettő (két when used as an adjective)
- 3 - három
- 4 - négy
- 5 - öt
- 10 - tíz
- 20 - húsz
- 100 - száz
- 1000 - ezer

Numbers between 21 and 99 are formed by saying the tens followed by the ones:
- 21 - huszonegy (twenty-one)
- 35 - harmincöt (thirty-five)

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding -dik to the cardinal number:
- első (first)
- második (second)
- harmadik (third)
- negyedik (fourth)

## Syntax

The basic word order in Hungarian is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), but it is quite flexible due to the case system. The focus of the sentence (new or emphasized information) typically comes immediately before the verb:

- János könyvet olvas. (János is reading a book.)
- KÖNYVET olvas János. (It's a book that János is reading.)
- János A KÖNYVTÁRBAN olvas. (János is reading IN THE LIBRARY.)

Questions can be formed by intonation or by using question words:

- Olvasol? (Are you reading?)
- Mit olvasol? (What are you reading?)
- Hol olvasol? (Where are you reading?)
- Ki olvas? (Who is reading?)

Question words always come immediately before the verb.

Negation is formed by placing “nem” before the verb:

- Nem olvasok. (I'm not reading.)
- János nem könyvet olvas. (János is not reading a book.)

In negative sentences with a focus, “nem” comes before the focused element:

- János NEM A KÖNYVTÁRBAN olvas. (János is not reading in the library.)

There are no articles in Hungarian. Definiteness is expressed through the use of demonstratives or the definite verb conjugation:

- Olvasok egy könyvet. (I'm reading a book.)
- Olvasom a könyvet. (I'm reading the book.)

Subordinate clauses are often introduced by “hogy” (that):

- Tudom, hogy János olvas. (I know that János is reading.)

Relative clauses use relative pronouns that agree with their antecedent in number and case:

- A fiú, aki olvas, János. (The boy who is reading is János.)
- A könyv, amit olvasok, érdekes. (The book that I'm reading is interesting.)

## Vocabulary

Hungarian vocabulary has been influenced by various languages throughout its history, reflecting the cultural and political interactions of the Hungarian people. Some common sources of loanwords include:

1. Turkic languages: due to early contact before the Hungarians settled in the Carpathian Basin
   Examples: alma (apple), szakáll (beard), gyümölcs (fruit)

2. Slavic languages: due to geographical proximity after settlement
   Examples: szerda (Wednesday), csinál (to do), galamb (pigeon)

3. German: due to historical ties with Austria and the Habsburg Empire
   Examples: sógor (brother-in-law), erkély (balcony), krumpli (potato)

4. Latin: often in scientific, academic, or religious terms
   Examples: templom (church), iskola (school), professzor (professor)

5. Italian: particularly in music and cuisine
   Examples: operá (opera), szóló (solo), spagetti (spaghetti)

6. French: in fashion and cuisine
   Examples: butik (boutique), gardrób (wardrobe), parfüm (perfume)

7. English: particularly in modern technology, business, and pop culture
   Examples: menedzser (manager), internet, hamburger

Despite these influences, a large portion of the core vocabulary remains of Uralic origin. Some examples of words with Uralic roots:

- szem (eye)
- kéz (hand)
- víz (water)
- hal (fish)
- vér (blood)
- név (name)
- él (to live)

Hungarian also has a rich system of word formation, allowing for the creation of new words through compounding and derivation:

Compounding:
- földrengés (earthquake) = föld (earth) + rengés (shaking)
- számítógép (computer) = számító (calculating) + gép (machine)

Derivation:
- tanít (to teach) → tanító (teacher)
- olvas (to read) → olvasó (reader)
- szép (beautiful) → szépség (beauty)

## Usage notes

### Address

Hungarian has a complex system of formal and informal address:

- Informal: “te” (you singular), “ti” (you plural)
- Formal: “ön” (you singular), “önök” (you plural)
- Semi-formal: “maga” (you singular), “maguk” (you plural)

The choice depends on the relationship between speakers, age, and social context. Generally:

- “Te” is used among friends, family members, and when addressing children or animals.
- “Ön” is the most formal and polite form, used in official situations, with strangers, or to show respect.
- “Maga” is less formal than “ön” but more formal than “te”. It's often used with acquaintances or in rural areas.

When using formal address, verbs are conjugated in the third person:
- Hogy van ön? (How are you? - formal)
- Hogy vagy? (How are you? - informal)

### Names and titles

In Hungarian, the family name comes before the given name. For example, in the name “Nagy János”, “Nagy” is the family name and “János” is the given name.

Titles are used frequently and are placed before the family name:
- Nagy úr (Mr. Nagy)
- Kis asszony (Miss Kis)
- Kovács doktor úr (Dr. Kovács)

### Expressions and idioms

Hungarian has many colorful expressions and idioms. Here are a few examples:

- Nem esik messze az alma a fájától. (The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.)
- Több szem többet lát. (Many eyes see more. - equivalent to “Two heads are better than one.”)
- Könnyű, mint a tollpihe. (As light as a feather.)
- Úgy alszik, mint a mormota. (He sleeps like a groundhog. - equivalent to “He sleeps like a log.”)
- Nem látja a fától az erdőt. (He can’t see the forest for the trees.)

## Unique features

1. Agglutination: Hungarian can create very long words by adding multiple suffixes to a root word. This allows for precise and compact expression of complex ideas.
   Example: házaimban (in my houses) [ház (house) + aim (my, plural) + ban (in)]
   
   An extreme example: megszentségteleníthetetlenségeskedéseitekért 
   (for your [plural] continued behavior as if you could not be desecrated)

2. No grammatical gender: Unlike many European languages, Hungarian does not assign gender to nouns. This simplifies agreement but can be challenging for learners used to gendered languages.

3. Vowel harmony: Suffixes change their vowels to match the vowels in the word stem. This creates a harmonious sound but requires learners to categorize words and choose appropriate suffix forms.

4. Definite and indefinite conjugations: Verbs have different conjugations based on whether the object is definite or indefinite. This allows for precise expression of definiteness without articles.

5. Focus position: The element immediately preceding the verb is in focus, allowing for nuanced expressions of emphasis without changing word order dramatically.

6. Extensive case system: With 18-20 cases, Hungarian can express very specific spatial and temporal relationships without prepositions.

7. Distinct forms for alienable and inalienable possession: Hungarian distinguishes between possessions that can be separated from the possessor (alienable) and those that cannot (inalienable, like body parts or relatives).

8. Politeness built into the grammar: The T-V distinction (informal vs. formal “you”) is reflected not just in pronouns but in verb conjugations and certain set phrases.

9. No verb “to have”: Possession is expressed using the verb “van” (to be) and the dative case.
   Example: Nekem van egy kutyám. (I have a dog. - literally “To me is a dog-my”)

10. Productive word formation: Hungarian can easily create new words through compounding and derivation, allowing the language to adapt to new concepts quickly.

## Challenges for learners

1. Complex grammar: The extensive case system, agglutination, and vowel harmony can be overwhelming for beginners.

2. Word order: While flexible, the SOV order and focus position can be challenging for speakers of SVO languages like English.

3. Pronunciation: Some sounds, like gy [ɟ] or ű [yː], don’t exist in many other languages and can be difficult to produce.

4. Verb prefixes: The separable verb prefixes and their impact on meaning and aspect can be tricky to master.

5. Definite vs. indefinite conjugation: Understanding when to use each conjugation requires a good grasp of Hungarian grammar and can take time to internalize.

6. Idiomatic expressions: Like any language, Hungarian has many idioms that don’t translate literally and must be learned separately.

7. Cultural context: Understanding when to use formal vs. informal address and other cultural nuances is crucial for effective communication.
