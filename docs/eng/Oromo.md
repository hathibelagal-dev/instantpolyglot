# Oromo

Oromo (also known as Afaan Oromoo, meaning “language of the Oromo”) is an Afroasiatic language belonging to the Cushitic branch. It is native to the Ethiopian state of Oromia and spoken by the Oromo people and neighboring ethnic groups in the Horn of Africa. With approximately 30 million speakers, it is the most widely spoken language in Ethiopia and the fourth most widely spoken language in Africa.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Oromo has a rich consonant inventory, with several distinctive features not found in many other languages. Here's a table of Oromo consonants:

| | Bilabial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plosive | p b | t d | c ɟ | k g | ʔ |
| Ejective | p' | t' | c' | k' | |
| Implosive | ɓ | ɗ | | | |
| Nasal | m | n | ɲ | | |
| Fricative | f | s | ʃ | | h |
| Approximant | w | l | j | | |
| Trill | | r | | | |

Note the presence of ejective consonants (p', t', c', k') and implosive consonants (ɓ, ɗ), which are characteristic of many Ethiopian languages.

Examples of words with ejective consonants:
- **k'arra** [k'arra] (door)
- **c'ap'a** [tʃ'ap'a] (mud)

Examples of words with implosive consonants:
- **ɓaga** [ɓaga] (sheep)
- **ɗagaa** [ɗagaa] (stone)

### Vowels

Oromo has a simple five-vowel system:

| | Front | Central | Back |
|---|---|---|---|
| Close | i | | u |
| Mid | e | | o |
| Open | | a | |

Vowel length is phonemic in Oromo, meaning that the duration of a vowel can change the meaning of a word. Each of the five vowels has a short and long counterpart:

Short vowels: **a**, **e**, **i**, **o**, **u**
Long vowels: **aa**, **ee**, **ii**, **oo**, **uu**

Examples:
- **hama** [hama] (bad) vs. **hamaa** [hamaa] (worse)
- **lafa** [lafa] (earth) vs. **lafaa** [lafaa] (from earth)
- **bade** [bade] (lost) vs. **badee** [badee] (has been lost)
- **dhufe** [dhufe] (came) vs. **dhufee** [dhufee] (has come)

### Phonotactics

Oromo syllable structure is typically (C)V(C), where C represents a consonant and V a vowel. Consonant clusters are rare in native Oromo words but may occur in loanwords.

Examples of Oromo syllable structures:
- CV: **sa** (cow)
- CVC: **kan** (this)
- V: **a**-ni (I)
- VC: **of** (self)

In some dialects, particularly in eastern Oromo, consonant clusters may occur word-initially:
- **bna** (coffee)
- **kta** (road)

However, these clusters are often broken up with an epenthetic vowel in other dialects:
- **buna** (coffee)
- **karaa** (road)

### Stress

Stress in Oromo is not phonemic and generally falls on the penultimate syllable of a word. However, in words with long vowels, the stress tends to fall on the long vowel.

Examples:
- **ki-TAA-ba** (book)
- **bar-SIII-saa** (teacher)
- **moo-TOO-ra** (car)

In compound words, each component may retain its original stress:
- **mana-BAR-noo-TAA** (school, literally “house-learning”)

### Tone

While Oromo is not a tonal language in the same way as many other African languages, it does have a pitch accent system that can distinguish between otherwise identical words.

Examples:
- **hára** (lake) vs. **hàra** (donkey)
- **báduu** (to be lost) vs. **bàduu** (to want)

The exact realization of these pitch accents can vary between dialects.

## Orthography

Oromo has been written in various scripts throughout history, including the Ge'ez script (also known as Ethiopic). However, since the 1990s, the Latin alphabet (known as Qubee) has been officially adopted for writing Oromo.

The Oromo Latin alphabet consists of 33 letters:

**a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z '**

Additionally, it uses four digraphs:

**ch dh ny sh**

And five long vowels:

**aa ee ii oo uu**

Some notes on Oromo orthography:

1. The letter **c** represents the sound [tʃ], similar to “ch” in English “church”.
   Example: **caccabsuu** [tʃatʃtʃabsuu] (to break)

2. **x** represents [t'], a voiceless alveolar ejective.
   Example: **xaa'oo** [t'aa'oo] (ash)

3. **q** represents [k'], a voiceless velar ejective.
   Example: **qabeenya** [k'abeenja] (property)

4. **ph** represents [p'], a voiceless bilabial ejective.
   Example: **phaapha** [p'aap'a] (feather)

5. The apostrophe **'** represents the glottal stop [ʔ].
   Example: **sa'a** [saʔa] (cow)

6. The digraph **dh** represents the implosive [ɗ].
   Example: **dhugaa** [ɗugaa] (truth)

7. The digraph **ny** represents the palatal nasal [ɲ].
   Example: **nyaata** [ɲaata] (food)

8. The digraph **sh** represents the voiceless palato-alveolar fricative [ʃ].
   Example: **shashee** [ʃaʃee] (snake)

### Historical Writing Systems

Before the adoption of the Latin script, Oromo was written in various other scripts:

1. Ge'ez Script: Used historically, especially in religious contexts.
   Example: ኦሮሞ (Oromo)

2. Arabic Script: Used in some Islamic Oromo communities.
   Example: أورومو (Oromo)

3. Sabean Script: An ancient script used in some historical Oromo writings.

The transition to the Latin script (Qubee) was motivated by a desire for a writing system that could more accurately represent Oromo phonology and to promote literacy among Oromo speakers.

## Morphology

Oromo is an agglutinative language, meaning that words are formed by adding affixes to roots. This section will explore the complex morphological system of Oromo in detail.

### Nouns

Oromo nouns are marked for number, gender, and case.

#### Number

Oromo has singular and plural forms for nouns. The plural is often formed by adding the suffix **-oota** or **-wwan** to the singular form:

- **nama** (person) → **namoota** (people)
- **mana** (house) → **manneen** (houses)
- **kitaaba** (book) → **kitaabota** (books)
- **sa'a** (cow) → **sa'oota** (cows)

Some nouns have irregular plural forms:

- **ilma** (son) → **ilmaan** (sons)
- **intala** (daughter) → **intalaawwan** (daughters)
- **re'ee** (goat) → **re'oota** (goats)
- **lafa** (land) → **lafeen** (lands)

Collective nouns often use the singular form to refer to a group:
- **foon** (meat, can refer to multiple pieces)
- **buna** (coffee, can refer to multiple beans or cups)

#### Gender

Oromo has two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. Most nouns referring to male animate beings are masculine, while those referring to female animate beings are feminine. For inanimate objects, gender assignment can be arbitrary:

- **abbaa** (father) - masculine
- **haadha** (mother) - feminine
- **obboleessa** (brother) - masculine
- **obboleettii** (sister) - feminine
- **mana** (house) - masculine
- **biyyoo** (land) - feminine
- **aduu** (sun) - feminine
- **ji'a** (moon) - masculine

Some nouns can change gender to indicate biological sex:
- **saree** (dog) - masculine
- **sareeyyii** (female dog) - feminine

#### Case

Oromo has a complex case system with several cases:

1. Nominative (subject)
2. Accusative (direct object)
3. Genitive (possession)
4. Dative (indirect object)
5. Instrumental (means or instrument)
6. Locative (location)
7. Ablative (movement from)

Case is typically marked by suffixes, but the specific form can vary depending on the noun's gender and number.

Example of case marking for **nama** (person):

- Nominative: **namni** (the person, as subject)
  Example: **Namni ni dhufe.** (The person came.)

- Accusative: **nama** (the person, as object)
  Example: **Ani nama arge.** (I saw the person.)

- Genitive: **namaa** (of the person)
  Example: **Manni namaa guddaa dha.** (The person's house is big.)

- Dative: **namaaf** (to/for the person)
  Example: **Ani namaaf kitaaba kenne.** (I gave a book to the person.)

- Instrumental: **namaan** (with/by the person)
  Example: **Isheen namaan deemte.** (She went with the person.)

- Locative: **namatti** (at/in the person)
  Example: **Namatti argame.** (It was found on the person.)

- Ablative: **namarraa** (from the person)
  Example: **Namarraa fudhe.** (I took it from the person.)

#### Definiteness

Oromo does not have definite or indefinite articles like “the” or “a” in English. Definiteness is often inferred from context or can be indicated by demonstratives or possessives:

- **Kitaaba bite.** (I bought a book/the book.)
- **Kitaaba kana bite.** (I bought this book.)
- **Kitaaba koo bite.** (I bought my book.)

#### Possession

Possession can be indicated in several ways:

1. Using the genitive case:
   **nama**+**a** → **namaa** (of the person)
   Example: **Manni namaa** (the person's house)

2. Using possessive suffixes:
   - **-koo** (my)
   - **-kee** (your, singular)
   - **-saa** (his)
   - **-shee** (her)
   - **-keenna** (our)
   - **-keessan** (your, plural)
   - **-isaanii** (their)

   Example: **Manakoo** (my house)

3. Using a combination of both:
   **Manni abbaakoo** (My father's house)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Oromo typically follow the noun they modify and agree with it in number and gender:

- **nama dheeraa** (tall person)
- **namoota dheeroo** (tall people)
- **intala bareedaa** (beautiful girl)
- **intaloota bareedoo** (beautiful girls)

Adjectives can also be used predicatively:

- **Namichi dheeraa dha.** (The man is tall.)
- **Intalti bareeddu dhi.** (The girl is beautiful.)

Comparative and superlative forms of adjectives are formed analytically:

- Comparative: **caala** (more) + adjective
  Example: **Inni caala dheeraa dha.** (He is taller.)

- Superlative: **hundaarra** (more than all) + adjective
  Example: **Inni hundaarra dheeraa dha.** (He is the tallest.)

### Pronouns

Oromo has personal, demonstrative, interrogative, and relative pronouns.

#### Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Oromo distinguish between singular and plural, and between first, second, and third person:

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|---|---|
| 1st person | **ani** (I) | **nu** (we) |
| 2nd person | **ati** (you) | **isin** (you all) |
| 3rd person masc. | **inni** (he) | **isaan** (they) |
| 3rd person fem. | **ishiin** (she) | **isaan** (they) |

These pronouns change form based on their case role in the sentence. For example:

Nominative:
- **Ani deeme.** (I went.)
- **Ati deemte.** (You went.)

Accusative:
- **Inni na arge.** (He saw me.)
- **Ani si arge.** (I saw you.)

Dative:
- **Ishiin naaf kenne.** (She gave it to me.)
- **Ani ishiif kenne.** (I gave it to her.)

- **sun** (that)
- **kana** (this, accusative)

Examples:
- **Kitaaba kana barreesse.** (I wrote this book.)
- **Manni sun guddaa dha.** (That house is big.)

These pronouns can also function as determiners:
- **Kitaabni kun bareedaa dha.** (This book is beautiful.)

#### Interrogative Pronouns

Some common interrogative pronouns include:

- **eenyuu** (who)
- **maal** (what)
- **kam** (which)

- Plural: **warra**

Examples:
- **Namichi kan kitaaba barreesse ni dhufe.** (The man who wrote the book came.)

- **Namoota warra kaleessa arge hin beeku.** (I don’t know the people whom I saw yesterday.)

### Verbs

Oromo verbs are complex, with inflections for person, number, gender, tense, aspect, and mood. The verb system is one of the most intricate parts of Oromo grammar.

#### Verb Roots and Stems

Oromo verbs are built on roots, typically consisting of two or three consonants. Various affixes are added to these roots to create different verb forms. For example:

- Root: **dh-m** (eat)
  - **nyaachuu** (to eat)
  - **nyaate** (he ate)
  - **nyaachisiisa** (he causes to eat)

- Root: **d-m** (go)
  - **deemuu** (to go)
  - **deeme** (he went)
  - **deemsiisa** (he causes to go)

#### Person, Number, and Gender

Verbs agree with their subject in person, number, and gender. For example, the verb **deemuu** (to go):

- **Ani deeme.** (I went. - 1st person singular)
- **Ati deemte.** (You went. - 2nd person singular)
- **Inni deeme.** (He went. - 3rd person singular masculine)
- **Ishiin deemte.** (She went. - 3rd person singular feminine)
- **Nu deemne.** (We went. - 1st person plural)
- **Isin deemtan.** (You all went. - 2nd person plural)
- **Isaan deeman.** (They went. - 3rd person plural)

#### Tense and Aspect

Oromo distinguishes between past, present, and future tenses, as well as perfective and imperfective aspects.

1. Present Imperfective:
   **Ani deemaa jira.** (I am going.)
   **Ati dubbisaa jirta.** (You are reading.)

2. Past Perfective:
   **Ani deeme.** (I went.)
   **Ati dubbiste.** (You read.)

   **Ati dubbistee jirta.** (You have read.)

5. Past Imperfective:
   **Ani deemaa ture.** (I was going.)
   **Ati dubbisaa turte.** (You were reading.)

#### Mood

Oromo verbs can express various moods, including indicative, imperative, jussive, and conditional.

1. Indicative (used for statements of fact):
   **Inni kitaaba dubbisa.** (He reads a book.)

2. Imperative (used for commands):
   **Deem!** (Go! - singular)
   **Deemaa!** (Go! - plural)
   **Dubbisi!** (Read! - singular)
   **Dubbisaa!** (Read! - plural)

3. Jussive (let's...):
   **Haa deemnu.** (Let's go.)
   **Haa dubbisnu.** (Let's read.)

4. Conditional:
   **Yoo deemte, nan arga.** (If you go, I will see you.)
   **Osoo dubbiste, ni beekta ture.** (If you had read, you would have known.)

#### Causative

Oromo has a productive causative form, typically formed by adding the suffix **-sis-** or **-s-** to the verb stem:

- **barachuu** (to learn) → **barsiisuu** (to teach, literally “to cause to learn”)
- **deemuu** (to go) → **deemsiisuu** (to make go, to send)
- **dhuguu** (to drink) → **dhugsiisuu** (to make drink)

Example:
**Barsiisaan barattoonni akka baratan taasise.** (The teacher made the students learn.)

#### Passive

The passive voice is formed by adding the suffix **-am-** to the verb stem:

- **beekuu** (to know) → **beekamuu** (to be known)
- **arguu** (to see) → **argamuu** (to be seen)
- **bituu** (to buy) → **bitamuu** (to be bought)

Example:
**Dhugaan ni beekama.** (The truth is known.)
**Kitaabni kun guyyaa guyyaan ni bitama.** (This book is bought every day.)

#### Reflexive and Reciprocal

Reflexive verbs are formed by using the word **of** (self) before the verb:

- **Inni of arge.** (He saw himself.)
- **Ishiin of jaallatti.** (She loves herself.)

Reciprocal actions are expressed using **wal** (each other):

- **Isaan wal argan.** (They saw each other.)
- **Nu wal gargaarra.** (We help each other.)

#### Compound Verbs

Oromo frequently uses compound verbs, often combining a noun or adjective with a light verb like **godhu** (to make) or **ta'u** (to become):

- **hojii godhu** (to work, literally “to make work”)
- **gammachuu ta'u** (to become happy)

Example:
**Inni hojii godhe.** (He worked.)
**Ishiin gammachuu taate.** (She became happy.)

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Oromo is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV):

**Tolaan kitaaba bite.** (Tola bought a book.)
Subject (Tolaan) - Object (kitaaba) - Verb (bite)

However, word order can be more flexible in practice, especially in spoken Oromo. Other possible orders include:

- OSV: **Kitaaba Tolaan bite.** (It was a book that Tola bought.)
- SVO: **Tolaan bite kitaaba.** (Tola bought a book.) - This order is sometimes used for emphasis.

In complex sentences, dependent clauses usually precede the main clause:

**Yeroo inni dhufu, ani deema.** (When he comes, I will go.)

### Negation

Negation in Oromo is typically expressed by the particle **hin** before the verb and the suffix **-u** or **-n** at the end of the verb:

**Ani hin deemu.** (I don’t go.)
**Inni hin dhufi.** (He doesn’t come.)
**Ishiin hin beektu.** (She doesn’t know.)

In the past tense, the negative is formed differently:

**Ani hin deemne.** (I didn't go.)
**Inni hin dhufne.** (He didn't come.)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the particle **-moo** or **-hoo** to the end of a statement:

**Ati ni deemtaa?** (Are you going?)
**Inni dhufe moo?** (Did he come?)
**Ishiin beektuu?** (Does she know?)

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns, typically at the beginning of the sentence:

**Eessaa deemta?** (Where are you going?)
**Maal baratta?** (What are you studying?)
**Yoom dhufte?** (When did you come?)

### Conjunctions

Some common conjunctions in Oromo include:

- **fi** (and)
- **yookiin** (or)
- **garuu** (but)
- **sababii** (because)
- **yoo** (if)

Examples:
**Tolaa fi Caaltuu ni dhufan.** (Tola and Chaltu are coming.)
**Ani kitaaba yookiin barruulee dubbisa.** (I read books or articles.)
**Inni bareedaa dha garuu mi'aa miti.** (It's beautiful but not tasty.)
**Ani hin deemu sababii dhukkubsadheef.** (I'm not going because I'm sick.)
**Yoo roobe, mana tureera.** (If it rains, I'll stay home.)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Oromo typically follow the noun they modify and use the relative pronoun **kan** (which, who, that):

**Namichi kan kitaaba barreesse ni dhufe.** (The man who wrote the book came.)
**Kitaabni kan ani dubbise bareedaa ture.** (The book that I read was beautiful.)

For feminine nouns, **tan** is used instead of **kan**:
**Dubartittiin tan gabaabdu dhi.** (The woman who is short.)

For plural nouns, **warra** is used:
**Namoonni warra kaleessa dhufan deeman.** (The people who came yesterday left.)

### Focus and Topic

Oromo uses various strategies to indicate focus and topic:

1. Word order changes:
   **Kitaaba Caaltuu bite.** (It was a book that Chaltu bought.) - Object focus

2. Cleft constructions:
   **Kan kitaaba bite Caaltuu dha.** (It is Chaltu who bought the book.)

3. Particle **-tu/-tii**:
   **Caaltuutu kitaaba bite.** (It was Chaltu who bought the book.)

4. Topic marker **-n**:
   **Kitaabni-n, Caaltuu bite.** (As for the book, Chaltu bought it.)
