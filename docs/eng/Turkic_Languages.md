# Turkic Languages

The Turkic languages form a language family of over 35 documented languages, spoken by approximately 200 million people, primarily in Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Western Asia. The most widely spoken Turkic language is Turkish, with about 88 million speakers. Other major Turkic languages include Azerbaijani, Uzbek, Kazakh, and Uyghur.

## Phonology

Turkic languages generally share similar phonological features, though there are variations among individual languages.

### Vowels

Most Turkic languages have a system of vowel harmony, where vowels in suffixes agree with the vowels in the root word. Typically, there are eight vowels, divided into two groups:

Front vowels: e, i, ö, ü
Back vowels: a, ı, o, u

In Turkish, these are represented as:

| Letter | IPA | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| a | [a] | open front unrounded |
| e | [e] | close-mid front unrounded |
| ı | [ɯ] | close back unrounded |
| i | [i] | close front unrounded |
| o | [o] | close-mid back rounded |
| ö | [œ] | close-mid front rounded |
| u | [u] | close back rounded |
| ü | [y] | close front rounded |

Some languages, like Kazakh, have additional vowels:

| Letter | IPA | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| ә | [æ] | near-open front unrounded |
| ұ | [ʊ] | near-close back rounded |

### Consonants

Turkic languages typically have a rich consonant inventory. Here's an example from Turkish:

| Letter | IPA | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| b | [b] | voiced bilabial plosive |
| c | [dʒ] | voiced postalveolar affricate |
| ç | [tʃ] | voiceless postalveolar affricate |
| d | [d] | voiced alveolar plosive |
| f | [f] | voiceless labiodental fricative |
| g | [ɡ] | voiced velar plosive |
| ğ | [ɰ] or ∅ | voiced velar approximant or silent |
| h | [h] | voiceless glottal fricative |
| j | [ʒ] | voiced postalveolar fricative |
| k | [k] or [c] | voiceless velar or palatal plosive |
| l | [l] | alveolar lateral approximant |
| m | [m] | bilabial nasal |
| n | [n] | alveolar nasal |
| p | [p] | voiceless bilabial plosive |
| r | [ɾ] | alveolar tap |
| s | [s] | voiceless alveolar fricative |
| ş | [ʃ] | voiceless postalveolar fricative |
| t | [t] | voiceless alveolar plosive |
| v | [v] | voiced labiodental fricative |
| y | [j] | palatal approximant |
| z | [z] | voiced alveolar fricative |

Some Turkic languages have additional consonants. For example, Kazakh has:

| Letter | IPA | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| қ | [q] | voiceless uvular plosive |
| ң | [ŋ] | velar nasal |

### Stress

Stress patterns vary among Turkic languages. In Turkish, stress is typically on the last syllable of a word, with some exceptions:

- **kitáp** (book)
- **öğrénci** (student)
- **İstánbul** (Istanbul)

However, some suffixes do not receive stress:

- **kitaplár** (books)
- **öğrencíler** (students)

In Kazakh, stress is generally on the last syllable:

- **қалá** [qɑˈlɑ] (city)
- **мектéп** [mekˈtep] (school)

### Phonological processes

Turkic languages often exhibit various phonological processes:

1. Vowel harmony: Suffixes change their vowels to match the vowels in the root word.
   Turkish: **ev** (house) + locative suffix → **evde** (in the house)
             **kitap** (book) + locative suffix → **kitapta** (in the book)

2. Consonant assimilation: Consonants may change to match neighboring sounds.
   Turkish: **git-** (go) + past tense suffix → **gitti** (went)

3. Final devoicing: Voiced consonants at the end of words become voiceless.
   Turkish: **kitab** → **kitap** [kitap] (book)

## Morphology

Turkic languages are agglutinative, meaning that words are formed by adding suffixes to stems.

### Nouns

Nouns in Turkic languages are typically inflected for number, case, and possession.

#### Number

Most Turkic languages have a singular-plural distinction, with the plural usually formed by adding a suffix:

Turkish: 
- **ev** (house) → **evler** (houses)
- **kitap** (book) → **kitaplar** (books)

Kazakh:
- **үй** [ʏj] (house) → **үйлер** [ʏjler] (houses)
- **кітап** [kɪtɑp] (book) → **кітаптар** [kɪtɑptɑr] (books)

#### Case

Turkic languages typically have six to eight cases. Here's an example from Turkish:

| Case | Suffix | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Nominative | - | **ev** (house) |
| Accusative | -(y)I | **evi** (the house, as object) |
| Genitive | -(n)In | **evin** (of the house) |
| Dative | -(y)A | **eve** (to the house) |
| Locative | -DA | **evde** (in the house) |
| Ablative | -DAn | **evden** (from the house) |

Kazakh has seven cases:

| Case | Suffix | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Nominative | - | **үй** [ʏj] (house) |
| Accusative | -ны/-ні, -ды/-ді, -ты/-ті | **үйді** [ʏjdɪ] (the house, as object) |
| Genitive | -ның/-нің, -дың/-дің, -тың/-тің | **үйдің** [ʏjdɪŋ] (of the house) |
| Dative | -ға/-ге, -қа/-ке | **үйге** [ʏjge] (to the house) |
| Locative | -да/-де, -та/-те | **үйде** [ʏjde] (in the house) |
| Ablative | -дан/-ден, -тан/-тен, -нан/-нен | **үйден** [ʏjden] (from the house) |
| Instrumental | -мен/-бен/-пен | **үймен** [ʏjmen] (with the house) |

#### Possession

Possession is typically indicated by suffixes on the possessed noun:

Turkish:
- **ev** (house) → **evim** (my house), **evin** (your house), **evi** (his/her house)
- **kitap** (book) → **kitabım** (my book), **kitabın** (your book), **kitabı** (his/her book)

Kazakh:
- **үй** [ʏj] (house) → **үйім** [ʏjɪm] (my house), **үйің** [ʏjɪŋ] (your house), **үйі** [ʏjɪ] (his/her house)
- **кітап** [kɪtɑp] (book) → **кітабым** [kɪtɑbɯm] (my book), **кітабың** [kɪtɑbɯŋ] (your book), **кітабы** [kɪtɑbɯ] (his/her book)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Turkic languages are typically inflected for case. Here's an example from Turkish:

| Pronoun | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive | Dative |
|---------|------------|------------|----------|--------|
| I | ben | beni | benim | bana |
| you (sg.) | sen | seni | senin | sana |
| he/she/it | o | onu | onun | ona |
| we | biz | bizi | bizim | bize |
| you (pl.) | siz | sizi | sizin | size |
| they | onlar | onları | onların | onlara |

Kazakh personal pronouns:

| Pronoun | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive | Dative |
|---------|------------|------------|----------|--------|
| I | мен [men] | мені [menɪ] | менің [menɪŋ] | маған [mɑʁɑn] |
| you (sg.) | сен [sen] | сені [senɪ] | сенің [senɪŋ] | саған [sɑʁɑn] |
| he/she/it | ол [ol] | оны [onɯ] | оның [onɯŋ] | оған [oʁɑn] |
| we | біз [bɪz] | бізді [bɪzdɪ] | біздің [bɪzdɪŋ] | бізге [bɪzge] |
| you (pl.) | сіз [sɪz] | сізді [sɪzdɪ] | сіздің [sɪzdɪŋ] | сізге [sɪzge] |
| they | олар [olɑr] | оларды [olɑrdɯ] | олардың [olɑrdɯŋ] | оларға [olɑrʁɑ] |

### Adjectives

In most Turkic languages, adjectives are not inflected and precede the nouns they modify:

Turkish:
- **büyük ev** (big house)
- **kırmızı araba** (red car)

Kazakh:
- **үлкен үй** [ʏlken ʏj] (big house)
- **қызыл мәшине** [qɯzɯl mæʃɪne] (red car)

Comparison of adjectives is typically done with suffixes or separate words:

Turkish:
- Comparative: **daha** + adjective
  **büyük** (big) → **daha büyük** (bigger)
- Superlative: **en** + adjective
  **büyük** (big) → **en büyük** (biggest)

Kazakh:
- Comparative: -рақ/-рек, -ырақ/-ірек suffix
  **үлкен** [ʏlken] (big) → **үлкенірек** [ʏlkenɪrek] (bigger)
- Superlative: **ең** + adjective
  **үлкен** [ʏlken] (big) → **ең үлкен** [eŋ ʏlken] (biggest)

### Verbs

Verbs in Turkic languages are highly agglutinative, with suffixes indicating tense, aspect, mood, and person.

#### Infinitive

The infinitive form varies among Turkic languages:

Turkish: -mAk
- **yapmak** (to do)
- **gelmek** (to come)

Kazakh: -у [-w]
- **жасау** [ʒɑsɑw] (to do)
- **келу** [kelw] (to come)

#### Present tense

Turkish:
- **yapıyorum** (I am doing)
- **geliyorsun** (you are coming)

Kazakh:
- **жасап жатырмын** [ʒɑsɑp ʒɑtɯrmɯn] (I am doing)
- **келіп жатырсың** [kelɪp ʒɑtɯrsɯŋ] (you are coming)

#### Past tense

Turkish (definite past):
- **yaptım** (I did)
- **geldin** (you came)

Kazakh:
- **жасадым** [ʒɑsɑdɯm] (I did)
- **келдің** [keldɪŋ] (you came)

#### Future tense

Turkish:
- **yapacağım** (I will do)
- **geleceksin** (you will come)

Kazakh:
- **жасаймын** [ʒɑsɑjmɯn] (I will do)
- **келесің** [kelesɪŋ] (you will come)

#### Negation

Negation is typically formed by adding a suffix to the verb stem:

Turkish: -mA-
- **yapmıyorum** (I am not doing)
- **gelmeyeceğim** (I will not come)

Kazakh: -ма-/-ме-, -ба-/-бе-, -па-/-пе-
- **жасамаймын** [ʒɑsɑmɑjmɯn] (I am not doing)
- **келмеймін** [kelmejmɪn] (I will not come)

#### Question formation

Questions are typically formed by adding a particle or changing the intonation:

Turkish: mI (particle, harmonizes with the last vowel)
- **Geliyor musun?** (Are you coming?)

Kazakh: ма/ме, ба/бе, па/пе (particle)
- **Келіп жатырсың ба?** [kelɪp ʒɑtɯrsɯŋ bɑ] (Are you coming?)

### Postpositions

Turkic languages use postpositions instead of prepositions:

Turkish:
- **ev için** (for the house)
- **okul ile** (with the school)

Kazakh:
- **үй үшін** [ʏj ʏʃɪn] (for the house)
- **мектеппен** [mekteppen] (with the school)

## Syntax

Turkic languages typically follow a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order:

Turkish:
- **Ben kitap okuyorum.** (I book am-reading. / I am reading a book.)

Kazakh:
- **Мен кітап оқып жатырмын.** [men kɪtɑp oqɯp ʒɑtɯrmɯn] (I book reading am. / I am reading a book.)

However, word order can be more flexible due to the case system, especially for emphasis or in poetry.

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses in Turkic languages typically precede the noun they modify and are formed using participles:

Turkish:
- **okuduğum kitap** (the book that I read)
- **gelen adam** (the man who is coming)

Kazakh:
- **оқыған кітабым** [oqɯʁɑn kɪtɑbɯm] (the book that I read)
- **келе жатқан адам** [kele ʒɑtqɑn ɑdɑm] (the man who is coming)

### Conditional

Conditional sentences in Turkic languages are typically formed using specific verb suffixes:

Turkish:
- **Yağmur yağarsa, evde kalacağım.** (If it rains, I will stay at home.)
  [Conditional suffix: -sA]

Kazakh:
- **Жаңбыр жауса, үйде қаламын.** [ʒɑŋbɯr ʒɑwsɑ, ʏjde qɑlɑmɯn] (If it rains, I will stay at home.)
  [Conditional suffix: -са/-се]

### Causative

Turkic languages have productive causative morphology, allowing verbs to be modified to indicate that the subject causes someone else to perform the action:

Turkish:
- **yapmak** (to do) → **yaptırmak** (to make someone do)
- **Ev yaptırdım.** (I had a house built.)

Kazakh:
- **жасау** [ʒɑsɑw] (to do) → **жасату** [ʒɑsɑtw] (to make someone do)
- **Үй салдырдым.** [ʏj sɑldɯrdɯm] (I had a house built.)

### Passive

Passive voice is formed by adding specific suffixes to the verb:

Turkish:
- **yapmak** (to do) → **yapılmak** (to be done)
- **Bu iş yapıldı.** (This work was done.)

Kazakh:
- **жасау** [ʒɑsɑw] (to do) → **жасалу** [ʒɑsɑlw] (to be done)
- **Бұл жұмыс жасалды.** [bʊl ʒʊmɯs ʒɑsɑldɯ] (This work was done.)

## Lexicon

Turkic languages share a large common vocabulary, though there are also significant differences due to borrowings and independent developments.

### Common Turkic roots

Many basic words are shared across Turkic languages:

| Meaning | Turkish | Kazakh | Uzbek |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|

3. Calques (loan translations):
   Turkish: **gökyüzü** (sky, lit. "sky-face", calque from Persian)

## Dialects and Varieties

Turkic languages exhibit significant dialectal variation, both within and across national borders.

### Turkish dialects

1. Istanbul Turkish: The standard dialect
2. Black Sea dialect: Characterized by different vowel qualities
3. Southeastern dialect: Influenced by Arabic and Kurdish

Example (Standard vs. Black Sea):
Standard: **Ne yapıyorsun?** (What are you doing?)
Black Sea: **Niye yapaysun?**

Southern: **Қаяққа барасың?** [qɑjɑqqɑ bɑrɑsɯŋ]

## Writing Systems

Turkic languages have been written in various scripts throughout history:

1. Old Turkic script (Orkhon script): Used in early Turkic inscriptions

2. Arabic script: Used for centuries in many Turkic languages
   Example (Ottoman Turkish): محمد (Mehmed)

3. Latin script: Adopted by Turkey in 1928, also used in Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan
   Turkish example: **Merhaba, nasılsın?** (Hello, how are you?)

4. Cyrillic script: Used in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and some other Turkic-speaking regions
   Kazakh example: **Сәлем, қалың қалай?** [sælem, qɑlɯŋ qɑlɑj] (Hello, how are you?)

5. Uyghur Arabic script: Used for Uyghur in China
   Example: ياخشىمۇسىز (Hello)

### Turkish alphabet

The modern Turkish alphabet consists of 29 letters:

a, b, c, ç, d, e, f, g, ğ, h, ı, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, ö, p, r, s, ş, t, u, ü, v, y, z

Note the additional letters ç, ğ, ı, ö, ş, ü, which represent sounds specific to Turkish.

### Kazakh alphabet

The Kazakh Cyrillic alphabet consists of 42 letters:

а, ә, б, в, г, ғ, д, е, ё, ж, з, и, й, к, қ, л, м, н, ң, о, ө, п, р, с, т, у, ұ, ү, ф, х, һ, ц, ч, ш, щ, ъ, ы, і, ь, э, ю, я

Note the additional letters ә, ғ, қ, ң, ө, ұ, ү, һ, і, which represent sounds specific to Kazakh.

## Phonological and Morphological Processes

### Vowel Harmony

Vowel harmony is a key feature of Turkic languages, where vowels in suffixes change to match the vowels in the root word. There are typically two types of vowel harmony:

1. Backness harmony: Back vowels follow back vowels, front vowels follow front vowels.

2. Roundness harmony: Rounded vowels follow rounded vowels, unrounded vowels follow unrounded vowels.

Turkish example:
- **ev** (house) + locative suffix → **evde** (in the house)
- **kitap** (book) + locative suffix → **kitapta** (in the book)

Kazakh example:
- **үй** [ʏj] (house) + locative suffix → **үйде** [ʏjde] (in the house)
- **кітап** [kɪtɑp] (book) + locative suffix → **кітапта** [kɪtɑptɑ] (in the book)

### Consonant Assimilation

Consonants often change to match neighboring sounds in terms of voicing or place of articulation.

Turkish example:
- **git-** (go) + past tense suffix → **gitti** (went)
  The -t- of the stem assimilates to the -t- of the suffix.

Kazakh example:
- **кет-** [ket-] (go) + past tense suffix → **кетті** [kettɪ] (went)

### Final Devoicing

In many Turkic languages, voiced consonants at the end of words become voiceless.

Turkish example:
- **kitab** → **kitap** [kitap] (book)
- **ağaç** [aːtʃ] (tree) - the final ç is always voiceless

Kazakh example:
- **көз** [kœz] (eye) → **көс** [kœs] when word-final

### Epenthesis

Some Turkic languages insert vowels to break up consonant clusters.

Turkish example:
- **fikr** (thought) → **fikir**
- **hükm** (judgment) → **hüküm**

### Consonant Alternation

Some consonants alternate systematically in certain environments.

Turkish example:
- **kitap** (book) → **kitabı** (his/her book)
  The final -p becomes -b before a vowel-initial suffix.

Kazakh example:
- **көк** [kœk] (blue) → **көгі** [kœgɪ] (its blue)
  The final -k becomes -g before a vowel-initial suffix.

## Syntax Peculiarities

### Topic-Comment Structure

While the basic word order in Turkic languages is SOV, they often employ a topic-comment structure, where the topic of the sentence is placed at the beginning.

Turkish example:
- **Bu kitap, ben onu dün okudum.** (This book, I read it yesterday.)

Kazakh example:
- **Бұл кітап, мен оны кеше оқыдым.** [bʊl kɪtɑp, men onɯ keʃe oqɯdɯm] (This book, I read it yesterday.)

### Lack of "Have"

Turkic languages typically don't have a verb equivalent to "have". Instead, they use existential sentences with the possessed item as the subject and the possessor in the genitive case.

Turkish example:
- **Benim bir kitabım var.** (I have a book, lit. "My one book exists.")

Kazakh example:
- **Менің бір кітабым бар.** [menɪŋ bɪr kɪtɑbɯm bɑr] (I have a book, lit. "My one book exists.")

### Evidentiality

Many Turkic languages grammaticalize evidentiality, marking whether the speaker has direct or indirect evidence for their statement.

Turkish example:
- **Geldi.** (He came. - Speaker saw him come.)
- **Gelmiş.** (He apparently came. - Speaker didn't see him come, but inferred it.)

Kazakh example:
- **Келді.** [keldɪ] (He came. - Speaker saw him come.)
- **Келіпті.** [kelɪptɪ] (He apparently came. - Speaker didn't see him come, but inferred it.)

### Honorifics

Some Turkic languages have elaborate systems of honorifics, using different verb forms or pronouns to show respect.

Uzbek example:
- **Siz nima xohlaysiz?** (What do you want? - polite form)
- **Sen nima xohlaysan?** (What do you want? - familiar form)

### Converbs

Turkic languages make extensive use of converbs, non-finite verb forms that express adverbial relationships.

Turkish example:
- **Koşarak geldi.** (He came running.)
  The suffix -arak forms a converb meaning "by doing X".

Kazakh example:
- **Жүгіріп келді.** [ʒʏgɪrɪp keldɪ] (He came running.)
  The suffix -іп forms a converb indicating a simultaneous or immediately preceding action.
