## Grammar

### Nouns

Lao nouns are not inflected for number, gender, or case. Plurality is typically expressed through context or by using quantifiers.

Example:
**ໝາ** [mǎː] "dog/dogs"
**ໝາສອງໂຕ** [mǎː sɔ̌ːŋ tòː] "two dogs" (literally "dog two classifier")

### Classifiers

Lao uses classifiers when counting or specifying quantities of nouns. Common classifiers include:

- **ຄົນ** [kʰón] for people
- **ໂຕ** [tòː] for animals
- **ອັນ** [ʔán] for small objects

Example:
**ນັກຮຽນສາມຄົນ** [nák hían sǎːm kʰón] "three students"

### Pronouns

Lao pronouns vary based on the level of formality and the relationship between speakers. Some common pronouns include:

| Pronoun | Meaning | Usage |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **ຂ້ອຍ** [kʰɔ̂ːj] | I/me | General use |
| **ເຈົ້າ** [tɕâo] | you | General use |
| **ລາວ** [lǎːw] | he/she | General use |
| **ພວກເຮົາ** [pʰūak háw] | we | General use |
| **ເຂົາເຈົ້າ** [kʰǎw tɕâo] | they | General use |

### Verbs

Lao verbs do not conjugate for person, number, or tense. Tense and aspect are expressed through context or time markers.

Example:
**ກິນ** [kìn] "to eat"
**ກິນແລ້ວ** [kìn lɛ́ːw] "ate" (literally "eat already")
**ຈະກິນ** [tɕàʔ kìn] "will eat" (literally "will eat")

### Sentence Structure

The basic word order in Lao is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).

Example:
**ຂ້ອຍກິນເຂົ້າ** [kʰɔ̂ːj kìn kʰâo]
"I eat rice"

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Lao typically follow the noun they modify.

Example:
**ເຮືອນຫຼັງໃຫຍ່** [hɯ́ːn lǎŋ ɲàj]
"big house" (literally "house classifier big")

### Comparatives and Superlatives

Comparatives are formed using **ກວ່າ** [kwàː] "more than," while superlatives use **ທີ່ສຸດ** [tʰîː sút] "most."

Example:
**ໃຫຍ່ກວ່າ** [ɲàj kwàː] "bigger"
**ໃຫຍ່ທີ່ສຸດ** [ɲàj tʰîː sút] "biggest"

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed by placing **ບໍ່** [bɔ̀ː] before the verb or adjective.

Example:
**ຂ້ອຍບໍ່ກິນຊີ້ນ** [kʰɔ̂ːj bɔ̀ː kìn sîːn]
"I don't eat meat"

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the particle **ບໍ່** [bɔ̀ː] at the end of a statement.

Example:
**ເຈົ້າກິນເຂົ້າແລ້ວບໍ່?** [tɕâo kìn kʰâo lɛ́ːw bɔ̀ː]
"Have you eaten yet?"

Wh-questions use question words such as:

- **ຫຍັງ** [ɲǎŋ] "what"
- **ໃຜ** [pʰǎj] "who"
- **ຢູ່ໃສ** [jùː sǎj] "where"
- **ເມື່ອໃດ** [mɯ̂a dàj] "when"
- **ເປັນຫຍັງ** [pén ɲǎŋ] "why"

Example:
**ເຈົ້າຊື່ຫຍັງ?** [tɕâo sɯ̄ː ɲǎŋ]
"What is your name?"

## Dialects

Lao has several regional dialects, with the main distinction being between Vientiane Lao (the standard variety) and other regional varieties. Some notable dialects include:

1. Vientiane Lao: The standard dialect, spoken in and around the capital city.
2. Northern Lao: Spoken in northern Laos, with influences from Tai languages.
3. Southern Lao: Spoken in southern Laos, sharing similarities with northeastern Thai dialects.
4. Luang Prabang Lao: Spoken in the former royal capital, known for its distinct tonal system.

Example of dialectal differences:

Standard Lao: **ເຮັດຫຍັງ** [hét ɲǎŋ] "What are you doing?"
Southern Lao: **ເຮັດຫຍັງຢູ່** [hét ɲǎŋ jùː] "What are you doing?"

## Colloquial Lao

Colloquial Lao often differs from the formal written language in several ways:

1. Particle usage: Colloquial speech uses more particles for emphasis and mood.
   Example: **ກິນເຂົ້າແລ້ວບໍ** [kìn kʰâo lɛ́ːw bɔː] "Have you eaten yet?" (formal)
             **ກິນເຂົ້າແລ້ວບໍເດ** [kìn kʰâo lɛ́ːw bɔː dɤː] "Have you eaten yet?" (colloquial)

2. Pronoun dropping: Subjects are often omitted in casual conversation when clear from context.
   Example: **ໄປໃສ?** [paj sǎj] "Where (are you) going?"

3. Contractions: Some words are shortened in casual speech.
   Example: **ບໍ່ແມ່ນ** [bɔ̀ː mɛ̀ːn] → **ບໍ່ມ່ນ** [bɔ̀ː mǎn] "is not"

4. Loanwords: Colloquial Lao incorporates more loanwords, especially from Thai and English.
   Example: **ໂອເຄ** [ʔoː kʰeː] "okay" (from English)

## Idiomatic Expressions

Lao has many idiomatic expressions that reflect cultural values and ways of thinking:

## Honorifics and Politeness

Lao culture places great importance on respect and social hierarchy, which is reflected in the language through honorifics and polite forms:

1. Pronouns: Different pronouns are used based on the social status of the speaker and listener.
   
   Example:
   - **ຂ້ານ້ອຍ** [kʰǎː nɔ̂ːj] - humble "I" used when speaking to monks or royalty
   - **ຂ້າພະເຈົ້າ** [kʰǎː pʰá tɕâo] - formal "I" used in official settings

2. Titles: Titles are often used before names to show respect.
   
   Example:

   - **ອາຈານ** [ʔaː tɕaːn] - Teacher/Professor

3. Particle usage: Particles like **ເດີ** [dɤː] or **ເນາະ** [nɔ́ː] are added to soften statements or requests.
   
   Example:
   **ຂໍໂທດເດີ** [kʰɔ̌ː tʰôːt dɤː] - "Excuse me" (softer than just **ຂໍໂທດ**)

## Verbal Aspect and Modality

While Lao verbs don't conjugate for tense, the language has a rich system of aspect and modality markers:

   Example: **ງາມນໍ** [ŋáːm nɔː] - "It's beautiful, isn't it?"

## Serial Verb Constructions

Lao frequently uses serial verb constructions, where multiple verbs are strung together without conjunctions:

1. **ໄປກິນເຂົ້າ** [paj kìn kʰâo]
   Literal: "go eat rice"
   Meaning: "Go to eat"

2. Pluralization:
   **ເດັກໆ** [dék dék] - "children" (from **ເດັກ** "child")

3. Distributive meaning:
   **ແຕ່ລະໆ** [tɛ̀ː làʔ làʔ] - "each and every" (from **ແຕ່ລະ** "each")

4. Approximation:
   **ແດງໆ** [dɛːŋ dɛːŋ] - "reddish" (from **ແດງ** "red")

## Loanwords

Lao has borrowed words from various languages throughout its history:

1. Pali/Sanskrit (religious and royal terms):
   **ພະ** [pʰáʔ] - "monk" (from Pali "bhikkhu")

2. Khmer (administrative and cultural terms):
   **ກະສັດ** [ká sát] - "king" (from Khmer "kasat")

5. English (technology and modern life):
   **ຄອມພິວເຕີ** [kʰɔːm pʰíw tɤ̀ː] - "computer"

## Writing Conventions

1. Word spacing: Unlike Thai, Lao does not traditionally use spaces between words. However, spaces are used to separate sentences and clauses.

2. Punctuation: Lao traditionally uses only a few punctuation marks:
   - **໌** (cancellation mark) - silences a final consonant
   - **ໆ** (repetition mark) - indicates reduplication
   - **.** (full stop) - adopted from Western punctuation

3. Numerals: Lao has its own numerals, but Arabic numerals are also commonly used:
   Lao: ໐ ໑ ໒ ໓ ໔ ໕ ໖ ໗ ໘ ໙
   Arabic: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

## Discourse Markers

Lao uses various discourse markers to structure conversation:

1. **ແມ່ນແລ້ວ** [mɛ̀ːn lɛ́ːw] - "That's right"
2. **ແນວໃດກໍຕາມ** [nɛ́ːw dàj kɔː taːm] - "However"
3. **ນອກຈາກນັ້ນ** [nɔ̂ːk tɕàːk nán] - "Moreover"
4. **ເພາະສະນັ້ນ** [pʰɔ́ʔ sá nán] - "Therefore"

## Proverbs and Sayings

Lao has many proverbs that reflect cultural wisdom:

1. **ຫມາເຫ່າບໍ່ແມ່ນຫມາກັດ** [mǎː hào bɔ̀ː mɛ̀ːn mǎː kát]
   Literal: "A barking dog is not a biting dog"
   Meaning: Those who talk the most often do the least

2. **ຢ່າຂຸດຂຸມພາງຮັບແຂກ** [jàː kʰút kʰúm pʰáːŋ háp kʰɛ̀ːk]
   Literal: "Don't dig a hole to trap your guests"
   Meaning: Don't set traps for others; it might backfire

3. **ກິນໝາກມ່ວງຫ່າມ ຄອຍກິນໝາກມ່ວງສຸກ** [kìn màːk mùaŋ hàːm kʰɔːj kìn màːk mùaŋ súk]
   Literal: "Eat unripe mangoes, wait to eat ripe mangoes"
   Meaning: Be patient and wait for the right time

These aspects of the Lao language showcase its rich linguistic features, cultural embeddedness, and the complex interplay between formal and colloquial usage. Understanding these elements is crucial for gaining a comprehensive grasp of the language and its use in various contexts.
