# Historical Germanic Linguistics

Historical Germanic linguistics is the study of the development and relationships among the Germanic languages from their Proto-Indo-European origins to the present day. This field encompasses the phonological, morphological, syntactic, and lexical changes that have occurred over time in these languages.

## Proto-Germanic

Proto-Germanic is the hypothetical ancestor of all Germanic languages. It is believed to have been spoken around 500 BCE to 0 CE. While no written records of Proto-Germanic exist, linguists have reconstructed many of its features through the comparative method.

### Phonology

Proto-Germanic underwent several significant sound changes that distinguished it from other Indo-European languages:

1. Grimm's Law (First Germanic Sound Shift): This involved a series of consonant changes:
   - PIE voiceless stops became voiceless fricatives: *p > f, *t > θ, *k > x
   - PIE voiced stops became voiceless stops: *b > p, *d > t, *g > k
   - PIE voiced aspirated stops became voiced stops: *bʰ > b, *dʰ > d, *gʰ > g

   Example:
   PIE **pēd-* "foot" > Proto-Germanic **fōt-* > English **foot**, German **Fuß**, Dutch **voet**

2. Verner's Law: Voiceless fricatives became voiced when the preceding syllable was unstressed in PIE:
   
   Example:
   PIE **bʰreh₂tēr* "brother" > Pre-Germanic **brōþēr* > Proto-Germanic **brōðēr* > English **brother**, German **Bruder**

3. Stress shift: Fixed stress on the first syllable of the root

### Morphology

Proto-Germanic retained many Indo-European morphological features but also developed some unique characteristics:

1. Reduction of PIE eight cases to four: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative

2. Development of weak and strong adjective declensions

3. Simplification of the verb system:
   - Reduction of PIE tenses to present and past
   - Development of strong and weak verb conjugations

4. Creation of dental preterite for weak verbs

Example of a reconstructed Proto-Germanic paradigm:

Strong verb "*nemaną* "to take":

| Person | Present | Past |
|--------|---------|------|
| 1sg    | *nemō   | *nam |
| 2sg    | *nemezi | *namt|
| 3sg    | *nemedi | *nam |
| 1pl    | *nemomaz| *nēmum|
| 2pl    | *nemede | *nēmud|
| 3pl    | *nemandi| *nēmun|

### Lexicon

Proto-Germanic developed a distinct vocabulary, including:

1. Inherited PIE roots:
   ***watōr* "water" (from PIE **wed-*)
   ***fađēr* "father" (from PIE **ph₂tēr*)

2. Germanic innovations:
   ***þingstaz* "thing, assembly" (origin of English "thing")
   ***haimaz* "home" (origin of English "home", German "Heim")

3. Early loanwords:
   ***kuningaz* "king" (possibly from a pre-Germanic substrate)

## Common Germanic Period

After the initial Proto-Germanic period, the language began to diverge into different branches. However, some changes affected all or most Germanic languages during this period:

1. West Germanic gemination: Consonants (except r) were doubled before j
   Example: Proto-Germanic **satjaną* > Old English **settan**, Old High German **sezzen** "to set"

2. Rhotacism: Intervocalic *z became r in West and North Germanic
   Example: Proto-Germanic **ausō* > Old Norse **eyra**, Old English **ēare**, but Gothic **auso** "ear"

3. Loss of final *-z
   Example: Proto-Germanic **dagaz* > Old Norse **dagr**, Old English **dæg**, Gothic **dags** "day"

## Major Germanic Branches

### East Germanic

The East Germanic branch is represented primarily by Gothic, for which we have substantial written records from the 4th century CE.

#### Gothic

Gothic preserves many archaic features of Proto-Germanic:

1. Retention of the fourth principal part in strong verbs
2. Preservation of the dual number in first and second person pronouns
3. Retention of the Proto-Germanic sound *e

Example of Gothic text (from Wulfila's Bible translation, Luke 11:2):

**atta unsar þu in himinam, weihnai namo þein.**
(Our Father, you in heaven, hallowed be your name.)

### North Germanic

North Germanic languages evolved into Old Norse and its descendants.

#### Old Norse

Old Norse was spoken from around 700 to 1350 CE and is the ancestor of modern Scandinavian languages.

Key features:

1. U-umlaut: a > ǫ when u or w followed in the next syllable
   Example: Proto-Germanic **harjaz* > Old Norse **herjr** "army"

2. Breaking: e > ja before a or u in the following syllable
   Example: Proto-Germanic **erþō* > Old Norse **jǫrð** "earth"

3. Syncope: Loss of unstressed vowels
   Example: Proto-Germanic **gastiz* > Old Norse **gestr** "guest"

Example of Old Norse text (from Hávamál):

**Deyr fé, deyja frændr, deyr sjalfr it sama.**
(Cattle die, kinsmen die, the self must also die.)

### West Germanic

West Germanic languages include English, German, Dutch, and Frisian.

#### Old English

Old English was spoken from about 450 to 1150 CE.

Key features:

1. Palatalization: k, g > tʃ, j before front vowels
   Example: Proto-Germanic **kinnu* > Old English **ċinn** "chin"

2. Diphthongization: ā > ēa, ō > ēo
   Example: Proto-Germanic **saiwan* > Old English **sēon** "to see"

3. I-mutation: Back vowels were fronted when i or j followed in the next syllable
   Example: Proto-Germanic **mūs* / **mūsiz* > Old English **mūs** / **mȳs** "mouse/mice"

Example of Old English text (from Beowulf):

**Hwæt! We Gardena in geardagum, þeodcyninga, þrym gefrunon.**
(Lo, we have heard of the glory of the Spear-Danes, of the kings of the people, in the days of yore.)

#### Old High German

Old High German was spoken from about 750 to 1050 CE.

Key features:

1. High German Consonant Shift:
   p > pf/ff, t > ts/ss, k > kx/xx
   Example: Proto-Germanic **applu* > Old High German **apful** "apple"

2. Retention of Proto-Germanic *ai and *au as diphthongs
   Example: Proto-Germanic **stainaz* > Old High German **stein** "stone"

3. Weakening of unstressed vowels
   Example: Proto-Germanic **habjaną* > Old High German **habēn** "to have"

Example of Old High German text (from the Hildebrandslied):

**Ik gihorta ðat seggen, ðat sih urhettun ænon muotin.**
(I heard it said that warriors met in single combat.)

## Major Sound Changes

### Umlaut

Umlaut is a type of vowel mutation where a vowel is influenced by a vowel or semivowel in a following syllable. Different types of umlaut occurred in various Germanic languages:

1. I-umlaut (i-mutation):
   Old English: **fōt** / **fēt** "foot/feet"
   Old Norse: **fótr** / **fœtr** "foot/feet"
   Old High German: **fuoz** / **füezi** "foot/feet"

2. U-umlaut:
   Old Norse: **land** / **lǫnd** "land/lands"

3. A-umlaut:
   Old English: **helpan** > **healp** "to help" / "helped"

### Breaking

Breaking is the diphthongization of vowels under certain conditions:

Old English: **e** > **eo** before **r**, **l**, **h** + consonant
Example: Proto-Germanic **erþō* > Old English **eorþe** "earth"

Old Norse: **e** > **ja** before **a**, **u** in the following syllable
Example: Proto-Germanic **etaną* > Old Norse **jata** "to eat"

### Syncope and Apocope

Syncope is the loss of an internal unstressed vowel, while apocope is the loss of a final unstressed vowel:

Old English syncope: **hēafudes** > **hēafdes** "of the head"
Old Norse apocope: Proto-Germanic **gastiz* > Old Norse **gestr** "guest"

## Morphological Developments

### Noun Declensions

Germanic languages generally simplified the complex PIE noun declension system:

Old English noun declension (strong masculine a-stem):

| Case      | Singular | Plural |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nominative| stān     | stānas |
| Accusative| stān     | stānas |
| Genitive  | stānes   | stāna  |
| Dative    | stāne    | stānum |

### Verb Conjugations

Germanic languages developed a system of strong and weak verbs:

1. Strong verbs: Formed the past tense through ablaut (vowel gradation)
   Example (Old English): **singan** (sing) - **sang** (sang) - **sungon** (sang, plural) - **sungen** (sung)

2. Weak verbs: Formed the past tense with a dental suffix
   Example (Old English): **hīeran** (hear) - **hīerde** (heard)

### Development of Articles

Germanic languages gradually developed definite and indefinite articles from demonstrative pronouns and the numeral "one":

Old English: No articles
Middle English: **the** (definite), **a/an** (indefinite)

Old High German: No articles
Middle High German: **der/diu/daz** (definite), **ein** (indefinite)

## Syntax

### Word Order

Germanic languages show a trend from SOV to SVO word order:

Old English: Generally SOV in subordinate clauses
**Æfter þæm þe Romeburg getimbred wæs .iiii. hunde wintra & .xxvi.**
(After Rome was built 426 years)

Modern English: SVO
**After Rome was built 426 years**

### V2 Word Order

Many Germanic languages developed V2 (verb-second) word order in main clauses:

German:
**Gestern ging ich ins Kino.**
(Yesterday went I to-the cinema)

Swedish:
**Igår gick jag på bio.**
(Yesterday went I to cinema)

### Periphrastic Constructions

Germanic languages developed various periphrastic constructions:

1. Perfect tense:
   English: **I have gone**
   German: **Ich bin gegangen**

2. Progressive aspect:
   English: **I am going**
   Dutch: **Ik ben aan het gaan**

3. Future tense:
   English: **I will go**
   German: **Ich werde gehen**

## Lexical Developments

### Semantic Shifts

Many Proto-Germanic words underwent semantic shifts in daughter languages:

Proto-Germanic ***drankijaną* "to give to drink" > English **drench**, German **tränken** "to water (animals)"

### Compound Words

Germanic languages are known for their ability to form compound words:

Old English: **bōc-hūs** "book-house" (library)
German: **Schadenfreude** "harm-joy" (pleasure derived from another's misfortune)

### Loanwords

Germanic languages borrowed extensively from other languages:

1. Latin influence:
   Old English: **strǣt** (street) < Latin **strata via**
   German: **Fenster** (window) < Latin **fenestra**

2. French influence (especially in English after 1066):
   English: **beef**, **pork**, **mutton**

3. Old Norse influence on English:
   **sky**, **skin**, **they**

## Dialectal Continuum

Before standardization, Germanic languages existed in a dialectal continuum. For example, Old Saxon (ancestor of Low German) shared features with both Old English and Old High German:

Old Saxon: **that** (that)
Old English: **þæt**
Old High German: **daz**

## Runic Inscriptions

The earliest Germanic texts are runic inscriptions dating from around 150 CE. The Elder Futhark was the oldest runic alphabet:

ᚠᚢᚦᚨᚱᚲᚷᚹᚺᚾᛁᛃᛇᛈᛉᛊᛏᛒᛖᛗᛚᛜᛞᛟ

Example of a runic inscription (Thorsberg chape, c. 200 CE):

**ᛟᚹᛚᚦᚢᚦᛖᚹᚨᛉ**
Transliteration: **owlþuþewaz**
Meaning: "servant of Ullr (a god)"

## Gothic Bible Translation

The Gothic Bible translation by Wulfila (4th century CE) is the earliest substantial text in a Germanic language:

Gothic Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:9-13):

**atta unsar þu in himinam,
weihnai namo þein.
qimai þiudinassus þeins.
wairþai wilja þeins,
swe in himina jah ana airþai.
hlaif unsarana þana sinteinan gif uns himma daga.
jah aflet uns þatei skulans sijaima,
swaswe jah weis afletam þaim skulam unsaraim.
jah ni briggais uns in fraistubnjai,
ak lausei uns af þamma ubilin;
unte þeina ist þiudangardi jah mahts jah wulþus in aiwins.**
