# Tamazight (Berber)

Tamazight (ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ), also known as Berber, is a family of closely related languages indigenous to North Africa. The Tamazight languages are spoken by various Berber ethnic groups across Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, northern Mali, western and northern Niger, and northern Burkina Faso. The total number of speakers is estimated to be between 30 and 40 million.

## Classification and Varieties

Tamazight belongs to the Afroasiatic language family. The main varieties of Tamazight include:

1. Tashelhiyt (ⵜⴰⵛⵍⵃⵉⵜ): Spoken in southern Morocco
2. Central Atlas Tamazight (ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ ⵏ ⵡⴰⵟⵍⴰⵙ): Spoken in central Morocco
3. Kabyle (ⵜⴰⵇⴱⴰⵢⵍⵉⵜ): Spoken in northern Algeria
4. Riffian (ⵜⴰⵔⵉⴼⵉⵜ): Spoken in northern Morocco
5. Tuareg (ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵌⴰⵆ): Spoken across the Sahara (southern Algeria, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso)
6. Zenaga (ⵜⵓⴹⴹⵓⵏⴳⵉⵢⴰ): Spoken in Mauritania
7. Siwi (ⵜⴰⵙⵉⵡⵉⵜ): Spoken in the Siwa Oasis in Egypt
8. Nafusi (ⵜⴰⵏⴼⵓⵙⵉⵜ): Spoken in western Libya
9. Ghadamès (ⵜⴰⵖⴷⴰⵎⵙⵉⵜ): Spoken in Ghadamès, Libya
10. Awjila (ⵜⴰⵡⵊⵉⵍⵉⵜ): Spoken in eastern Libya

While these varieties are sometimes referred to as dialects, they can be mutually unintelligible and are often considered separate languages.

## Writing Systems

Historically, Tamazight has been written in various scripts:

1. Tifinagh (ⵜⵉⴼⵉⵏⴰⵖ): An ancient script indigenous to North Africa
2. Arabic script (ﺍﻟﺨﻂ ﺍﻟﻌﺮﺑﻲ): Adopted after the spread of Islam
3. Latin script: Introduced during European colonization

Modern standardization efforts have led to the adoption of:

4. Neo-Tifinagh (ⵜⵉⴼⵉⵏⴰⵖ ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵢⵏⵓⵜ): A modernized version of the ancient Tifinagh script
5. Standard Moroccan Amazigh alphabet: A Latin-based script

### Tifinagh

The ancient Tifinagh script is believed to have descended from the Phoenician alphabet. Modern Neo-Tifinagh was developed in the 20th century and is now officially used in Morocco. Here's the Neo-Tifinagh alphabet:

ⴰ (a), ⴱ (b), ⴳ (g), ⴷ (d), ⴹ (ḍ), ⴻ (e), ⴼ (f), ⴽ (k), ⵀ (h), ⵃ (ḥ), ⵄ (ε), ⵅ (x), ⵇ (q), ⵉ (i), ⵊ (j), ⵍ (l), ⵎ (m), ⵏ (n), ⵓ (u), ⵔ (r), ⵕ (ṛ), ⵖ (γ), ⵙ (s), ⵚ (ṣ), ⵛ (c), ⵜ (t), ⵟ (ṭ), ⵡ (w), ⵢ (y), ⵣ (z), ⵥ (ẓ)

Examples in Neo-Tifinagh:
**ⴰⵙⵍⵎⴷ** (aselmad) - “teacher”
**ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ** (tamaziɣt) - “Tamazight language”
**ⴰⵙⵙ** (ass) - “day”
**ⵜⴰⴼⵓⴽⵜ** (tafukt) - “sun”
**ⵉⵖⴼ** (iɣf) - “head”
**ⵜⴰⵎⵟⵟⵓⵜ** (tamṭṭut) - “woman”

### Latin-based Script

The Latin-based script is widely used, especially in Algeria and for Kabyle. Here's an example of the Standard Moroccan Amazigh alphabet:

a, b, c, d, ḍ, e, f, g, ǧ, h, ḥ, i, j, k, l, m, n, q, r, ṛ, s, ṣ, t, ṭ, u, w, x, y, z, ẓ, ɛ, ɣ

Examples in Latin script:
**azwu** (ⴰⵣⵡⵓ) - “wind”
**tafukt** (ⵜⴰⴼⵓⴽⵜ) - “sun”
**iḍ** (ⵉⴹ) - “night”

### Arabic-based Script

In some regions, particularly in older texts, Tamazight has been written using the Arabic script. This system is called Ajami. While less common today, it's still used in some traditional and religious contexts.

Example in Arabic script:
**اَمَان** (aman, ⴰⵎⴰⵏ) - “water”

## Phonology

Tamazight phonology varies across different varieties, but some common features include:

### Consonants

Tamazight languages typically have a rich consonant inventory, including:

1. Emphatic consonants: ḍ (ⴹ), ṭ (ⵟ), ṣ (ⵚ), ẓ (ⵥ)
2. Pharyngeal consonants: ḥ (ⵃ), ɛ (ⵄ)
3. Labialized consonants: kʷ, gʷ, xʷ, qʷ
4. Uvular consonants: q (ⵇ), ɣ (ⵖ)
5. Fricatives: f (ⴼ), s (ⵙ), z (ⵣ), ʃ (ⵛ), ʒ (ⵊ), x (ⵅ), ɣ (ⵖ)

Examples:
**ⴹⴰⵔ** (ḍar) [ḍar] - “foot”
**ⴰⵖⵔⵓⵎ** (aɣrum) [aʁrum] - “bread”
**ⵜⴰⵅⵙⴰⵢⵜ** (taxsayt) [taxsajt] - “pumpkin”

### Vowels

Most Tamazight varieties have a three-vowel system:

- a (ⴰ) [æ~ɑ]
- i (ⵉ) [i]
- u (ⵓ) [u]

Some varieties, like Kabyle, also include:

- e (ⴻ) [ə]

Examples:
**ⴰⵎⴰⵏ** (aman) [aman] - “water”
**ⵉⵎⵉ** (imi) [imi] - “mouth”
**ⵓⵍ** (ul) [ul] - “heart”

In Kabyle:
**ⴰⵎⴻⵇⵇⵔⴰⵏ** (ameqqran) [aməqqran] - “big”

### Phonological Processes

1. Assimilation: Consonants often assimilate in voicing or place of articulation.

Example (Kabyle):
**ⴰⴷ ⵢⴻⵛⵛ** (ad yečč) → [aʝəʧ] - “he will eat”

2. Vowel syncope: Short vowels may be deleted in certain environments.

Example (Tashelhiyt):
**ⵉⴼⵓⵍⴽⵉ** (ifulki) → [fulki] - “it is good”

3. Consonant clusters: Tamazight allows complex consonant clusters, especially in Tashelhiyt.

Example (Tashelhiyt):
**ⵜⵙⵙⴽⵛⴼⵜⵙⵜⵜ** (tsskʃftstt) - “you dried it” (feminine singular)

4. Labialization: Some consonants can be labialized, especially before rounded vowels.

Example (Central Atlas Tamazight):
**ⴰⴽⵯⴼⴰⵢ** (akʷfay) - “milk”

## Morphology

Tamazight languages are known for their rich morphology, particularly in the verbal system.

### Nouns

Nouns in Tamazight have two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural).

1. Gender:
   - Masculine nouns often begin with a- (ⴰ-) or i- (ⵉ-)

## Syntax

Tamazight languages typically follow a VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order, although other orders are possible for emphasis or in specific constructions.

1. Basic Sentence Structure:

Example (Kabyle):
**ⵢⴻⵛⵛⴰ ⵡⴻⵔⴳⴰⵣ ⴰⵖⵔⵓⵎ**
(yečča wergaz aɣrum)
ate man bread
“The man ate bread”

2. Question Formation:
   Questions are often formed by intonation or by using question particles.

Example (Central Atlas Tamazight):
**ⵉⵙ ⵜⵔⵉⵜ ⴰⵜⴰⵢ?**
(is trit atay?)
Q want-you tea
“Do you want tea?”

3. Negation:
   Negation typically involves a discontinuous morpheme.

Example (Tashelhiyt):
**ⵓⵔ ⵉⴼⴼⵓⵖ (ⵛⴰ)**
(ur iffuɣ (ša))
NEG go.out.PFV.3SG.M (NEG)
“He didn't go out”

4. Relative Clauses:
   Relative clauses are often introduced by a relative pronoun.

Example (Kabyle):
**ⴰⵔⴳⴰⵣ ⵉ ⵡⴰⵍⴰⵖ ⵉⴹⴻⵍⵍⵉ**
(argaz i walaɣ iḍelli)
man REL see.PFV.1SG yesterday
“The man whom I saw yesterday”

5. Construct State:
   When a noun is the subject of a verb or follows certain prepositions, it appears in the construct state.

Example (Central Atlas Tamazight):
**ⵢⵓⵙⴰ ⵡⵔⴳⴰⵣ** (yusa wrgaz) (construct state)
came man
“The man came”

Compare with:
**ⴰⵔⴳⴰⵣ** (argaz) (free state)
“a man”
