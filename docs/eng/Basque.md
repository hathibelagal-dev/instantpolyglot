# Basque

Basque, known as **euskara** in the language itself, is a language isolate spoken by approximately 750,000 people, primarily in the Basque Country (Euskal Herria), which spans parts of northern Spain and southwestern France. It is not related to any other known living language, making it unique among European languages. Basque is official in the Basque Autonomous Community and parts of Navarre in Spain.

## Dialects

Basque has several dialects, traditionally grouped into eight main varieties:

1. Bizkaiera (Biscayan)
2. Gipuzkera (Gipuzkoan)
3. Lapurtera (Lapurdian)
4. Zuberera (Souletin)
5. Nafarrera Garaia (High Navarrese)
6. Nafarrera Beherea (Low Navarrese)
7. Erronkariera (Roncalese) - extinct since 1991
8. Zaraitzuera (Salazarese) - critically endangered

However, in 1968, the Basque Language Academy (Euskaltzaindia) began the process of creating a standardized Basque, known as **Euskara Batua** (Unified Basque). This standard is now widely used in education, media, and official documents.

## Phonology and Orthography

### Vowels

Basque has a five-vowel system:

| Vowel | IPA | Example |
|-------|-----|---------|
| a | [a] | **ama** [ˈama] (mother) |
| e | [e] | **etxe** [eˈtʃe] (house) |
| i | [i] | **ibili** [iˈβili] (to walk) |
| o | [o] | **ondo** [ˈondo] (well, good) |
| u | [u] | **ume** [ˈume] (child) |

### Consonants

Basque consonants include:

| Consonant | IPA | Example |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| b | [b] | **bai** [baj] (yes) |
| d | [d] | **denbora** [denˈboɾa] (time) |
| f | [f] | **familia** [faˈmilia] (family) |
| g | [g] | **gau** [gaw] (night) |
| h | [h] | **hartu** [ˈhaɾtu] (to take) |
| k | [k] | **katu** [ˈkatu] (cat) |
| l | [l] | **lan** [lan] (work) |
| m | [m] | **mendi** [ˈmendi] (mountain) |
| n | [n] | **nahi** [naj] (want) |
| p | [p] | **paper** [paˈper] (paper) |
| r | [ɾ], [r] | **ura** [ˈuɾa] (water), **erreka** [eˈreka] (stream) |
| s | [s̺] | **sagu** [ˈs̺aɣu] (mouse) |
| t | [t] | **etorri** [eˈtori] (to come) |
| x | [ʃ] | **xagu** [ˈʃaɣu] (mouse, dialectal) |
| z | [s̻] | **zer** [s̻er] (what) |
| tz | [ts̻] | **hitz** [hits̻] (word) |
| ts | [ts̺] | **untsa** [unts̺a] (well, dialectal) |
| tx | [tʃ] | **etxe** [eˈtʃe] (house) |

Note that 'r' is pronounced as a tap [ɾ] between vowels and as a trill [r] in other positions.

### Stress

Stress in standard Basque generally falls on the second syllable from the right in most native words:

- **etxea** [eˈtʃea] (the house)
- **euskara** [eus̺ˈkaɾa] (Basque language)

However, there are exceptions and dialectal variations.

### Phonological processes

1. Final -a: Many Basque words end in -a, which is often (but not always) the definite article. When adding suffixes, this -a may disappear:
   - **etxe** (house) + -a → **etxea** (the house)
   - **etxea** + -n (locative) → **etxean** (in the house), not *etxeaan

2. Voicing alternation: Voiceless stops become voiced between vowels:
   - **etorri** (to come) + -ko (future) → **etorriko** [etoˈrigo] (will come)

3. Palatalization: In some dialects, /n/, /l/, and /t/ can become palatalized after /i/:
   - **hil** [hil] (to die) → **hilik** [hiʎik] (dead)

## Morphology

Basque is an agglutinative language with a rich system of suffixes and postpositions.

### Nouns

Basque nouns are not marked for gender. The definite article -a (and its plural -ak) is often attached to nouns:

- **etxe** (house) → **etxea** (the house)
- **etxeak** (the houses)

Nouns are declined for case, with numerous cases including:

1. Absolutive (ABS): unmarked, used for intransitive subjects and direct objects
2. Ergative (ERG): -k, used for transitive subjects
3. Dative (DAT): -i, indirect object
4. Genitive (GEN): -ren, possession
5. Locative (LOC): -n, location
6. Ablative (ABL): -tik, movement from
7. Allative (ALL): -ra, movement to
8. Instrumental (INS): -z, means or instrument

Example with **etxe** (house):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| ABS | etxea | etxeak |
| ERG | etxeak | etxeek |
| DAT | etxeari | etxeei |
| GEN | etxearen | etxeen |
| LOC | etxean | etxeetan |
| ABL | etxetik | etxeetatik |
| ALL | etxera | etxeetara |
| INS | etxeaz | etxeez |

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Basque:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | ni | gu |
| 2nd (familiar) | hi | - |
| 2nd (polite) | zu | zuek |
| 3rd | hura | haiek |

Pronouns are declined for case like nouns. For example, **ni** (I):

- Absolutive: **ni**
- Ergative: **nik**
- Dative: **niri**
- Genitive: **nire** / **neure**

### Demonstratives

Basque has a three-way demonstrative system:

- **hau** (this, near the speaker)
- **hori** (that, near the listener)
- **hura** (that, far from both)

These are also declined for case and number:

| Case | hau (sg) | hauek (pl) |
|------|----------|------------|
| ABS | hau | hauek |
| ERG | honek | hauek |
| DAT | honi | hauei |
| GEN | honen | hauen |

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Basque typically follow the noun they modify and agree in number and case:

- **etxe handia** (the big house)
- **etxe handiak** (the big houses, ABS/ERG)
- **etxe handiei** (to the big houses, DAT)

Comparative and superlative forms:

- Comparative: -ago
  - **handi** (big) → **handiago** (bigger)
- Superlative: -en
  - **handi** (big) → **handien** (biggest)

Example: **Etxe hau handiagoa da** (This house is bigger)

### Numbers

Cardinal numbers:

- 0: **zero**
- 1: **bat**
- 2: **bi**
- 3: **hiru**
- 4: **lau**
- 5: **bost**
- 6: **sei**
- 7: **zazpi**
- 8: **zortzi**
- 9: **bederatzi**
- 10: **hamar**
- 11: **hamaika**
- 20: **hogei**
- 100: **ehun**
- 1000: **mila**

Numbers usually precede the noun: **bost etxe** (five houses)

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding -garren:
- **lehen** (first) (irregular)
- **bigarren** (second)
- **hirugarren** (third)

### Verbs

Basque verbs have a complex system with numerous forms. There are two main types of conjugation:

1. Synthetic: A small number of common verbs can be conjugated directly.
2. Periphrastic: Most verbs use auxiliary verbs for conjugation.

#### Synthetic verbs

Examples of synthetically conjugated verbs in present tense:

**joan** (to go):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | noa | goaz |
| 2nd (familiar) | hoa | - |
| 2nd (polite) | zoaz | zoazte |
| 3rd | doa | doaz |

**egon** (to be, to stay):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | nago | gaude |
| 2nd (familiar) | hago | - |
| 2nd (polite) | zaude | zaudete |
| 3rd | dago | daude |

#### Periphrastic verbs

Most Basque verbs are conjugated periphrastically, using an auxiliary verb. The two main auxiliaries are:

- **izan** (to be) for intransitive verbs
- **ukan** / **edun** (to have) for transitive verbs

The main verb appears in a participial form, and the auxiliary carries person, number, tense, and mood information.

Example with **etorri** (to come) in present tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | etortzen naiz | etortzen gara |
| 2nd (familiar) | etortzen haiz | - |
| 2nd (polite) | etortzen zara | etortzen zarete |
| 3rd | etortzen da | etortzen dira |

Example with **ikusi** (to see) in present tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | ikusten dut | ikusten dugu |
| 2nd (familiar) | ikusten duk/n | - |
| 2nd (polite) | ikusten duzu | ikusten duzue |
| 3rd | ikusten du | ikusten dute |

#### Aspect and tense

Basque verbs distinguish three main aspects:

1. Imperfective: -t(z)en
   - **egiten dut** (I do, I am doing)
2. Perfective: -tu/-du/-i/-n
   - **egin dut** (I have done, I did)
3. Prospective: -ko/-go
   - **egingo dut** (I will do)

These combine with tense markers on the auxiliary to form various tenses:

- Present: **egiten dut** (I do)
- Past: **egiten nuen** (I was doing)
- Future: **egingo dut** (I will do)

#### Mood

Basque verbs can express various moods:

1. Indicative: as shown above
2. Potential: use of auxiliary **ahal izan**
   - **egin dezaket** (I can do)
3. Conditional: -ko/-go + conditional auxiliary
   - **egingo nuke** (I would do)
4. Imperative: specific forms
   - **egizu!** (do it! - polite singular)
   - **egin ezazue!** (do it! - polite plural)
5. Subjunctive: used in subordinate clauses
   - **egin dezadan nahi du** (he/she wants me to do it)

### Allocutive forms

A unique feature of Basque is its allocutive verb forms, which encode the gender of the person being addressed (when that person is not a participant in the action). This is used in informal speech:

- **Lanean ari nauk** (I am working - speaking to a male)
- **Lanean ari naun** (I am working - speaking to a female)

## Syntax

Basque is known for its ergative-absolutive alignment and its relatively flexible word order, with SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) being the most common.

### Ergativity

In an ergative-absolutive system, the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are marked the same (absolutive case), while the subject of a transitive verb is marked differently (ergative case):

- **Gizona etorri da** (The man has come) - gizona is in absolutive case
- **Gizonak ogia jan du** (The man has eaten the bread) - gizonak is in ergative case, ogia in absolutive

### Word order

While SOV is the most common word order, other orders are possible for emphasis or in certain constructions:

- SOV: **Gizonak ogia jan du** (The man has eaten the bread)
- OSV: **Ogia gizonak jan du** (It's the bread that the man has eaten)
- SVO: **Gizonak jan du ogia** (The man has eaten it, the bread)

### Postpositions

Basque uses postpositions rather than prepositions:

- **etxearen aurrean** (in front of the house)
- **mahairen gainean** (on top of the table)

### Questions

Questions can be formed by:

1. Using question words:
   - **Nor** (who): **Nor da?** (Who is it?)
   - **Zer** (what): **Zer nahi duzu?** (What do you want?)
   - **Non** (where): **Non bizi zara?** (Where do you live?)
   - **Noiz** (when): **Noiz etorriko zara?** (When will you come?)

2. Using the particle **al**:
   - **Etorriko al zara?** (Will you come?)

3. Intonation alone:
   - **Etorriko zara?** (You will come? / Will you come?)

### Negation

Negation is typically formed by placing **ez** before the verb:

- **Ez dakit** (I don't know)
- **Ez dut ulertzen** (I don't understand)

In compound tenses, **ez** comes before the auxiliary:

- **Ez dut ikusi** (I haven't seen it)

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses in Basque are formed by adding the suffix -n to the verb, which then precedes the noun it modifies:

- **Ikusi dudan gizona** (The man whom I have seen)
- **Erosi dudan liburua** (The book that I have bought)

### Causative

Causatives are formed with the suffix -arazi:

- **egin** (to do) → **eginarazi** (to make someone do)
- **Lana eginarazi dit** (He/she made me do the work)

### Potential

The potential mood, expressing ability or possibility, is formed with the auxiliary **ahal izan**:

- **Etorri ahal naiz** (I can come)
- **Egin ahal duzu?** (Can you do it?)

In the past tense, the potential is expressed with the suffix -ke:

- **Etor nintekeen** (I could have come)
- **Egin zezakeen** (He/she could have done it)

### Reported speech

Basque uses the suffix -(e)la for reported speech:

- Direct: **Mikelek esan du: "Bihar etorriko naiz"** (Mikel said: "I will come tomorrow")
- Indirect: **Mikelek esan du bihar etorriko dela** (Mikel said that he will come tomorrow)

For reported questions, -(e)n is used:

- **Mikelek galdetu du ea etorriko naizen** (Mikel asked if I will come)

## Vocabulary

Basque vocabulary is largely unique, though it has borrowed words from neighboring languages throughout its history. Some common sources of loanwords include:

1. Latin and Romance languages (especially Spanish and French):
   - **liburu** (book) from Latin "librum"
   - **leiho** (window) from Latin "fenestra"

2. Germanic languages:
   - **borda** (hut, cabin) from Frankish "borda"

3. Arabic (via Spanish):
   - **azoka** (market) from Arabic "as-suq"

4. Modern loans from English and other languages:
   - **futbola** (football/soccer)
   - **ordenagailu** (computer)

### Word formation

Basque has several productive methods of word formation:

1. Compounding:
   - **surburu** (source) from **sur** (nose) + **buru** (head)
   - **itsasgizon** (sailor) from **itsas** (sea) + **gizon** (man)

2. Derivation with prefixes and suffixes:
   - **-tasun** (creates abstract nouns): **edertasun** (beauty) from **eder** (beautiful)
   - **-garri** (creates adjectives): **interesgarri** (interesting) from **interes** (interest)
   - **-gile** (creator, maker): **idazle** (writer) from **idatzi** (to write)

### Common expressions

- Greetings:
  - **Kaixo** (Hello)
  - **Agur** (Goodbye)
  - **Egun on** (Good morning)
  - **Arratsalde on** (Good afternoon)
  - **Gabon** (Good night)

- Politeness:
  - **Mesedez** (Please)
  - **Eskerrik asko** (Thank you very much)
  - **Barkatu** (Excuse me / Sorry)

- Useful phrases:
  - **Euskaraz ba al dakizu?** (Do you speak Basque?)
  - **Ez dut ulertzen** (I don't understand)
  - **Nola duzu izena?** (What's your name?)
  - **Nire izena ... da** (My name is ...)

## Dialects and Euskara Batua

While Euskara Batua (Unified Basque) is the standardized form used in education, media, and official contexts, the various dialects of Basque remain important in everyday life in many Basque-speaking areas.

Some notable differences between dialects:

1. Vocabulary:
   - "duck": **ahate** (standard), **paita** (Bizkaian), **gita** (Zuberoan)

2. Verb forms:
   - "I am": **naiz** (standard), **naz** (Bizkaian)

3. Pronunciation:
   - The letter 'j' is pronounced [x] in standard Basque, but [ʝ] in some western dialects and [ʒ] in some eastern dialects.

4. Use of allocutive forms:
   - More common in rural areas and certain dialects, less used in urban areas and standard Basque.

### Dialect continuum

The traditional Basque dialects form a continuum, with neighboring dialects being mutually intelligible but more distant ones potentially causing communication difficulties. The creation of Euskara Batua has helped to bridge these gaps and create a common standard for all Basque speakers.

## Writing system

Basque uses the Latin alphabet, with the following 27 letters:

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Ñ, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Note that 'C', 'Ñ', 'Q', 'V', 'W', and 'Y' are only used in borrowed words and names.

Additionally, Basque uses several digraphs:

- dd, ll, rr, ts, tt, tx, tz

Historically, other writing systems have been used for Basque, including:

1. Aquitanian inscriptions (1st-3rd centuries CE), believed to represent an early form of Basque.
2. Various attempts to create a uniquely Basque alphabet in the 20th century, such as the Souletin txiberta alphabet.

## Linguistic features

### Pro-drop

Basque is a pro-drop language, meaning that pronouns can be omitted when they can be inferred from context:

- **Etxera noa** (I'm going home) - the pronoun "ni" (I) is omitted

### Animacy

Basque makes a distinction between animate and inanimate objects in some contexts. For example, the question words "nor" (who) and "zer" (what) are used for animate and inanimate subjects/objects respectively:

- **Nor etorri da?** (Who has come?)
- **Zer gertatu da?** (What has happened?)

### Inclusive and exclusive "we"

Unlike many European languages, Basque distinguishes between inclusive "we" (including the addressee) and exclusive "we" (excluding the addressee):

- **gu** (we, general)
- **gu denok** (we all, inclusive)
- **guk geuk** (we ourselves, exclusive)

### Basque-only features

Some linguistic features are believed to be unique to Basque or very rare among world languages:

1. Ergative-absolutive alignment combined with subject-object-verb word order.
2. The allocutive system, which encodes the gender of the addressee in verb forms.
3. A vigesimal (base-20) number system, especially evident in traditional dialects.

## Influence on other languages

Despite its isolation, Basque has had some influence on neighboring languages:

1. Spanish:
   - Words like "izquierda" (left) from Basque "ezker"
   - The sound [θ] (spelled 'z' in Spanish) may have originated from Basque influence

2. Gascon (a dialect of Occitan):
   - Aspirated consonants, unusual in Romance languages
   - Some vocabulary items

3. Aragonese:
   - Some phonological features and vocabulary in northern dialects

## Language revival efforts

Basque has undergone significant revitalization efforts since the mid-20th century:

1. Creation of Euskara Batua (Unified Basque) in 1968
2. Establishment of ikastolas (Basque-medium schools)
3. Basque-language media, including TV channels, radio stations, and newspapers
4. Official status and governmental support in the Basque Autonomous Community and parts of Navarre

These efforts have led to an increase in the number of Basque speakers, particularly among younger generations.

## Linguistic classification attempts

While Basque is considered a language isolate, there have been numerous attempts to link it to other languages or language families:

1. Vasco-Iberian hypothesis: Proposes a connection with the extinct Iberian language
2. Dene-Caucasian hypothesis: Suggests links with Caucasian, Sino-Tibetan, and Na-Dene languages
3. Vasco-Aquitanian hypothesis: Connects Basque with the ancient Aquitanian language

However, none of these hypotheses have gained widespread acceptance in the linguistic community, and Basque remains classified as an isolate.
