# Aramaic

Aramaic is a Semitic language family with a history spanning over 3,000 years. It originated among the Arameans in the ancient Near East and has been used as a lingua franca in various forms throughout history. Today, several modern Aramaic languages are still spoken by small communities, primarily in the Middle East.

## Writing Systems

Aramaic has been written using several scripts throughout its history. The most common are:

1. Imperial Aramaic script (from 8th century BCE)
2. Hebrew square script (from 3rd century BCE)
3. Syriac script (from 1st century CE)

For this overview, we will use the Hebrew square script for examples, with romanization provided.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Aramaic consonants vary slightly depending on the specific dialect or period. Here's a general overview:

| Romanization | Hebrew Script | IPA | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-----|-------------|
| ' | א | [ʔ] | Glottal stop |
| b | ב | [b], [v] | Voiced bilabial stop/fricative |
| g | ג | [ɡ], [ɣ] | Voiced velar stop/fricative |
| d | ד | [d], [ð] | Voiced dental stop/fricative |
| h | ה | [h] | Voiceless glottal fricative |
| w | ו | [w] | Voiced labio-velar approximant |
| z | ז | [z] | Voiced alveolar fricative |
| ḥ | ח | [ħ] | Voiceless pharyngeal fricative |
| ṭ | ט | [tˤ] | Emphatic voiceless dental stop |
| y | י | [j] | Voiced palatal approximant |
| k | כ | [k], [x] | Voiceless velar stop/fricative |
| l | ל | [l] | Voiced alveolar lateral approximant |
| m | מ | [m] | Voiced bilabial nasal |
| n | נ | [n] | Voiced alveolar nasal |
| s | ס | [s] | Voiceless alveolar fricative |
| ' | ע | [ʕ] | Voiced pharyngeal fricative |
| p | פ | [p], [f] | Voiceless bilabial stop/fricative |
| ṣ | צ | [sˤ] | Emphatic voiceless alveolar fricative |
| q | ק | [q] | Voiceless uvular stop |
| r | ר | [r] | Voiced alveolar trill |
| š | שׁ | [ʃ] | Voiceless postalveolar fricative |
| ś | שׂ | [s] | Voiceless alveolar fricative |
| t | ת | [t], [θ] | Voiceless dental stop/fricative |

Note: The exact pronunciation of some consonants varied over time and between dialects.

### Vowels

In the Hebrew square script, vowels are typically not written (except for long vowels represented by matres lectionis). The Tiberian vocalization system, developed in the 8th century CE, provides diacritical marks for vowels:

| Romanization | Hebrew Script | IPA | Description |
|--------------|---------------|-----|-------------|
| a | ַ | [a] | Open front unrounded vowel |
| ā | ָ | [ɔ] | Open-mid back rounded vowel |
| e | ֶ | [ɛ] | Open-mid front unrounded vowel |
| ē | ֵ | [e] | Close-mid front unrounded vowel |
| i | ִ | [i] | Close front unrounded vowel |
| o | ֹ | [o] | Close-mid back rounded vowel |
| u | ֻ | [u] | Close back rounded vowel |
| ə | ְ | [ə] | Mid central vowel (schwa) |

Example: **בְּרֵאשִׁית** (bərēšīṯ) [bəreːˈʃiːθ] "in the beginning"

## Morphology

Aramaic, like other Semitic languages, uses a root-and-pattern system for word formation.

### Roots

Most roots consist of three consonants (triconsonantal roots), though some have two or four. The root carries the basic semantic meaning, while different patterns of vowels and affixes create various related words.

Example root: ק-ט-ל (q-ṭ-l) - related to "killing"

### Nouns

Nouns in Aramaic have two genders (masculine and feminine) and three states (absolute, construct, and emphatic).

#### Gender

Masculine nouns typically have no specific ending in the singular:
**מֶלֶךְ** (meleḵ) - "king"

Feminine nouns often end in **-ā** (א-) in the emphatic state:
**מַלְכְּתָא** (malkəṯā) - "queen"

#### Number

Singular: No specific ending for masculine nouns; **-ā** (א-) for feminine nouns
Plural: **-īn** (ין-) for masculine nouns; **-ān** (ן-) for feminine nouns

Example:
- Singular: **סֵפֶר** (sēp̄er) - "book"
- Plural: **סִפְרִין** (sip̄rīn) - "books"

#### States

1. Absolute state: The basic form of the noun
2. Construct state: Used when the noun is in a possessive relationship
3. Emphatic state: Originally used for definiteness, later became the default form in many dialects

Example:
- Absolute: **מֶלֶךְ** (meleḵ) - "king"
- Construct: **מֶלֶךְ** (meleḵ) - "king of"
- Emphatic: **מַלְכָּא** (malkā) - "the king"

### Pronouns

#### Personal Pronouns

### Verbs

Aramaic verbs are based on roots and are inflected for person, number, gender, tense, and stem.

#### Stems

The main verbal stems are:

1. Pə'al (G-stem): Basic stem
2. Pa''el (D-stem): Intensive stem
3. Ap̄'el (C-stem): Causative stem
4. Iṯpə'el (Gt-stem): Reflexive of Pə'al
5. Iṯpa''al (Dt-stem): Reflexive of Pa''el
6. Ittap̄'al (Ct-stem): Reflexive of Ap̄'el

#### Conjugation

Here's an example of the Pə'al stem conjugation for the verb **כְּתַב** (kəṯaḇ) - "to write" in the perfect (past) tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 3rd masc. | **כְּתַב** (kəṯaḇ) | **כְּתַבוּ** (kəṯaḇū) |
| 3rd fem. | **כִּתְבַת** (kiṯḇaṯ) | **כְּתַבָה** (kəṯaḇā) |

| 1st | **כִּתְבֵת** (kiṯḇēṯ) | **כְּתַבְנָא** (kəṯaḇnā) |

#### Participles

Aramaic has active and passive participles, which can function as adjectives or verbal forms:

Active participle: **כָּתֵב** (kāṯēḇ) - "writing"
Passive participle: **כְּתִיב** (kəṯīḇ) - "written"

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Aramaic is typically Verb-Subject-Object (VSO), although other orders are possible for emphasis or in specific constructions.

Example:
**כְּתַב מַלְכָּא אִגַּרְתָּא** (kəṯaḇ malkā 'iggartā)
"The king wrote a letter" (lit. "Wrote the-king a-letter")

### Construct Chain

The construct chain is used to express possession or other close relationships between nouns. The possessed noun (in construct state) comes first, followed by the possessor (in emphatic state):

**בֵּית מַלְכָּא** (bēṯ malkā) - "the king's house" (lit. "house-of the-king")

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by the particle **דִּי** (dī) or **-ד** (-ḏ):

**גַּבְרָא דִּי חֲזֵיתָה** (gaḇrā dī ḥăzēṯāh) - "the man whom I saw"

### Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences typically use the particle **הֵן** (hēn) or **אִן** ('in) for "if":

**הֵן תֵּיתֵי לְבֵיתִי, אֶתֵּן לָךְ מַתְּנָה** (hēn tēṯē lə-ḇēṯī, 'ettēn lāḵ mattnā)
"If you come to my house, I will give you a gift"

## Dialects and Historical Development

Aramaic has a long history with many dialects and stages. Some major divisions include:

1. Old Aramaic (900-700 BCE)
2. Imperial Aramaic (700-200 BCE)
3. Middle Aramaic (200 BCE-200 CE)
4. Late Aramaic (200-1200 CE)
5. Modern Aramaic (1200 CE-present)

### Major Dialect Groups

1. Western Aramaic
   - Judean Aramaic
   - Samaritan Aramaic
   - Christian Palestinian Aramaic

2. Eastern Aramaic
   - Syriac (Classical Syriac and Neo-Syriac languages)
   - Mandaic
   - Jewish Babylonian Aramaic

### Syriac

Syriac, an important Eastern Aramaic language, developed its own script and literature. It has three main dialectal divisions:

1. Western Syriac (Jacobite)
2. Eastern Syriac (Nestorian)
3. Central Syriac (Melkite)

Example of the Lord's Prayer in Syriac:

**ܐܰܒ݂ܽܘܢ ܕܒ݂ܰܫܡܰܝܳܐ ܢܶܬ݂ܩܰܕܰܫ ܫܡܳܟ݂**
(Aḇūn d-ḇa-šmayā neṯqadaš šmāḵ)
"Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name"

### Jewish Babylonian Aramaic

Jewish Babylonian Aramaic was the language of the Babylonian Talmud, one of the most important texts in Judaism. It has some distinctive features compared to other Aramaic dialects:

1. Pronunciation differences: 
   - **ā** often becomes **ō**
   - Final **-ā** often becomes **-ē**

2. Vocabulary influenced by Persian and Akkadian

Example from the Babylonian Talmud (Berakhot 2a):

**מֵאֵימָתַי קָרֵינַן קְרִיאַת שְׁמַע בְּאַרְמְשֵׁי**
(mē'ēmāṯay qārēnan qəri'aṯ šəma' bə'armšē)
"From when do we recite the Shema in the evenings?"

### Mandaic

Mandaic is the liturgical language of the Mandaean religion. It has its own script derived from the Aramaic alphabet. Some features of Mandaic include:

1. Preservation of the sound [ð] (voiced dental fricative)
2. Frequent use of the definite article **-a**

Example in Mandaic script:

ࡁࡔࡌࡀ ࡖࡄࡉࡉࡀ ࡓࡁࡉࡀ
(b-šuma d-hiia rabia)
"In the name of the Great Life"

## Grammar Features

### Verb System

Aramaic verbs have a complex system of stems (binyanim) that modify the basic meaning of the root. Here's a more detailed look at the stems using the root ק-ט-ל (q-ṭ-l) "to kill":

1. Pə'al (G-stem): Basic meaning
   **קְטַל** (qəṭal) - "he killed"

2. Pa''el (D-stem): Intensive or causative
   **קַטֵּל** (qaṭṭel) - "he massacred"

3. Ap̄'el (C-stem): Causative
   **אַקְטֵל** ('aqṭel) - "he caused to kill"

4. Iṯpə'el (Gt-stem): Reflexive or passive of Pə'al
   **אִתְקְטֵל** ('iṯqəṭel) - "he was killed"

5. Iṯpa''al (Dt-stem): Reflexive or passive of Pa''el
   **אִתְקַטַּל** ('iṯqaṭṭal) - "he was massacred"

6. Ittap̄'al (Ct-stem): Reflexive or passive of Ap̄'el
   **אִתַּקְטַל** ('ittaqṭal) - "he was caused to be killed"

### Tenses and Aspects

Aramaic has two main conjugations:

1. Perfect (or suffix conjugation): Generally used for completed actions
2. Imperfect (or prefix conjugation): Used for incomplete or habitual actions

Example of Pə'al stem conjugation for **כְּתַב** (kəṯaḇ) "to write":

Perfect:
| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 3rd masc. | **כְּתַב** (kəṯaḇ) | **כְּתַבוּ** (kəṯaḇū) |
| 3rd fem. | **כִּתְבַת** (kiṯḇaṯ) | **כְּתַבָה** (kəṯaḇā) |
| 2nd masc. | **כְּתַבְתְּ** (kəṯaḇt) | **כְּתַבְתּוּן** (kəṯaḇtūn) |
| 2nd fem. | **כְּתַבְתִּי** (kəṯaḇtī) | **כְּתַבְתֵּין** (kəṯaḇtēn) |

| 2nd fem. | **תִּכְתְּבִין** (tiḵtəḇīn) | **תִּכְתְּבָן** (tiḵtəḇān) |
| 1st | **אֶכְתּוֹב** ('eḵtōḇ) | **נִכְתּוֹב** (niḵtōḇ) |

### Nominal Patterns

Aramaic, like other Semitic languages, uses patterns of vowels and affixes to derive nouns from roots. Some common patterns include:

1. CəCāC - abstract nouns
   **קְרָב** (qəraḇ) - "battle" (from ק-ר-ב q-r-b "to approach")

2. CāCōC - agent nouns
   **כָּתוֹב** (kāṯōḇ) - "scribe" (from כ-ת-ב k-t-b "to write")

3. maCCāC - instrument or place nouns
   **מַכְתַּב** (maḵtaḇ) - "letter, document" (from כ-ת-ב k-t-b "to write")

4. CəCīC - adjectives
   **קַדִּישׁ** (qaddīš) - "holy" (from ק-ד-שׁ q-d-š "to be holy")

### Particles and Function Words

1. Definite article: In many dialects, the definite article is **-ā** (-א) attached to the end of nouns
   **מַלְכָּא** (malkā) - "the king"

2. Demonstratives:
   - **הָדֵין** (hāḏēn) - "this" (masc.)
   - **הָדָא** (hāḏā) - "this" (fem.)
   - **הָלֵּין** (hāllēn) - "these"

3. Prepositions:
   - **בְּ-** (bə-) - "in, with"
   - **לְ-** (lə-) - "to, for"
   - **מִן** (min) - "from"
   - **עַל** ('al) - "on, upon"

4. Conjunctions:
   - **וְ-** (wə-) - "and"
   - **אוֹ** ('ō) - "or"
   - **דְּ-** (də-) - "that, which"

5. Negation:
   - **לָא** (lā) - "not"
   - **לֵית** (lēṯ) - "there is not"

## Syntax

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by the particle **דִּי** (dī) or **-ד** (-ḏ):

**סִפְרָא דִּי כְּתַבְתְּ** (sip̄rā dī ḵəṯaḇt)
"The book that you wrote"

### Copula

Aramaic often omits the copula ("to be") in the present tense:

**מַלְכָּא טָב** (malkā ṭāḇ)
"The king (is) good"

For past and future, forms of the verb **הֲוָה** (hăwā) "to be" are used:

**מַלְכָּא הֲוָה טָב** (malkā hăwā ṭāḇ)
"The king was good"

### Existential Sentences

Aramaic uses **אִית** ('īṯ) for "there is" and **לֵית** (lēṯ) for "there is not":

**אִית לִי סֵפֶר** ('īṯ lī sēp̄er)
"I have a book" (lit. "There is to me a book")

**לֵית לִי סֵפֶר** (lēṯ lī sēp̄er)
"I don't have a book" (lit. "There is not to me a book")

### Word Order in Verbless Clauses

In verbless clauses, the predicate usually comes before the subject:

**טָב מַלְכָּא** (ṭāḇ malkā)
"Good (is) the king"

## Dialectal Variations

### Western vs. Eastern Aramaic

1. Sound changes:
   - Western Aramaic often preserves original [θ] and [ð], while Eastern Aramaic changes them to [t] and [d]
   - Eastern Aramaic often changes [ā] to [ō]

2. Vocabulary differences due to different contact languages (Greek for Western, Persian for Eastern)

### Syriac Particularities

1. Uses a different script (Estrangela, Serto, or East Syriac script)
2. Developed a system of vowel pointing different from the Tiberian system

### Modern Aramaic Languages

Modern Aramaic languages, also known as Neo-Aramaic, have undergone significant changes:

1. Loss of the emphatic state in many dialects
2. Development of an indefinite article (often from **חַד** ḥaḏ "one")
3. Changes in verbal system, including the development of compound tenses

Example from Neo-Aramaic (Northeastern Neo-Aramaic):

**אַנَא كِمزَبنِنّا خَا كتَبَا**
('ana kimzabninna xa ktawa)
"I sold a book"

This example shows the use of a preverbal particle (كِم- kim-) and an indefinite article (خَا xa) derived from "one".
