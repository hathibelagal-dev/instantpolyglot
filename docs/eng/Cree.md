# Cree (ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ / nēhiyawēwin)

Cree (ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ / nēhiyawēwin) is an Algonquian language spoken by approximately 117,000 people across Canada, from Alberta to Labrador. It is one of the most widely spoken Indigenous languages in North America. Cree consists of several dialects, which are sometimes considered separate languages due to their differences. The main dialect groups are Plains Cree, Woods Cree, Swampy Cree, Moose Cree, and Atikamekw.

## Writing Systems

Cree is written using two main systems: syllabics and the Roman alphabet (also called Standard Roman Orthography or SRO).

### Syllabics

The Cree syllabics writing system was developed in the 1840s by James Evans, a Methodist missionary. It is based on geometric shapes that represent consonant-vowel combinations. The orientation of the shape indicates the vowel, while the shape itself represents the consonant.

Basic syllabic chart:

| Consonant | a | e | i | o |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|
| p | ᐸ | ᐯ | ᐱ | ᐳ |
| t | ᑕ | ᑌ | ᑎ | ᑐ |
| k | ᑲ | ᑫ | ᑭ | ᑯ |
| c | ᒐ | ᒉ | ᒋ | ᒍ |
| m | ᒪ | ᒣ | ᒥ | ᒧ |
| n | ᓇ | ᓀ | ᓂ | ᓄ |
| s | ᓴ | ᓭ | ᓯ | ᓱ |
| y | ᔭ | ᔦ | ᔨ | ᔪ |

Final consonants are represented by smaller versions of the syllabic characters:

ᑊ (p), ᐟ (t), ᐠ (k), ᐨ (c), ᒼ (m), ᐣ (n), ᐢ (s), ᕀ (y)

### Standard Roman Orthography (SRO)

The Roman alphabet version of Cree uses the following letters:

a, c, e, h, i, k, m, n, o, p, s, t, w, y

Long vowels are indicated by a macron: ā, ē, ī, ō

## Morphology

Cree is a polysynthetic language, meaning words can be very complex and contain multiple morphemes that express various grammatical and semantic features.

### Nouns

Nouns in Cree are marked for number (singular and plural) and animacy (animate and inanimate).

#### Animacy

Animacy is an important feature in Cree grammar. Nouns are classified as either animate or inanimate. This classification affects verb agreement and plural formation.

Examples:
- Animate: **atim** (ᐊᑎᒼ) - dog, **sīsīp** (ᓰᓰᑊ) - duck, **asikan** (ᐊᓯᑲᐣ) - sock
- Inanimate: **mīciwin** (ᒦᒋᐏᐣ) - food, **wāskahikan** (ᐙᐢᑲᐦᐃᑲᐣ) - house, **astotin** (ᐊᐢᑐᑎᐣ) - hat

#### Number

Animate nouns typically form their plural by adding **-ak** (-ᐊᐠ):
- **atim** (ᐊᑎᒼ) - dog → **atimwak** (ᐊᑎᒧᐊᐠ) - dogs
- **sīsīp** (ᓰᓰᑊ) - duck → **sīsīpak** (ᓰᓰᐸᐠ) - ducks

Inanimate nouns typically form their plural by adding **-a** (-ᐊ):
- **mīciwin** (ᒦᒋᐏᐣ) - food → **mīciwina** (ᒦᒋᐏᓇ) - foods
- **wāskahikan** (ᐙᐢᑲᐦᐃᑲᐣ) - house → **wāskahikana** (ᐙᐢᑲᐦᐃᑲᓇ) - houses

### Verbs

Verbs in Cree are highly complex and can be classified into four main types based on transitivity and animacy:

1. VII (Verb Inanimate Intransitive): intransitive verbs with inanimate subjects
2. VAI (Verb Animate Intransitive): intransitive verbs with animate subjects
3. VTI (Verb Transitive Inanimate): transitive verbs with inanimate objects
4. VTA (Verb Transitive Animate): transitive verbs with animate objects

#### Person Marking

Verbs are marked for person and number of both subject and object (in transitive verbs). There are first, second, and third persons, each with singular and plural forms. Additionally, Cree has an inclusive and exclusive distinction in the first person plural.

Example of person marking for the VAI verb **nipā-** (ᓂᐹ-) (to sleep):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1      | **ninipān** (ᓂᓂᐹᐣ) - I sleep | **ninipānān** (ᓂᓂᐹᓈᐣ) - we sleep (excl.) <br> **kinipānānaw** (ᑭᓂᐹᓈᓇᐤ) - we sleep (incl.) |
| 2      | **kinipān** (ᑭᓂᐹᐣ) - you sleep | **kinipānāwāw** (ᑭᓂᐹᓈᐙᐤ) - you all sleep |
| 3      | **nipāw** (ᓂᐹᐤ) - he/she sleeps | **nipāwak** (ᓂᐹᐘᐠ) - they sleep |

#### Obviative

Cree has an obviative (third person obviate) form, used when there are two or more third-person referents in a sentence. The less prominent third person is marked as obviative.

Example:
**nāpēw wāpamēw atimwa** (ᓈᐯᐤ ᐙᐸᒣᐤ ᐊᑎᒧᐊ)
"The man sees the dog"
- **nāpēw** (ᓈᐯᐤ) - man, is the proximate (unmarked) third person
- **atimwa** (ᐊᑎᒧᐊ) - dog, is the obviative form, marked with the suffix **-wa** (-ᐘ)

#### Tense and Aspect

Cree verbs can express various tenses and aspects through prefixes and suffixes. Some common tense/aspect markers include:

- **kī-** (ᑮ-) (past tense prefix)
- **ka-** (ᑲ-) (future tense prefix)
- **-ski-** (-ᐢᑭ-) (habitual aspect)

Example:
- **ninipān** (ᓂᓂᐹᐣ) - I sleep
- **nikī-nipān** (ᓂᑮᓂᐹᐣ) - I slept
- **nika-nipān** (ᓂᑲᓂᐹᐣ) - I will sleep
- **ninipaski** (ᓂᓂᐸᐢᑭ) - I habitually sleep

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Cree:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1      | **niya** (ᓂᔭ) - I | **niyānān** (ᓂᔮᓈᐣ) - we (excl.) <br> **kiyānaw** (ᑭᔮᓇᐤ) - we (incl.) |
| 2      | **kiya** (ᑭᔭ) - you | **kiyawāw** (ᑭᔭᐙᐤ) - you all |
| 3      | **wiya** (ᐏᔭ) - he/she | **wiyawāw** (ᐏᔭᐙᐤ) - they |

Demonstrative pronouns:

- **awa** (ᐊᐘ) - this (animate)
- **ōma** (ᐆᒪ) - this (inanimate)
- **ana** (ᐊᓇ) - that (animate)
- **anima** (ᐊᓂᒪ) - that (inanimate)

### Possessives

Possession is indicated by prefixes and suffixes on the noun. The prefixes are similar to those used in verb conjugation:

- First person: **ni-** (ᓂ-)
- Second person: **ki-** (ᑭ-)
- Third person: **o-** (ᐅ-)

Examples:
- **nimistatim** (ᓂᒥᐢᑕᑎᒼ) - my horse
- **kimistatim** (ᑭᒥᐢᑕᑎᒼ) - your horse
- **omistatima** (ᐅᒥᐢᑕᑎᒪ) - his/her horse

For plural possessors, suffixes are added:
- **-nān** (-ᓈᐣ) - our (exclusive)
- **-naw** (-ᓇᐤ) - our (inclusive)
- **-wāw** (-ᐙᐤ) - your (plural)
- **-wāw** (-ᐙᐤ) - their

Examples:
- **nimistatim**inān (ᓂᒥᐢᑕᑎᒥᓈᐣ) - our horse (excl.)
- **kimistatim**inaw (ᑭᒥᐢᑕᑎᒥᓇᐤ) - our horse (incl.)
- **kimistatim**iwāw (ᑭᒥᐢᑕᑎᒥᐙᐤ) - your horse (pl.)
- **omistatim**iwāw (ᐅᒥᐢᑕᑎᒥᐙᐤ) - their horse

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Cree is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), but it can be flexible due to the language's rich morphology.

Example:
**iskwēw masinahikan ayamihcikēw** (ᐃᐢᑵᐤ ᒪᓯᓇᐦᐃᑲᐣ ᐊᔭᒥᐦᒋᑫᐤ)
woman   book        reads
"The woman reads a book"

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed using the particle **namōya** (ᓇᒨᔭ) before the verb:

**namōya ninipān** (ᓇᒨᔭ ᓂᓂᐹᐣ) - I don't sleep

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the question particle **cī** (ᒌ) at the end of a statement:

**kinipān cī?** (ᑭᓂᐹᐣ ᒌ) - Do you sleep?

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns:

- **awīna** (ᐊᐑᓇ) - who
- **kīkway** (ᑮᑿᕀ) - what
- **tānite** (ᑖᓂᑌ) - where
- **tānispī** (ᑖᓂᐢᐲ) - when
- **tānehki** (ᑖᓀᐦᑭ) - why

Example:
**awīna kā-wāpamat?** (ᐊᐑᓇ ᑳᐙᐸᒪᐟ) - Who did you see?

## Vocabulary

Cree vocabulary reflects the traditional lifestyle and environment of the Cree people. Many words are related to nature, hunting, and family relationships. Some basic vocabulary includes:

- **atim** (ᐊᑎᒼ) - dog
- **sīsīp** (ᓰᓰᑊ) - duck
- **maskwa** (ᒪᐢᑲᐧ) - bear
- **sīpiy** (ᓰᐱᕀ) - river
- **mīciwin** (ᒦᒋᐏᐣ) - food
- **nipiy** (ᓂᐱᕀ) - water

- **nōhtāwiy** (ᓄᐦᑖᐏᕀ) - my father
- **nisīmis** (ᓂᓰᒥᐢ) - my younger sibling

## Verb Conjugation

Let's look at the conjugation of the VAI verb **pimohtē-** (ᐱᒧᐦᑌ-) meaning "to walk" in the present tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **nipimohtān** (ᓂᐱᒧᐦᑖᐣ) | **nipimohtānān** (ᓂᐱᒧᐦᑖᓈᐣ) (excl.) <br> **kipimohtānaw** (ᑭᐱᒧᐦᑖᓇᐤ) (incl.) |
| 2 | **kipimohtān** (ᑭᐱᒧᐦᑖᐣ) | **kipimohtānāwāw** (ᑭᐱᒧᐦᑖᓈᐙᐤ) |
| 3 | **pimohtēw** (ᐱᒧᐦᑌᐤ) | **pimohtēwak** (ᐱᒧᐦᑌᐘᐠ) |

## Verb Stems and Derivation

Cree verbs are built on stems that can be modified to change meaning. Here are some examples:

1. Initial change: The first vowel of a verb can be changed to indicate certain grammatical functions, such as forming relative clauses.
   
   Example: 
   - **nipāw** (ᓂᐹᐤ) - he/she sleeps
   - **nēpāt** (ᓀᐹᐟ) - the one who sleeps

2. Reduplication: Repeating the first syllable can indicate continuous or repeated action.
   
   Example:
   - **mīcisow** (ᒦᒋᓱᐤ) - he/she eats
   - **māmīcisow** (ᒫᒦᒋᓱᐤ) - he/she is eating repeatedly or continuously

3. Preverbs: Particles added before the verb stem to modify its meaning.
   
   Example:
   - **nitawi-** (ᓂᑕᐏ-) - go to (do something)
   - **nitawi-mīcisow** (ᓂᑕᐏᒦᒋᓱᐤ) - he/she goes to eat

## Noun Incorporation

Cree allows for noun incorporation, where a noun is combined with a verb to create a new verb with a more specific meaning.

Example:
- **postayiwinisēw** (ᐳᐢᑕᔨᐏᓂᓭᐤ) - he/she puts on clothes
  (from **postaw-** 'put on' + **ayiwinisa** 'clothes' + **-ē** VAI final)

## Classificatory Verbs

Cree has a system of classificatory verbs that describe the handling or movement of objects based on their physical properties.

Examples:
- **tahkona** (ᑕᐦᑯᓇᐤ) - he/she holds or grasps (a rigid object)
- **sākina** (ᓵᑭᓇᐤ) - he/she holds or grasps (a string-like object)
- **nawati** (ᓇᐘᑎᐤ) - he/she catches (a flying object)

## Evidentiality

Cree has particles that can be used to indicate the source of information or the speaker's level of certainty:

- **māka** (ᒫᑲ) - indicates uncertainty or possibility
- **ēsa** (ᐁᓴ) - indicates reported speech or hearsay
- **takī** (ᑕᑮ) - indicates inference based on evidence

Example:
**kimiwan ēsa** (ᑭᒥᐘᐣ ᐁᓴ) - It's raining, I hear/They say it's raining

## Directionals

Cree has a system of directional particles that can be added to verbs to indicate motion:

- **itohtēw** (ᐃᑐᐦᑌᐤ) - he/she goes
- **pē-itohtēw** (ᐯᐃᑐᐦᑌᐤ) - he/she comes (motion towards the speaker)
- **away-itohtēw** (ᐊᐘᔨᑐᐦᑌᐤ) - he/she goes away (motion away from the speaker)

## Idiomatic Expressions

Cree has many idiomatic expressions that reflect its cultural context. Here are a few examples:

1. **tānisi** (ᑖᓂᓯ) - Hello/How are you? (literally "how")
2. **ay-hay** (ᐊᔨᐦᐊᕀ) - Thank you
3. **kiyām** (ᑭᔮᒼ) - It's okay/Never mind (used to express acceptance or resignation)
4. **tāpwē** (ᑖᑊᐍ) - It's true/Indeed (often used as a filler word)
5. **māmaskāc** (ᒫᒪᐢᑳᐨ) - It's amazing/wonderful

## Numbers

The Cree number system is based on a decimal system. Here are the numbers from one to ten:

1. **pēyak** (ᐯᔭᐠ)
2. **nīso** (ᓃᓱ)
3. **nisto** (ᓂᐢᑐ)
4. **nēwo** (ᓀᐓ)
5. **nīyānan** (ᓃᔮᓇᐣ)
6. **nikotwāsik** (ᓂᑯᑊᐙᓯᐠ)
7. **tēpakohp** (ᑌᐸᑯᐦᑊ)
8. **ayēnānēw** (ᐊᔦᓈᓀᐤ)
9. **kēkā-mitātaht** (ᑫᑳᒥᑖᑕᐦᐟ)
10. **mitātaht** (ᒥᑖᑕᐦᐟ)

Numbers after ten are formed by combining these basic numbers. For example:

20 - **nīsitanaw** (ᓃᓯᑕᓇᐤ)
100 - **mitātahtomitanaw** (ᒥᑖᑕᐦᑐᒥᑕᓇᐤ)

## Conclusion

This overview provides a glimpse into the complexity and richness of the Cree language. Its polysynthetic nature, intricate verb system, and cultural embeddedness make it a fascinating language to study and preserve. The use of both syllabics and Roman orthography reflects the language's adaptability and the efforts to maintain its vitality in the modern world.
