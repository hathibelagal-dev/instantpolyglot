# Arlandic

Arlandic is a fictional Indo-European language spoken by approximately 8 million people in the imaginary country of Arland. It forms its own distinct branch of the Indo-European language family, sharing some features with other branches but also possessing unique characteristics. Arlandic has two main dialects: Coastal and Inland, with the Coastal dialect being considered the standard form used in official contexts and media.

## Phonology and Orthography

### Vowels

Arlandic has a rich vowel system with both short and long vowels:

| Letter | Short Sound | Long Sound |
|--------|-------------|------------|
**a** | [a] | **ā** [aː]
**e** | [ε] | **ē** [eː]
**i** | [i] | **ī** [iː]
**o** | [o] | **ō** [oː]
**u** | [u] | **ū** [uː]
**ë** | [ə] | N/A

### Consonants

The consonant system of Arlandic includes several sounds not commonly found in other Indo-European languages:

| Letter | Sound | Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
**b** | [b] | **p** | [p]
**d** | [d] | **t** | [t]
**g** | [g] | **k** | [k]
**f** | [f] | **v** | [v]
**s** | [s] | **z** | [z]
**h** | [h] | **l** | [l]
**m** | [m] | **n** | [n]
**r** | [r] | **y** | [j]
**þ** | [θ] | **ð** | [ð]
**ç** | [ç] | **x** | [x]
**ñ** | [ŋ] | **w** | [w]

### Consonant clusters

Arlandic allows for complex consonant clusters, both word-initially and word-medially. Some notable clusters include:

| Cluster | Sound | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
**kh** | [kx] | **khāreþ** [kxaːrεθ] (to write)
**ph** | [pf] | **pholum** [pfolum] (leaf)
**tl** | [tɬ] | **tlēka** [tɬeːka] (to climb)
**zd** | **[zd]** | **zdōra** [zdoːra] (door)
**çn** | [çn] | **çnāva** [çnaːva] (snow)
**xr** | [xr] | **xrāma** [xraːma] (color)
**str** | [str] | **strōda** [stroːda] (street)
**spl** | [spl] | **splendōr** [splεndoːr] (shine)

### Phonotactics

Arlandic syllable structure can be represented as (C)(C)(C)V(C)(C), where C is a consonant and V is a vowel. This allows for words with complex consonant clusters, such as:

**strëngþ** [strəŋθ] (strength)
**phlëkst** [pfləkst] (to braid)

### Stress and vowel harmony

Arlandic has a unique stress system combined with vowel harmony. Words are divided into two harmony classes: light (a, e, i) and heavy (o, u). The vowel **ë** is neutral and can occur with either class. Stress typically falls on the first syllable of a word, but shifts to the first heavy vowel if present.

Examples:
**káreþ** [ˈkarεθ] (to speak)
**dolúm** [doˈlum] (sky)
**pëtíka** [pəˈtika] (animal)
**ëntëlégēn** [əntəˈlegeːn] (to understand)

In compound words, primary stress is on the first element, and secondary stress on the second:
**ˈkāre.ˌþōr** [ˈkaːrε.ˌθoːr] (storyteller)
**ˈign.ˌvënt** [ˈign.ˌvənt] (volcano)

The vowel harmony system affects certain affixes, which change their vowels to match the harmony class of the root. For example, the plural suffix **-i** becomes **-u** after heavy vowels:

**lōm** → **lōmu** (people)
**këvar** → **këvari** (birds)

### Dialectal variations

The Coastal and Inland dialects of Arlandic have some notable phonological differences:

1. The Inland dialect merges [θ] and [ð] into [f] and [v] respectively.
2. The Coastal dialect maintains the distinction between [ç] and [x], while the Inland dialect merges them into [x].
3. The Inland dialect has a tendency to reduce unstressed vowels to [ə], while the Coastal dialect maintains the original vowel qualities.

## Morphology

### Nouns

Arlandic nouns have two genders (animate and inanimate) and are inflected for number (singular and plural) and case (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and instrumental).

#### Gender

Animate nouns typically refer to living beings, while inanimate nouns refer to objects and abstract concepts. There are some exceptions based on cultural significance or historical reasons:

Animate: **lōm** (person), **këvar** (bird), **sōl** (sun), **lūna** (moon)
Inanimate: **dolum** (sky), **kërit** (stone), **akva** (water), **tëra** (earth)

#### Number

Plural formation depends on the noun's final sound and harmony class:

1. Add **-i** (light) or **-u** (heavy) to consonant-ending nouns:
   **lōm** → **lōmu** (people)
   **këvar** → **këvari** (birds)

2. Change final **-a** to **-ë**:
   **pëtika** → **pëtikë** (animals)

3. Add **-ëm** to vowel-ending nouns (except -a):
   **dolum** → **dolumëm** (skies)

#### Cases

Example declension for **lōm** (person), **këvar** (bird), **kërit** (stone), and **akva** (water):

| Case | Animate (cons.) | Animate (vowel) | Inanimate (cons.) | Inanimate (vowel) |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
Nom. sg. | lōm | këvar | kërit | akva
Nom. pl. | lōmu | këvari | këriti | akvë
Acc. sg. | lōmën | këvarën | kërit | akvam
Acc. pl. | lōmu | këvari | këriti | akvë
Gen. sg. | lōmës | këvarës | këritës | akvās
Gen. pl. | lōmëm | këvarëm | këritëm | akvëm
Dat. sg. | lōmū | këvarū | këritū | akvū
Dat. pl. | lōmum | këvarum | këritum | akvum
Inst. sg. | lōmel | këvarel | këritel | akval

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Arlandic agree with nouns in gender and number, but not in case. They have a single form for all cases.

Basic pattern for the adjective **mëran** (big):

| | Animate | Inanimate |
|--|---------|-----------|
Singular | mëran | mëran
Plural | mëranë | mëranë

Examples:
**mëran lōm** (a big person)
**mëranë lōmu** (big people)
**mëran kërit** (a big stone)
**mëranë këriti** (big stones)

Comparative and superlative forms:

Comparative: add **-ōr** to the stem
**mëran** → **mëranōr** (bigger)

Superlative: add **ar-** prefix to the comparative
**mëranōr** → **armëranōr** (biggest)

Adjectives can also be used predicatively with the copula **ës** (to be):
**Lōm ës mëran.** (The person is big.)

Arlandic also has a system of adjective intensifiers:

**per-** (very): **permëran** (very big)
**ult-** (extremely): **ultmëran** (extremely big)
**sëmi-** (somewhat): **sëmimëran** (somewhat big)

### Adverbs

Adverbs are typically formed by adding the suffix **-ō** to the adjective stem:

**mëran** (big) → **mëranō** (greatly)
**rëpid** (fast) → **rëpidō** (quickly)

Some common adverbs have irregular forms:
**bën** (well), **mal** (badly), **sēp** (often), **rār** (rarely)

### Verbs

Arlandic verbs are conjugated for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood. They display a unique aspect system with three distinctions: punctual, continuous, and iterative.

#### Verb classes

Arlandic verbs are divided into four classes based on their infinitive endings:

1. **-eþ**: **kāreþ** (to speak)
2. **-aþ**: **ampaþ** (to love)
3. **-īþ**: **dormīþ** (to sleep)
4. **-ōþ**: **kantōþ** (to sing)

#### Present tense

Example conjugation for **kāreþ** (to speak):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
1st | **kāram** | **kāromës**
2nd | **kāras** | **kāroyūs**
3rd | **kārat** | **kāront**

#### Aspect system

Arlandic uses prefixes to indicate aspect:

Punctual (default): no prefix
**Ek kāram** (I speak - single instance)

Continuous: **en-** prefix
**Ek enkāram** (I am speaking - ongoing action)

Iterative: **re-** prefix
**Ek rekāram** (I speak repeatedly - habitual action)

#### Past tense

The past tense is formed by adding **-ët** to the verb stem, followed by person/number endings:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
1st | **kārëtam** | **kārëtomës**
2nd | **kārëtas** | **kārëtoyūs**
3rd | **kārët** | **kārëtont**

#### Future tense

The future tense uses the suffix **-ëv** before person/number endings:

**Ek kārëvam** (I will speak)
**Tū kārëvas** (You will speak)
**Sē kārëvat** (He/She will speak)

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed by using the bare verb stem for singular and adding **-ët** for plural:

**kār!** (Speak! - singular)
**kārët!** (Speak! - plural)

#### Subjunctive

The subjunctive mood uses the suffix **-oy**:

**Ek kāroy** (I would speak)
**Tū kāroys** (You would speak)
**Sē kāroy** (He/She would speak)

#### Participles

Present participle: stem + **-ant**
**kārant** (speaking)

Past participle: stem + **-ët**
**kārët** (spoken)

#### Verbal noun

Formed by adding **-ëm** to the verb stem:
**kārëm** (the act of speaking)

#### Irregular verbs

Arlandic has several irregular verbs, the most common being **ës** (to be) and **hav** (to have):

Conjugation of **ës** (to be):

| Person | Present | Past | Future |

3pl | **havont** | **havëtont** | **havëvont**

## Syntax

Arlandic has a relatively flexible word order, with SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) being the most common. However, other orders are possible for emphasis or stylistic reasons.

### Basic sentence structure

1. Basic SOV order:
   **Ek lōmën kāram.** (I person-ACC speak. / I speak to a person.)

2. Emphasis on object:
   **Lōmën ek kāram.** (It's to a person that I speak.)

3. Verb-initial for questions:
   **Kāras tū lōmën?** (Speak you to-person? / Do you speak to a person?)

4. Topicalization:
   **Dolumū, ek oft vëdam.** (To the sky, I often look.)

### Question formation

Questions are formed in two ways:

1. Verb-subject inversion:
   **Kārat sē lōmën?** (Speaks he to-person? / Does he speak to a person?)

2. Using interrogative pronouns:
   **Kvë kārat sē?** (Who speaks he? / To whom does he speak?)
   **Kvët vëdas tū?** (What see you? / What do you see?)

### Negation

Negation is formed by using the particle **në** before the verb:
**Ek në kāram.** (I don’t speak.)

Double negation is allowed and intensifies the negation:
**Ek në kāram nēkët.** (I don’t speak nothing. / I don’t speak anything at all.)

### Definiteness and articles

There are no definite or indefinite articles in Arlandic. Definiteness is expressed through word order, context, or by using demonstratives:

**Lōm ëñat.** (A person came.)
**Kis lōm ëñat.** (This person came.)

In some cases, the numeral **oin** (one) can be used as an indefinite article:
**Oin lōm ëñat.** (One person came. / A person came.)

### Adjective and adverb placement

Adjectives typically precede the nouns they modify:
**mëran dolum** (big sky)
**pëlak këvar** (beautiful bird)

Adverbs usually precede the verbs they modify, but can be placed elsewhere for emphasis:
**Sē rëpidō kārat.** (He quickly speaks.)
**Rëpidō, sē kārat.** (Quickly, he speaks.)

### Coordination and subordination

Coordination is achieved using conjunctions:

**ëd** (and): **Ek kāram ëd tū auskulas.** (I speak and you listen.)
**av** (or): **Tū kāras av ek kāram.** (You speak or I speak.)
**mën** (but): **Ek kāram, mën tū në auskulas.** (I speak, but you don’t listen.)

Subordinate clauses are introduced by subordinating conjunctions:

**kë** (that): **Ek xëlim kë tū kāras.** (I think that you speak.)
**sī** (if): **Sī tū kāras, ek auskulëvam.** (If you speak, I will listen.)
**kvën** (when): **Kvën tū kāras, ek auskulam.** (When you speak, I listen.)

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses are formed using the relative pronoun **kë**:

**Lōm, kë ek vëdam, kārat.** (The person, whom I see, speaks.)
**Kërit, kë ën tërā yakat, mëran ës.** (The stone, which on earth lies, is big.)

### Case usage

Arlandic's case system is used to indicate grammatical relationships between words:

Nominative: used for the subject of a sentence
**Lōm kārat.** (The person speaks.)

Accusative: used for the direct object
**Ek lōmën vëdam.** (I see the person.)

Genitive: used for possession and after certain prepositions
**Lōmës kërit** (The person's stone)
**Ond lōmës** (Without the person)

Dative: used for the indirect object and after certain prepositions
**Ek kërit lōmū dëvam.** (I give the stone to the person.)
**Ad lōmū** (Towards the person)

Instrumental: used to indicate means or accompaniment
**Ek këritel kāram.** (I speak with the stone.)

### Verb valency and argument structure

Arlandic verbs can be classified based on their valency:

Avalent (zero-valency): **Pluvat.** (It rains.)
Monovalent (intransitive): **Lōm dormīt.** (The person sleeps.)
Divalent (transitive): **Lōm këritën vëdat.** (The person sees the stone.)
Trivalent (ditransitive): **Lōm këritën pëtikū dëvat.** (The person gives the stone to the animal.)

Some verbs can change their valency through the use of prefixes or suffixes:

**kāreþ** (to speak) → **ënkāreþ** (to discuss): 
**Lōmu ënkāront politikām.** (The people discuss politics.)

### Impersonal constructions

Arlandic uses impersonal constructions for various expressions:

Weather phenomena: **Pluvat.** (It rains.), **Nivat.** (It snows.)
Necessity: **Nësës kāreþ.** (It is necessary to speak.)
Possibility: **Posës vëdeþ dolumën.** (It is possible to see the sky.)

### Reflexive and reciprocal constructions

Reflexive constructions use the reflexive pronoun **sē**:
**Lōm sē vëdat ën spëkulō.** (The person sees themselves in the mirror.)

Reciprocal constructions use the pronoun **ënanðër**:
**Lōmu ënanðër ampont.** (The people love each other.)
