# Old English

Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon, was the language spoken in England from roughly 450 to 1100 CE. It is the earliest historical form of the English language and belongs to the West Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. Old English was significantly different from Modern English in its grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.

## Historical Context

Old English developed from the languages of Germanic tribes (Angles, Saxons, and Jutes) who settled in Britain from the 5th century CE. The period of Old English is generally considered to begin with these settlements and end with the Norman Conquest of 1066, though the language continued to be spoken and written for some time after that.

The language went through several stages of development:
1. Early Old English (450-650 CE)
2. Middle Old English (650-900 CE)
3. Late Old English (900-1066 CE)

Each of these periods saw changes in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, influenced by historical events such as the spread of Christianity (introducing Latin loanwords) and Viking invasions (introducing Norse loanwords).

## Spelling and pronunciation

Old English was written using the Latin alphabet, with a few additional characters. The pronunciation was quite different from Modern English, with some sounds that no longer exist in the language.

### Vowels

Old English had both short and long vowels. Long vowels were sometimes marked with a macron (ā) in modern editions, but not in original manuscripts.

| Letter | Short sound | Long sound | Example |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------|
| a | [ɑ] as in “father” | [ɑː] longer version of short a | **mann** [mɑnn] (“man”), **bān** [bɑːn] (“bone”) |
| æ | [æ] as in “cat” | [æː] longer version of short æ | **dæg** [dæj] (“day”), **sǣ** [sæː] (“sea”) |
| e | [e] as in “bet” | [eː] similar to “ay” in “say” | **helpan** [helpɑn] (“to help”), **hēr** [heːr] (“here”) |
| i | [i] as in “pin” | [iː] as in “seen” | **singan** [singɑn] (“to sing”), **wīn** [wiːn] (“wine”) |
| o | [o] as in “bog” | [oː] as in “boat” | **god** [god] (“god”), **gōd** [goːd] (“good”) |
| u | [u] as in “put” | [uː] as in “boot” | **full** [full] (“full”), **hūs** [huːs] (“house”) |
| y | [y] like German ü | [yː] longer version of short y | **cynn** [kynn] (“kin”), **brȳd** [bryːd] (“bride”) |

### Consonants

Most consonants were pronounced similarly to their Modern English counterparts, with a few exceptions:

| Letter | Sound | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| c | [k] before back vowels, [tʃ] (as in “church”) before front vowels | **cēosan** [tʃeːozɑn] (“to choose”), **cald** [kɑld] (“cold”) |
| g | [g] before back vowels, [j] (as in “yes”) before front vowels | **gōd** [goːd] (“good”), **ġēar** [jæːɑr] (“year”) |
| h | [h] at the beginning of words, [x] (as in Scottish “loch”) elsewhere | **hūs** [huːs] (“house”), **niht** [nixt] (“night”) |
| þ (thorn) | [θ] (as in “thin”) or [ð] (as in “this”) | **þing** [θing] (“thing”), **brōþor** [broːðor] (“brother”) |
| ð (eth) | [θ] or [ð], used interchangeably with þ | **ōðer** [oːðer] (“other”) |
| sc | [ʃ] (as in “ship”) | **scip** [ʃip] (“ship”) |
| cg | [dʒ] (as in “edge”) | **ecg** [edʒ] (“edge”) |
| f | [f] at the beginning and end of words, [v] between vowels | **fæder** [fæder] (“father”), **ofer** [over] (“over”) |

### Diphthongs

Old English had several diphthongs:

| Diphthong | Pronunciation | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| ea | [æɑ] | **eald** [æɑld] (“old”) |
| eo | [eo] | **feoh** [feox] (“cattle, money”) |
| ie | [ie] | **hiere** [hiere] (“her”) |

### Stress

In Old English, stress was typically on the first syllable of a word, except in compounds where it fell on the first syllable of the second element.

Examples:
- **hēafod** [ˈheːɑvod] (“head”)
- **ġesēþan** [jeˈseːθɑn] (“to testify”)
- **inġehyġd** [injeˈhyjd] (“thought, understanding”)

In compounds:
- **hēafodmann** [heːɑvodˈmɑnn] (“head man, captain”)
- **woruldcyning** [woruldˈkyning] (“world-king, earthly king”)

## Morphology

Old English was a highly inflected language, with a complex system of declensions and conjugations.

### Nouns

Nouns in Old English had three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), four cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative), and two numbers (singular and plural). There were several declension patterns, known as “strong” and “weak” declensions.

Example of a strong masculine noun declension (**stān** - “stone”):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **stān** | **stānas** |
| Accusative | **stān** | **stānas** |
| Genitive | **stānes** | **stāna** |
| Dative | **stāne** | **stānum** |

Example of a weak feminine noun declension (**sunne** - “sun”):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **sunne** | **sunnan** |
| Accusative | **sunnan** | **sunnan** |
| Genitive | **sunnan** | **sunnena** |
| Dative | **sunnan** | **sunnum** |

Example of a strong neuter noun declension (**scip** - “ship”):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **scip** | **scipu** |
| Accusative | **scip** | **scipu** |
| Genitive | **scipes** | **scipa** |
| Dative | **scipe** | **scipum** |

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Old English agreed with the nouns they modified in gender, number, and case. They also had two declension patterns: strong and weak. The strong declension was used when the adjective was not preceded by a determiner, while the weak declension was used when it was.

Example of strong adjective declension (**gōd** - “good”):

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nom. Sing. | **gōd** | **gōd** | **gōd** |
| Acc. Sing. | **gōdne** | **gōde** | **gōd** |
| Gen. Sing. | **gōdes** | **gōdre** | **gōdes** |
| Dat. Sing. | **gōdum** | **gōdre** | **gōdum** |
| Nom. Pl. | **gōde** | **gōda** | **gōd** |
| Acc. Pl. | **gōde** | **gōda** | **gōd** |
| Gen. Pl. | **gōdra** | **gōdra** | **gōdra** |
| Dat. Pl. | **gōdum** | **gōdum** | **gōdum** |

Example of weak adjective declension (**gōda** - “the good”):

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nom. Sing. | **gōda** | **gōde** | **gōde** |
| Acc. Sing. | **gōdan** | **gōdan** | **gōde** |
| Gen. Sing. | **gōdan** | **gōdan** | **gōdan** |
| Dat. Sing. | **gōdan** | **gōdan** | **gōdan** |
| Nom. Pl. | **gōdan** | **gōdan** | **gōdan** |
| Acc. Pl. | **gōdan** | **gōdan** | **gōdan** |
| Gen. Pl. | **gōdena** | **gōdena** | **gōdena** |
| Dat. Pl. | **gōdum** | **gōdum** | **gōdum** |

Adjectives also had comparative and superlative forms:

- Positive: **heard** (“hard”)
- Comparative: **heardra** (“harder”)
- Superlative: **heardost** (“hardest”)

Some adjectives had irregular comparatives and superlatives:

- **gōd** (“good”), **betera** (“better”), **betst** (“best”)
- **yfel** (“evil”), **wyrsa** (“worse”), **wyrst** (“worst”)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Old English had different forms for first, second, and third person, as well as for different cases.

| Person | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive | Dative |
|--------|------------|------------|----------|--------|
| 1st Sing. | **ic** | **mē** | **mīn** | **mē** |
| 2nd Sing. | **þū** | **þē** | **þīn** | **þē** |
| 3rd Sing. Masc. | **hē** | **hine** | **his** | **him** |
| 3rd Sing. Fem. | **hēo** | **hīe** | **hire** | **hire** |
| 3rd Sing. Neut. | **hit** | **hit** | **his** | **him** |
| 1st Pl. | **wē** | **ūs** | **ūre** | **ūs** |
| 2nd Pl. | **gē** | **ēow** | **ēower** | **ēow** |
| 3rd Pl. | **hīe** | **hīe** | **hira** | **him** |

Demonstrative pronouns also existed, such as **þes** (“this”) and **sē** (“that”), which declined for gender, number, and case.

Example of the declension of **sē** (“that”):

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nom. Sing. | **sē** | **sēo** | **þæt** |
| Acc. Sing. | **þone** | **þā** | **þæt** |
| Gen. Sing. | **þæs** | **þǣre** | **þæs** |
| Dat. Sing. | **þǣm** | **þǣre** | **þǣm** |
| Nom. Pl. | **þā** | **þā** | **þā** |
| Acc. Pl. | **þā** | **þā** | **þā** |
| Gen. Pl. | **þāra** | **þāra** | **þāra** |
| Dat. Pl. | **þǣm** | **þǣm** | **þǣm** |

Relative pronouns in Old English were often identical to demonstrative pronouns, but the indeclinable particle **þe** was also used:

**Se mann þe ic geseah** (“The man whom I saw”)

### Verbs

Old English verbs were conjugated for person, number, tense, and mood. There were two main types of verbs: strong verbs and weak verbs.

Strong verbs formed their past tense and past participle by changing the root vowel (ablaut). There were seven classes of strong verbs, each with its own ablaut pattern.

Example of a strong verb (**singan** - “to sing”):

| Form | Present | Past Singular | Past Plural | Past Participle |
|------|---------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Infinitive | **singan** | - | - | - |
| 1st Sing. | **singe** | **sang** | **sungon** | **gesungen** |
| 2nd Sing. | **singest** | **sunge** | **sungon** | **gesungen** |
| 3rd Sing. | **singeþ** | **sang** | **sungon** | **gesungen** |
| Plural | **singaþ** | **sungon** | **sungon** | **gesungen** |

The seven classes of strong verbs had different vowel gradations:

1. ī - ā - i - i (e.g., **drīfan** - **drāf** - **drifon** - **gedrifen** “to drive”)
2. ēo - ēa - u - o (e.g., **cēosan** - **cēas** - **curon** - **gecoren** “to choose”)
3. e - æ - u - o (e.g., **helpan** - **healp** - **hulpon** - **geholpen** “to help”)
4. e - æ - ǣ - o (e.g., **beran** - **bær** - **bǣron** - **geboren** “to bear”)
5. e - æ - ǣ - e (e.g., **metan** - **mæt** - **mǣton** - **gemeten** “to measure”)
6. a - ō - ō - a (e.g., **faran** - **fōr** - **fōron** - **gefaren** “to go”)
7. Various patterns, often with reduplication in the past tense (e.g., **hātan** - **hēt** - **hēton** - **gehāten** “to call”)

Weak verbs formed their past tense and past participle by adding a dental suffix (-d- or -t-).

Example of a weak verb (**hieran** - “to hear”):

| Form | Present | Past | Past Participle |
|------|---------|------|-----------------|
| Infinitive | **hieran** | - | - |
| 1st Sing. | **hiere** | **hierde** | **gehiered** |
| 2nd Sing. | **hierest** | **hierdest** | **gehiered** |
| 3rd Sing. | **hiereþ** | **hierde** | **gehiered** |
| Plural | **hieraþ** | **hierdon** | **gehiered** |

There were three classes of weak verbs:

1. Verbs with -e- in the infinitive (like **hieran** above)
2. Verbs with no vowel before the infinitive ending (e.g., **lufian** - **lufode** - **gelufod** “to love”)
3. A small class of verbs with various changes (e.g., **habban** - **hæfde** - **gehæfd** “to have”)

Old English also had a small group of preterite-present verbs, which had present tense forms that looked like the past tense of strong verbs. These include ancestors of modern modal verbs.

Example of a preterite-present verb (**cunnan** - “to know how”):

| Form | Present | Past |
|------|---------|------|
| 1st Sing. | **cann** | **cūþe** |
| 2nd Sing. | **canst** | **cūþest** |
| 3rd Sing. | **cann** | **cūþe** |
| Plural | **cunnon** | **cūþon** |

Other preterite-present verbs included:
- **magan** (“may, to be able to”)
- **sculan** (“shall, ought to”)
- **durran** (“to dare”)
- **þurfan** (“to need”)
- **witan** (“to know”)

Old English verbs also had subjunctive forms, used to express wishes, hypotheticals, and indirect speech:

**Gif hē cume, ic hine gesēo.** (“If he comes/should come, I will see him.”)

The verb “to be” was highly irregular in Old English:

| Person | Present Indicative | Present Subjunctive | Past Indicative | Past Subjunctive |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1st Sing. | **eom** | **sīe** | **wæs** | **wǣre** |
| 2nd Sing. | **eart** | **sīe** | **wǣre** | **wǣre** |
| 3rd Sing. | **is** | **sīe** | **wæs** | **wǣre** |
| Plural | **sindon** | **sīen** | **wǣron** | **wǣren** |

Verbs in Old English could also form a passive voice using the verb **bēon** (“to be”) with a past participle:

**Sēo bōc wæs ġewriten.** (“The book was written.”)

### Numerals

Old English had a complex system of numerals:

| Number | Cardinal | Ordinal |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 1 | **ān** | **forma** |
| 2 | **twēġen** (masc.), **twā** (fem./neut.) | **ōþer** |
| 3 | **þrīe** (masc.), **þrēo** (fem./neut.) | **þridda** |
| 4 | **fēower** | **fēorþa** |
| 5 | **fīf** | **fīfta** |
| 10 | **tīen** | **tēoþa** |
| 20 | **twēntiġ** | **twēntiġoþa** |
| 100 | **hund** | **hundtēontiġoþa** |
| 1000 | **þūsend** | **þūsendoþa** |

Numbers declined for case and sometimes for gender:

**mid twǣm handum** (“with two hands”, dative)

## Syntax

Old English had a more flexible word order than Modern English, largely due to its extensive case system. However, the most common word order was Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), especially in subordinate clauses.

Example:
**Hē þone cyning sōhte.** 
(“He the king sought.” = “He sought the king.”)

In main clauses, the verb often moved to the second position (V2 word order):
**Þone cyning sōhte hē.**
(“The king sought he.” = “He sought the king.”)

### Negation

Negation in Old English was typically formed by using the particle **ne** before the verb, often combined with **na** or **nāht** after the verb for emphasis.

Example:
**Ic ne secge.**
(“I not say.” = “I do not say.”)

**Hē ne cōm nā.**
(“He not came not.” = “He did not come.”)

Multiple negation was common and did not cancel out:
**Nǣfre ne geseah nān mann God.** 
(“Never not saw no man God.” = “No man has ever seen God.”)

### Questions

Questions were formed by inverting the subject and verb:

**Singest þū?**
(“Sing you?” = “Do you sing?”)

Wh-questions used interrogative pronouns or adverbs:
**Hwæt dēst þū?**
(“What do you?” = “What are you doing?”)

### Impersonal Constructions

Old English made extensive use of impersonal constructions, especially with verbs expressing emotions or physical sensations:

**Mē þynceþ** 
(“To me it seems” = “It seems to me”)

**Hine hungrode** 
(“Him hungered” = “He was hungry”)

### Conjunctions and Subordinate Clauses

Old English had a variety of conjunctions to introduce subordinate clauses:

- **þæt** (“that”): **Ic wāt þæt hē cymþ.** (“I know that he comes.”)
- **gif** (“if”): **Gif hit rēneþ, ic in blīfe.** (“If it rains, I stay in.”)
- **þēah** (“although”): **Þēah hit cald sī, ic ūt gā.** (“Although it be cold, I go out.”)
- **þā** (“when”): **Þā hē cōm, ic slēp.** (“When he came, I slept.”)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses were often introduced by the indeclinable particle **þe**, sometimes in combination with a demonstrative pronoun:

**Se mann þe ic geseah** (“The man whom I saw”)
**Sēo bōc sēo þe ic rǣdde** (“The book which I read”)

## Vocabulary

Old English vocabulary was primarily Germanic in origin, with relatively few loanwords compared to Modern English. However, it did borrow some words from Latin (often through Christianity) and Old Norse (due to Viking influence).

Examples of native Old English words:
- **mann** (“man, person”)
- **wīf** (“woman, wife”)
- **cild** (“child”)
- **hūs** (“house”)
- **dōn** (“to do”)
- **etan** (“to eat”)
- **drincan** (“to drink”)
- **fēran** (“to go, travel”)
- **secgan** (“to say”)
- **þencean** (“to think”)
- **sweord** (“sword”)
- **scield** (“shield”)
- **cyning** (“king”)
- **hlāford** (“lord”, literally “loaf-ward”)
- **hlǣfdige** (“lady”, literally “loaf-kneader”)

Examples of Latin loanwords:
- **engel** (“angel”) from Latin “angelus”
- **biscop** (“bishop”) from Latin “episcopus”
- **scōl** (“school”) from Latin “schola”
- **win** (“wine”) from Latin “vinum”
- **strǣt** (“street”) from Latin “strata via”
- **cēap** (“cheap”, originally meaning “trade”) from Latin “caupo”
- **mynet** (“coin”) from Latin “moneta”

Examples of Old Norse loanwords:
- **lagu** (“law”) from Old Norse “lǫg”
- **hit** (“to hit”) from Old Norse “hitta”
- **þēg** (“they”) from Old Norse “þeir”
- **sunt** (“are”) from Old Norse “sunt”
- **rādan** (“to read”) from Old Norse “rāða”
- **wrang** (“wrong”) from Old Norse “rangr”
- **hūsbonda** (“husband”) from Old Norse “hūsbōndi”

### Word Formation

Old English had a rich system of word formation, including compounding and affixation.

Compounding examples:
- **woruldcyning** (“world-king” = “earthly king”)
- **heofonfugol** (“heaven-fowl” = “bird of the sky”)
- **bōchūs** (“book-house” = “library”)
- **ealdhlaford** (“old-lord” = “former lord”)
- **frumsceppend** (“first-shaper” = “creator”)
- **manncynn** (“mankind” = “human race”)

Affixation examples:
- Prefix **un-** to create negatives: **unfæger** (“un-fair” = “ugly”)
- Suffix **-lēas** meaning “without”: **hlāflēas** (“loaf-less” = “poor”)
- Prefix **for-** intensifying the meaning: **forswelgan** (“to swallow up”)
- Suffix **-lic** forming adjectives: **cynelic** (“kingly”)
- Prefix **ge-** often used to form past participles: **gewriten** (“written”)
- Suffix **-ung/-ing** forming verbal nouns: **leornung** (“learning”)

## Dialects

Old English had four main dialects:

1. Northumbrian: spoken in northern England
2. Mercian: spoken in the Midlands
3. West Saxon: spoken in the south and west, became the dominant literary dialect
4. Kentish: spoken in the southeast

These dialects had differences in phonology, morphology, and vocabulary. For example:

- The West Saxon word **scieppan** (“to create”) corresponded to Anglian (Northumbrian and Mercian) **sceppan**.
- West Saxon **īe** corresponded to Anglian **ē**: West Saxon **hīeran** vs. Anglian **hēran** (“to hear”).
- Northumbrian often retained the older form **ā** where other dialects had **ō**: Northumbrian **stān** vs. West Saxon **stōn** (“stone”).

The majority of surviving Old English texts are in the West Saxon dialect, largely due to the efforts of King Alfred the Great in promoting literacy and learning in his kingdom of Wessex.

## Writing System

Old English was initially written using the runic alphabet known as futhorc, but with the spread of Christianity, it began to be written in the Latin alphabet with some additional characters:

- **Æ æ** (ash): representing the sound [æ]
- **Þ þ** (thorn): representing the sound [θ] or [ð]
- **Ð ð** (eth): also representing [θ] or [ð], used interchangeably with thorn
- **Ƿ ƿ** (wynn): representing [w], later replaced by **W w**

Example of Old English text using these characters:
**Fæder ūre þū þe eart on heofonum, sī þīn nama ġehālgod.**
(“Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.”)

## Sample Texts

Here are a few sample texts in Old English to illustrate the language:

1. Opening lines of Beowulf:

**Hwæt! Wē Gār-Dena in ġēar-dagum,
þēod-cyninga, þrym ġefrūnon,
hū ðā æþelingas ellen fremedon.**

(“Lo, we have heard of the glory of the Spear-Danes, of the kings of the people, in the days of yore, how the princes performed deeds of valor.”)

2. The Lord's Prayer (West Saxon dialect):

**Fæder ūre þū þe eart on heofonum,
Sī þīn nama ġehālgod.
Tōbecume þīn rīċe,
ġewurþe ðīn willa, on eorðan swā swā on heofonum.
Ūrne ġedæġhwāmlīcan hlāf syle ūs tō dæġ,
and forġyf ūs ūre gyltas, swā swā wē forġyfað ūrum gyltendum.
And ne ġelǣd þū ūs on costnunge, ac ālȳs ūs of yfele. Sōþlīċe.**

3. A riddle from the Exeter Book:

**Ic eom wunderlicu wiht, wīfum on hyhte,
neahbuendum nyt; nǣngum sceþþe
burgsittendra, nymþe bonan ānum.
Staþol mīn is steapheah, stonde ic on bedde,
neoþan rūh nāthwǣr. Neþeð hwīlum
ful cyrtenu ceorles dohtor,
mōdwlonc meowle, þæt hēo on mec grīpeð,
rǣseð mec on rēodne, rēafað mīn hēafod,
fēgeð mec on fæsten. Fēleþ sōna
mīnes gemōtes, sēo þe mec nearwað,
wīf wundenlocc. Wǣt bið þæt ēage.**

(The solution to this riddle is “an onion”.)

These texts showcase various features of Old English, including its complex grammar, distinctive vocabulary, and use of alliteration in poetry.

Old English literature includes epic poetry (such as Beowulf), religious texts, chronicles, riddles, and various prose works. The language underwent significant changes following the Norman Conquest in 1066, leading to the Middle English period, which saw a substantial influx of French vocabulary and gradual simplification of the grammar.
