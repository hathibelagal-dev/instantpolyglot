# Dinka

Dinka (Thuɔŋjäŋ or Muɔnyjäŋ) is a Nilotic language spoken primarily in South Sudan by the Dinka people. It belongs to the Western Nilotic branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family. With approximately 3-4 million speakers, Dinka is one of the most widely spoken languages in South Sudan, predominantly used in the Bahr el Ghazal region and along the White Nile.

## Dialects

Dinka comprises several major dialects, which can be broadly classified into five groups:

1. Northeastern (Padang)
2. Southeastern (Bor)
3. South Central (Agar)
4. Southwestern (Rek)
5. Northwestern (Ruweng)

While there is mutual intelligibility between these dialects, they exhibit differences in vocabulary, pronunciation, and some grammatical features. This overview will primarily focus on the Rek dialect, which is considered the most widely spoken and understood.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Dinka possesses a rich consonant inventory, including plosives, nasals, and approximants. One distinctive feature is the presence of implosive consonants.

| Manner | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Plosive | p b | t d | c ɟ | k ɡ | ʔ |
| Implosive | ɓ | ɗ | | | |
| Nasal | m | n | ɲ | ŋ | |
| Trill | | r | | | |
| Approximant | w | l | j | | h |

Examples:
- **piu** [piu] "water"
- **ɓöök** [ɓø̤ːk] "dog"
- **ɗït** [ɗḭt] "big"
- **cäm** [cæm] "eat"

### Vowels

Dinka features a complex vowel system with distinctions in length, voice quality, and tongue root position.

| | Front | Central | Back |
|---|-------|---------|------|
| Close | i iː ḭ ḭː | ɨ ɨː ɨ̰ ɨ̰ː | u uː ṵ ṵː |
| Mid | e eː e̤ e̤ː | | o oː o̤ o̤ː |
| Open | | a aː a̰ a̰ː | |

The vowels can be:
- Short or long (indicated by ː)
- Modal voice or breathy voice (indicated by ̤)
- Modal voice or creaky voice (indicated by ̰)

Examples:
- **tiim** [ti̤ːm] "tree"
- **lɛ̈ɛ̈i** [lɛ̤ːi] "animal"
- **dhɔ̰́ɔ̰k** [ðɔ̰́ɔ̰k] "boys"

### Tones

Dinka is a tonal language with four contrastive tones:

1. High (H): ́
2. Low (L): ̀
3. Falling (F): ̂
4. Rising (R): ̌

Examples:
- **mál** [mál] (H) "peace"
- **màl** [màl] (L) "to roast"
- **mâl** [mâl] (F) "to gather"
- **mǎl** [mǎl] (R) "to finish"

Tones play a crucial role in distinguishing lexical meanings and grammatical functions in Dinka.

## Morphophonology

Dinka exhibits complex morphophonological processes, particularly in its verbal system. These processes involve changes in vowel quality, vowel length, and tone.

### Vowel Gradation

Dinka verbs undergo vowel gradation to express different grammatical categories. This process involves changes in vowel quality and/or length:

1. First grade (basic form):
   **tèèm** "to cut"

2. Second grade (causative/benefactive):
   **tɛ̀ɛm** "to cut for someone"

3. Third grade (antipassive/passive):
   **tɛ̌ɛm** "to be cut"

This gradation can also affect noun derivation:
- **lɔ́ɔc** "to wash"
- **lóoc** "washing" (verbal noun)

### Consonant Mutation

Some Dinka dialects exhibit consonant mutation, where the initial consonant of a word changes in certain grammatical contexts:

- **piu** "water" → **biu** "in the water"
- **cop** "to open" → **jop** "opened"

This process is more prevalent in some dialects (e.g., Agar) than others (e.g., Rek).

### Vowel Harmony

Dinka exhibits vowel harmony, particularly in terms of advanced tongue root (ATR) features:

- [+ATR]: i, e, u, o
- [-ATR]: ɪ, ɛ, ʊ, ɔ, a

Suffixes often harmonize with the ATR quality of the root:

**tíŋ** "woman" + **-ɔ̀** (plural) → **tíŋɔ̀** "women"
**thìn** "liver" + **-ɔ̀** (plural) → **thìnɔ̀** "livers"

### Tone Sandhi

Dinka displays complex tonal interactions between words:

**lɛ̀ɛi** (L) "animal" + **dït** (H) "big" → **lɛ̀ɛi dìt** (L-L) "big animal"

The high tone of **dït** becomes low when following a low-toned noun.

## Morphology

### Nouns

Dinka nouns are classified into different gender classes, which affect agreement patterns with adjectives and verbs. The gender system is complex and not fully predictable, but some general patterns exist.

#### Number

Nouns in Dinka have singular and plural forms. The pluralization process can involve various changes:

1. Suffix addition:
   - **thòn** "bull" → **thòòk** "bulls"
   - **tík** "woman" → **tíɣɔ̀ɔk** "women"

2. Vowel alternation:
   - **ɣɔ̀ɔk** "cow" → **ɣòk** "cows"
   - **dhìɛ̀t** "bird" → **dhɔ̀ɔt** "birds"

3. Tonal changes:
   - **mòc** "man" → **mḯic** "men"
   - **wèŋ** "cow" → **wéŋ** "cows"

4. Combinations of the above:
   - **tìik** "girl" → **tɔ́ɔk** "girls"

#### Case

Dinka has a nominative-accusative case system, but case marking is primarily shown through word order and verb agreement rather than noun inflection.

#### Possession

Possession is typically indicated by juxtaposition, with the possessor following the possessed noun:

**luäk mòc** "man's hut"
hut man

For pronominal possession, suffixes are added to the noun:

- **meth** "child"
  - **methdiɛ̀** "my child"
  - **methdu** "your child"
  - **methde** "his/her child"
  - **methda** "our child"
  - **methduɔ̀ɔn** "your (pl.) child"

#### Verb Grades

Dinka verbs have different "grades" that indicate voice and valency:

1. First grade: basic intransitive or transitive
2. Second grade: derived transitive
3. Third grade: derived intransitive or passive

Example:
- **lèec** "to walk" (1st grade)
- **lɛ̀ɛc** "to make walk" (2nd grade)
- **lɛ̌ɛc** "to be walked" (3rd grade)

#### Tense and Aspect

Dinka uses a combination of verb inflection and auxiliary verbs to express tense and aspect:

1. Present:
   **Ɣɛ́ɛn càm** "I eat"

2. Past:
   **Ɣɛ́ɛn cí càm** "I ate"

3. Future:
   **Ɣɛ́ɛn bí càm** "I will eat"

4. Progressive:
   **Ɣɛ́ɛn ɣɔ̀ɔc càm** "I am eating"

5. Perfective:

- **Yḯin càm** "You eat"
- **Yén càm** "He/she eats"
- **Ɣók càmkú** "We eat"
- **Wék càmké** "You (pl.) eat"

### Adverbs

Adverbs in Dinka can be derived from adjectives or exist as independent lexical items:

- **apɛi** "very, much"
- **arɛɛr** "slowly"

"He walks slowly"

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Dinka is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):

"The man eats meat"

However, Dinka allows for considerable flexibility in word order for emphasis or topicalization:

**Rïŋ acàm mòc**
meat eat-3SG man
"The meat, the man eats it"

### Topic-Comment Structure

Dinka often uses a topic-comment structure, where the topic is fronted and followed by a comment:

"This child, he has returned home"

### Negation

Negation in Dinka is typically expressed using the particle **cïï** before the verb:

**Mòc cïï rïŋ càm**
man NEG meat eat
"The man does not eat meat"

### Questions

Yes-no questions are formed by adding the particle **ye** at the end of a statement:

**Yïn càm rïŋ ye?**
you eat meat Q
"Do you eat meat?"

Wh-questions use interrogative words in situ:

**Yïn càm ŋö?**
you eat what
"What do you eat?"

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Dinka are introduced by the relative pronoun **yen** and follow the noun they modify:

**Mòc yen cí rïŋ càm**

"The man who ate the meat"

### Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences in Dinka use the conjunction **na** ("if"):

**Na tuɔ̀l deŋ, ɣɛ́ɛn cïï la dom**

## Writing System

Historically, Dinka was an oral language without a writing system. In the 20th century, various writing systems were developed:

1. Latin-based orthography: The most widely used system today, developed by missionaries and linguists.

2. Arabic-based orthography: Used in some areas due to Islamic influence.

3. Indigenous script: A syllabary called "Dinka Rek Alphabet" was invented by Abdelgabar Gumaa Abdelgabar in the 1950s but has limited use.

The Latin-based orthography uses the following special characters:

- **ä, ë, ï, ö, ɛ, ɔ** for vowels
- **ɣ, ŋ** for consonants
- Diacritical marks for tones: **á** (high), **à** (low), **â** (falling), **ǎ** (rising)

Example text in the Latin-based orthography:

**Raan ëbɛ̈n acï dhiëëth ke lääu nhom ku le gup duɔ̈ɔ̈r ciɛ̈ɛ̈ŋ. Keek aacï yiëk puɔ̈u ku nhialic ku aabï rëër ke cït mïth ë tim.**

"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood."
