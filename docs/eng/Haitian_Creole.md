# Haitian Creole

Haitian Creole (Kreyòl ayisyen) is a French-based creole language spoken by about 10-12 million people, primarily in Haiti. It is one of Haiti's two official languages, alongside French. Haitian Creole developed from contact between French colonists and African slaves in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) during the 17th and 18th centuries.

- **ou** represents /u/: **jou** [ʒu] (day)
- **è** represents /ɛ/: **frè** [frɛ] (brother)
- **ò** represents /ɔ/: **pòt** [pɔt] (door)
- Nasal vowels are represented by adding 'n': **pan** [pã] (breakdown), **pen** [pɛ̃] (bread)

## Grammar

Definite article:
- **la** (singular): **liv la** (the book)

The definite article comes after the noun:
- **chat la** (the cat)

Indefinite article:

Possessive constructions use **de** (of):
- **liv David la** (David's book, literally "book of David the")
- **kay mesye a** (the man's house, literally "house of man the")

### Pronouns

### Serial Verb Constructions

Haitian Creole uses serial verb constructions, where multiple verbs are used in sequence without conjunctions:

Given Haiti's bilingual situation, code-switching between Haitian Creole and French is common, especially among educated speakers. This can occur within sentences or between sentences:

- **Mwen prale nan market la pou achte quelques fruits.** (I'm going to the market to buy some fruits.)
- **Li di m konsa, "Je ne comprends pas pourquoi ou fè sa."** (He told me, "I don't understand why you did that.")

## Dialects and Variation

While Haitian Creole is relatively uniform across Haiti, there are some regional variations:

1. Northern dialect: Spoken in Cap-Haïtien and surrounding areas. It tends to be more conservative and closer to French in some aspects.

2. Central dialect: Spoken in Port-au-Prince and considered the standard form.

3. Southern dialect: Spoken in Les Cayes and other southern regions. It has some unique vocabulary and pronunciations.

Examples of dialectal differences:

- "Now" is **kounye a** in the standard dialect, but **konnyè a** in the north.
- "To give" is **bay** in most of Haiti, but **ban** in some northern areas.

## Phonological Processes

Haitian Creole exhibits several phonological processes in connected speech:

1. Elision: Vowels are often dropped between consonants, especially in fast speech.
   Example: **pou ale** → **prale** (to go)

2. Assimilation: Sounds may change to become more similar to neighboring sounds.
   Example: **nan** + **kay** → **nan kay** [nãŋkaj] (in the house)

3. Liaison: In some cases, final consonants that are usually silent may be pronounced when followed by a vowel.
   Example: **gwo** + **anana** → **gwo zanana** [gwo zanana] (big pineapple)

## Tone and Intonation

While Haitian Creole is not a tonal language like some African languages, intonation plays a crucial role in conveying meaning:

- Statements typically have a falling intonation at the end:
  **Mwen ale lakay.** ↘️ (I went home.)

- Yes/no questions often have a rising intonation:
  **Ou vle ale?** ↗️ (Do you want to go?)

- Wh-questions usually have a falling intonation:
  **Ki kote ou prale?** ↘️ (Where are you going?)

## Reduplication

Reduplication is a common feature in Haitian Creole, often used for emphasis or to indicate intensity:

- **piti** (small) → **piti piti** (very small)

- **vit** (fast) → **vit vit** (very fast)

Example: **Li mache dousman dousman.** (He walked very slowly.)

## Compound Words

Haitian Creole forms compound words in various ways:

1. Noun + Noun:

3. Verb + Noun:
   - **kassav** (cassava bread, from "kase" to break + "av" root)

## Affixation

While not as productive as in some languages, Haitian Creole does use some affixes:

Prefixes:
- **de-**: indicates negation or reversal
  Example: **fè** (to do) → **defè** (to undo)

- **re-**: indicates repetition
  Example: **kòmanse** (to begin) → **rekòmanse** (to begin again)

Suffixes:
- **-è**: forms agent nouns
  Example: **travay** (to work) → **travayè** (worker)

- **-man**: forms adverbs from adjectives
  Example: **dousman** (slowly) from **dous** (sweet)

## Borrowing and Neologisms

  (The donkey works, the horse gallops. - One person does the work, another gets the credit.)

## Politeness and Formality

While Haitian Creole doesn't have a formal "you" like French "vous", politeness is expressed through other means:

- Using titles: **Mesye** (Mr.), **Madanm** (Mrs.), **Matmwazèl** (Miss)
  Example: **Bonjou, Mesye Jan.** (Hello, Mr. John.)

- Adding **souple** (please) to requests:
  **Ban m dlo a, souple.** (Give me the water, please.)

2. Derivation: **travay** (work) → **travayè** (worker)
3. Borrowing: **telefòn** (telephone)
4. Calquing: **gratsyèl** (skyscraper, calque of English "sky-scraper")

## Discourse Markers

Haitian Creole uses various discourse markers to structure conversation:

- **enben** (well, so)

- **kidonk** (therefore)
- **sepandan** (however)

Example: **Mwen te vle ale. Sepandan, lapli te tonbe.** (I wanted to go. However, it rained.)
