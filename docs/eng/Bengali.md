# Bengali

Bengali (বাংলা, romanized: Bangla) is an Indo-Aryan language primarily spoken in Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. It is the official language of Bangladesh and one of the 22 scheduled languages of India. With approximately 230 million native speakers and 300 million total speakers worldwide, Bengali is one of the most spoken languages globally.

## Writing System

Bengali uses its own script, known as Bengali script or Bangla lipi (বাংলা লিপি). It is an abugida, meaning each consonant has an inherent vowel which can be changed using vowel diacritics.

## Pronunciation

### Vowel length

Unlike some other Indo-Aryan languages, Bengali does not have phonemic vowel length. The vowels ই (i) and ঈ (ī) are both pronounced [i], while উ (u) and ঊ (ū) are both pronounced [u].

### Consonant clusters

Bengali allows consonant clusters, but they are generally limited to two consonants. Examples:

- **প্রথম** [prɔt̪ʰom] “first”
- **স্বাধীনতা** [ʂad̪ʱinot̪a] “independence”

### Vowel harmony

Bengali exhibits a form of vowel harmony where the vowels /e/ and /o/ in a word's first syllable can influence the pronunciation of /æ/ in subsequent syllables. For example:

- **দেখা** [d̪ekʰa] “to see” (infinitive)
- **দেখে** [d̪ekʰe] “sees” (3rd person)

### Nasalization

Vowels can be nasalized when followed by ং (anusvara) or ঁ (candrabindu). For example:

- **বাঁশ** [bãɕ] “bamboo”
- **চাঁদ** [tɕãd̪] “moon”

## Grammar

### Nouns

Bengali nouns are inflected for number, case, and definiteness.

#### Gender

Unlike many Indo-European languages, Bengali does not have grammatical gender. Nouns are not classified as masculine, feminine, or neuter.

#### Number

Bengali has two numbers: singular and plural. The plural is typically formed by adding -রা (-ra) for animate nouns and -গুলো (-gulo) or -গুলি (-guli) for inanimate nouns.

Examples:
- **ছেলে** (chele) “boy” → **ছেলেরা** (chelera) “boys”
- **বই** (boi) “book” → **বইগুলো** (boigulo) “books”

#### Case

Bengali has six cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, and instrumental. The nominative case is unmarked, while other cases are formed by adding postpositions.

Examples:
- Nominative: **ছেলে** (chele) “boy”
- Accusative: **ছেলেকে** (cheleke) “to the boy”
- Genitive: **ছেলের** (cheler) “of the boy”
- Dative: **ছেলেকে** (cheleke) “to the boy”
- Locative: **ছেলেতে** (chelete) “in/on the boy”
- Instrumental: **ছেলে দিয়ে** (chele diye) “by means of the boy”

#### Definiteness

Bengali uses the suffix -টা (-ta) or -টি (-ti) to indicate definiteness for singular nouns, and -গুলো (-gulo) or -গুলি (-guli) for plural nouns.

Examples:
- **বই** (boi) “book” → **বইটা** (boita) “the book”
- **বইগুলো** (boigulo) “the books”

### Pronouns

Bengali pronouns are inflected for person, number, and case. Here are the personal pronouns in the nominative case:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **আমি** (ami) | **আমরা** (amra) |
| 2nd (informal) | **তুই** (tui) | **তোরা** (tora) |
| 2nd (familiar) | **তুমি** (tumi) | **তোমরা** (tomra) |
| 2nd (formal) | **আপনি** (apni) | **আপনারা** (apnara) |

Demonstrative pronouns:
- **এটা** (eta) “this”
- **ওটা** (ota) “that”

- **ওগুলো** (ogulo) “those”

Interrogative pronouns:
- **কে** (ke) “who”
- **কী** (ki) “what”

### Adjectives

Bengali adjectives are typically invariable and precede the nouns they modify.

Examples:
- **লাল বই** (lal boi) “red book”
- **বড় বাড়ি** (boro bari) “big house”

Comparatives and superlatives are formed using **আরো** (aro) “more” and **সবচেয়ে** (sobceye) “most” respectively:

- **বড়** (boro) “big” → **আরো বড়** (aro boro) “bigger” → **সবচেয়ে বড়** (sobceye boro) “biggest”

### Verbs

Bengali verbs are highly inflected, showing tense, aspect, mood, and person.

#### Verb classes

Bengali verbs can be divided into several classes based on their stem vowels:

1. আ-কার (a-kar): stem ends in া (a)
2. ই-কার (i-kar): stem ends in ি (i)
3. এ-কার (e-kar): stem ends in ে (e)

#### Tenses

Bengali has three main tenses: present, past, and future.

Present tense:

#### Aspects

Bengali has several aspects, including simple, progressive, perfect, and habitual.

Progressive aspect is formed using the verb **থাকা** (thaka) “to stay”:
- **আমি যাচ্ছি** (ami jacchi) “I am going”

Perfect aspect is formed using the verb **আছে** (ache) “to have”:
- **আমি গিয়েছি** (ami giyechi) “I have gone”

Habitual aspect is formed using the suffix -তাম (-tam) in the past tense:
- **আমি যেতাম** (ami jetam) “I used to go”

#### Moods

Bengali has several moods, including indicative, imperative, and subjunctive.

Imperative mood:
- **যাও** (jao) “Go!” (informal)

Subjunctive mood:

#### Negation

Verbs are negated by adding **না** (na) after the verb:
- **আমি যাই না** (ami jai na) “I don’t go”
- **আমি যাব না** (ami jabo na) “I won’t go”

### Sentence Structure

Bengali typically follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order.

Example:

I book read
“I read a book.”

However, word order can be flexible for emphasis or in poetry.

- **বাড়িতে** (barite) “in the house”
- **টেবিলের উপরে** (tebiler upore) “on the table”

### Compounds

Bengali frequently uses compound verbs, where two verb stems are combined to express complex actions or add nuance:

- **বলে দেওয়া** (bole deoa) “to tell” (lit. “say” + “give”)

### Honorifics

Bengali has an extensive system of honorifics, reflected in pronouns, verbs, and certain nouns. There are different levels of formality and respect:

- Informal: used with close friends and younger family members
- Familiar: used with peers and relatives
- Formal: used with elders, strangers, and in professional settings

Example (verb “to do”):
- Informal: **তুই কর** (tui koro)
- Familiar: **তুমি কর** (tumi koro)
- Formal: **আপনি করেন** (apni koren)
