# Belarusian

Belarusian (беларуская мова, biełaruskaja mova) is an East Slavic language spoken by approximately 5 million people, primarily in Belarus. It is closely related to Russian and Ukrainian, with some influence from Polish due to historical factors. Belarusian uses the Cyrillic alphabet, with some modifications specific to the language.

## Alphabet and Pronunciation

The Belarusian alphabet consists of 32 letters:

А а, Б б, В в, Г г, Д д, Е е, Ё ё, Ж ж, З з, І і, Й й, К к, Л л, М м, Н н, О о, П п, Р р, С с, Т т, У у, Ў ў, Ф ф, Х х, Ц ц, Ч ч, Ш ш, Ы ы, Ь ь, Э э, Ю ю, Я я

## Morphology

### Nouns

Belarusian nouns have three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural), and six cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, prepositional).

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Belarusian is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), but it can be flexible due to the case system.

Examples:
- **Я чытаю кнігу.** (I read a book.)
- **Кнігу чытаю я.** (It is I who reads the book.)

### Questions

Questions can be formed by:

1. Intonation:
   **Ты чытаеш кнігу?** (Are you reading a book?)

2. Question words:
   **Што ты чытаеш?** (What are you reading?)
   **Дзе ты жывеш?** (Where do you live?)

### Negation

Negation is formed by adding **не** before the verb:

**Я не чытаю кнігу.** (I am not reading a book.)

Double negation is common in Belarusian:

**Ніхто нічога не ведае.** (Nobody knows anything.)

### Impersonal Constructions

Impersonal constructions are common in Belarusian:

**Мне холадна.** (I am cold. Literally: To me [it is] cold.)
**Трэба працаваць.** (It is necessary to work.)

## Vocabulary

Belarusian vocabulary has been influenced by various languages throughout its history:

1. Native Slavic words:
   **дзень** (day), **ноч** (night), **вада** (water)

2. Loanwords from Polish:
   **цыбуля** (onion), **кава** (coffee)

3. Loanwords from Russian:
   **самалёт** (airplane), **завод** (factory)

4. Loanwords from German:
   **цукар** (sugar), **дах** (roof)

5. Loanwords from Latin and Greek (often through other languages):
   **універсітэт** (university), **тэатр** (theater)

### Common Phrases

- **Добры дзень** - Good day
- **Да пабачэння** - Goodbye
- **Дзякуй** - Thank you
- **Калі ласка** - Please / You're welcome
- **Як справы?** - How are you?
- **Мяне завуць...** - My name is...

## Dialectal Variations

Belarusian has several dialects, broadly divided into two main groups:

1. Southwest Belarusian dialects
2. Northeast Belarusian dialects

The standard literary language is based primarily on the central Minsk dialect, which shares features with both groups.

Some dialectal features include:

- Akannie vs. Okannie: In some southern dialects, unstressed 'o' is not reduced to 'a'.
- Dzekanie and Tsekanie: In some dialects, 'дз' and 'ц' are used where standard Belarusian uses 'д' and 'т'.
- Hardening of 'р': In some dialects, 'р' is always hard, even in positions where it should be soft in standard Belarusian.

## Orthography

Belarusian orthography is largely phonemic, meaning that words are generally spelled as they are pronounced. However, there are some important rules to note:

1. Akannie and Yakannie are reflected in spelling:
   **малако** (milk), not **молоко**
   **вясна** (spring), not **весна**

2. The letter 'ў' is used instead of 'в' or 'л' in certain positions:
   **воўк** (wolf), not **волк**
   **пайшоў** (he went), not **пайшов**

3. Assimilation of consonants is often reflected in spelling:
   **смяяцца** (to laugh), not **смяятся**
   **малацьба** (threshing), not **малатьба**

4. The soft sign 'ь' is used to indicate palatalization:
   **соль** (salt)
   **дзень** (day)

## Grammar Peculiarities

### Vocative Case

While not officially recognized as a separate case, Belarusian retains traces of the vocative case for addressing people:

**Іван** (Ivan) → **Іване** (Oh, Ivan!)
**Алеся** (Alesya) → **Алесю** (Oh, Alesya!)

### Reflexive Verbs

Reflexive verbs are formed by adding the particle **-ся** (-sia) to the end of the verb:

**мыць** (to wash) → **мыцца** (to wash oneself)
**вучыць** (to teach) → **вучыцца** (to learn, to study)

### Aspect Pairs

Most Belarusian verbs come in aspect pairs, with one perfective and one imperfective verb:

**рабіць** (to do, imperfective) - **зрабіць** (to do, perfective)
**пісаць** (to write, imperfective) - **напісаць** (to write, perfective)

### Verbs of Motion

Belarusian, like other Slavic languages, has a complex system of verbs of motion. These verbs come in pairs, with one verb indicating unidirectional motion and the other multidirectional motion:

**ісці** (to go on foot, unidirectional) - **хадзіць** (to go on foot, multidirectional)
**ехаць** (to go by vehicle, unidirectional) - **ездзіць** (to go by vehicle, multidirectional)

### Numbers and Case

Numbers in Belarusian interact with nouns in complex ways:

- After 1, nouns are in the nominative singular
- After 2-4, nouns are in the genitive singular
- After 5 and above, nouns are in the genitive plural

Example:
**адзін стол** (one table)
**два сталы** (two tables)
**пяць сталоў** (five tables)

### Diminutives

Belarusian makes extensive use of diminutive suffixes, which can express smallness, endearment, or sometimes contempt:

**кот** (cat) → **коцік** (little cat, kitty)
**дзяўчына** (girl) → **дзяўчынка** (little girl)
**хлеб** (bread) → **хлебец** (small loaf of bread)

### Augmentatives

In contrast to diminutives, augmentative suffixes can be used to indicate large size or sometimes negative connotations:

**дом** (house) → **дамішча** (huge house)
**рука** (hand) → **ручышча** (big hand)

## Syntax Peculiarities

### Impersonal Sentences

Belarusian often uses impersonal constructions where English might use a personal subject:

**Мне не спіцца.** (I can’t sleep. Literally: To me it doesn’t sleep.)
**Яму пашанцавала.** (He got lucky. Literally: To him it lucked.)

### Genitive of Negation

When a transitive verb is negated, the direct object often appears in the genitive case instead of the accusative:

**Я чытаю кнігу.** (I'm reading a book. - Accusative)
**Я не чытаю кнігі.** (I'm not reading a book. - Genitive)

### Predicative Adverbs

Belarusian uses predicative adverbs to express states or conditions:

**Мне сумна.** (I'm sad. Literally: To me [it is] sad.)
**Тут холадна.** (It's cold here. Literally: Here [it is] cold.)

### Participles and Verbal Adverbs

Belarusian has a system of participles and verbal adverbs that can be used to create complex sentences:

Present active participle: **чытаючы** (reading)
Past active participle: **прачытаўшы** (having read)
Present passive participle: **чытаемы** (being read)
Past passive participle: **прачытаны** (having been read)

Verbal adverb: **чытаючы** (while reading)

Example: **Чытаючы кнігу, я заўважыў цікавы факт.** (While reading the book, I noticed an interesting fact.)

## Lexical Peculiarities

### False Friends with Russian

While Belarusian and Russian are closely related, there are many words that look similar but have different meanings:

**краска** - flower in Belarusian, paint in Russian
**наведаць** - to visit in Belarusian, to learn in Russian
**чарга** - queue in Belarusian, turn in Russian

### Unique Belarusian Words

Some words are unique to Belarusian or have a distinct Belarusian flavor:

**бульба** - potato (compare to Russian **картошка**)
**імпэт** - enthusiasm, impulse
**шчыры** - sincere, genuine

### Idioms and Proverbs

Belarusian has many colorful idioms and proverbs:

**Не мець ні даху, ні падаху** (To have neither roof nor under-roof) - To be completely destitute
**Язык да Кіева давядзе** (The tongue will lead you to Kyiv) - Asking will get you everywhere
**Шыта белымі ніткамі** (Sewn with white threads) - Poorly concealed, obvious

## Phonological Processes

### Assimilation

Consonants often assimilate in voicing and palatalization:

**з братам** [z bratam] (with brother)
**з сястрой** [s sʲastroj] (with sister)

### Epenthesis

An epenthetic vowel is sometimes inserted to break up consonant clusters:

**агонь** [aɣonʲ] (fire) → **агеньчык** [aɣɛnʲtʂɨk] (little fire)

### Final Devoicing

Voiced obstruents are devoiced at the end of words:

**сад** [sat] (garden)
**мароз** [marɔs] (frost)

## Stress

Stress in Belarusian is phonemic and can distinguish between otherwise identical words:

**замак** (castle) vs. **замок** (lock)
**мука** (flour) vs. **мука** (torment)

Stress can also shift in different forms of the same word:

**рука** (hand, nom. sing.) → **рукі** (hands, nom. plur.)
**галава** (head, nom. sing.) → **галовы** (heads, nom. plur.)

## Sentence Structure

### Topicalization

Belarusian allows for flexible word order to emphasize different parts of the sentence:

**Я купіў кнігу ўчора.** (I bought a book yesterday. - Neutral)
**Кнігу я купіў учора.** (It was a book that I bought yesterday. - Emphasis on “book”)
**Учора я купіў кнігу.** (It was yesterday that I bought a book. - Emphasis on “yesterday”)

### Cleft Sentences

Cleft sentences can be used for emphasis:

**Гэта была яна, хто мне дапамагла.** (It was she who helped me.)

### Subordinate Clauses

Belarusian uses a variety of conjunctions to introduce subordinate clauses:

**Я ведаю, што ён прыйдзе.** (I know that he will come.)
**Калі ён прыйдзе, мы пачнем.** (When he comes, we will begin.)
**Я хачу, каб ты прыйшоў.** (I want you to come. Literally: I want that you would come.)

## Register and Style

### Formal vs. Informal Speech

Belarusian distinguishes between formal and informal address:

Formal: **Вы** (you, plural or polite singular)
Informal: **ты** (you, singular)

### Literary vs. Colloquial Language

There can be significant differences between literary and colloquial Belarusian:

Literary: **Я не ведаю.** (I don’t know.)
Colloquial: **Я не знаю.** (I don’t know.)

### Russianisms

Due to the historical influence of Russian, many Belarusian speakers mix Russian words into their speech. This phenomenon is sometimes called “трасянка” (trasianka):

Standard Belarusian: **бульба** (potato)
Trasianka: **картошка** (Russian word for potato)

## Orthographic Reforms

Belarusian orthography has undergone several reforms:

1. 1933 reform: Aligned Belarusian spelling more closely with Russian
2. 1957 reform: Simplified some spelling rules
3. Post-1991: Some attempts to return to pre-1933 spelling norms, leading to the existence of two parallel orthographic traditions (official and “classical”)

Example:
Official: **здароўе** (health)
Classical: **здароўе**

In conclusion, Belarusian is a rich and complex language with many unique features. While it shares many characteristics with other East Slavic languages, particularly Russian and Ukrainian, it has its own distinct phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon that set it apart as a separate language.
