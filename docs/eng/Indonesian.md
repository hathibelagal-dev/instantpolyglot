# Indonesian

Indonesian, also known as Bahasa Indonesia, is the official language of Indonesia. It is spoken by over 200 million people, making it one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. Indonesian is a standardized form of Malay, which has been used as a lingua franca in the Indonesian archipelago for centuries.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Indonesian uses the Latin alphabet and has a relatively straightforward spelling system. Most letters are pronounced similarly to their English counterparts, with a few exceptions.

### Vowels

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| a | [a] as in "father" |
| e | [ə] as in "about" or [e] as in "bed" |
| i | [i] as in "machine" |
| o | [o] as in "go" |
| u | [u] as in "flute" |

### Consonants

Most consonants are pronounced similarly to English, with some exceptions:

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| c | [tʃ] as in "church" |
| g | always hard [g] as in "go" |
| j | [dʒ] as in "judge" |
| ng | [ŋ] as in "sing" |
| ny | [ɲ] similar to Spanish "ñ" |
| r | rolled [r] |

| ai | [ai] as in "eye" |
| au | [au] as in "now" |
| oi | [oi] as in "boy" |

### Stress

Stress in Indonesian is generally on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable of a word, unless the penultimate syllable contains a schwa [ə], in which case the stress falls on the last syllable.

Examples:
- **buku** (book) [ˈbuku]
- **selamat** (safe, congratulations) [səˈlamat]
- **bekerja** (to work) [bəˈkərdʒa]

## Morphology

Indonesian has a rich system of affixes (prefixes, suffixes, and circumfixes) that can significantly alter the meaning and grammatical function of words.

### Prefixes

Some common prefixes include:

1. **me-**: forms active verbs
   - **baca** (read) → **membaca** (to read)
   - **tulis** (write) → **menulis** (to write)

2. **ber-**: forms intransitive verbs or indicates possession
   - **main** (play) → **bermain** (to play)
   - **anak** (child) → **beranak** (to have children)

3. **pe-**: forms nouns denoting people or tools
   - **tani** (farm) → **petani** (farmer)
   - **ukur** (measure) → **pengukur** (measuring tool)

4. **ke-**: forms ordinal numbers
   - **dua** (two) → **kedua** (second)
   - **tiga** (three) → **ketiga** (third)

### Suffixes

Common suffixes include:

1. **-kan**: forms transitive verbs
   - **besar** (big) → **besarkan** (to enlarge)
   - **pindah** (move) → **pindahkan** (to move something)

2. **-i**: forms transitive verbs, often with repetitive or intensive meaning
   - **ajar** (teach) → **ajari** (to teach repeatedly)
   - **suka** (like) → **sukai** (to like/favor)

3. **-an**: forms nouns
   - **makan** (eat) → **makanan** (food)
   - **pikir** (think) → **pikiran** (thought)

### Circumfixes

Circumfixes are combinations of prefixes and suffixes applied simultaneously:

1. **ke-an**: forms abstract nouns
   - **baik** (good) → **kebaikan** (goodness)
   - **indah** (beautiful) → **keindahan** (beauty)

2. **pe-an**: forms nouns indicating a place or process
   - **didik** (educate) → **pendidikan** (education)
   - **parkir** (park) → **perparkiran** (parking area)

## Nouns

Indonesian nouns do not inflect for number or gender. Plurality can be indicated through context, reduplication, or quantity words.

### Reduplication

Nouns can be reduplicated to indicate plurality or variety:
- **buku** (book) → **buku-buku** (books)
- **buah** (fruit) → **buah-buahan** (various fruits)

### Quantity words

Quantity words are used with nouns to indicate number:
- **dua orang** (two people)
- **beberapa buku** (several books)
- **banyak mobil** (many cars)

### Measure words

Indonesian uses measure words (classifiers) with numbers and certain quantifiers:
- **dua ekor kucing** (two cats, literally "two tails of cat")
- **tiga buah apel** (three apples, literally "three fruits of apple")
- **lima orang murid** (five students, literally "five persons of student")

Common measure words include:
- **orang** for people
- **ekor** for animals
- **buah** for fruits and large objects

## Pronouns

### Personal pronouns

Indonesian personal pronouns vary based on formality and social status:

| Person | Informal | Formal |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st singular | **aku**, **gue** (colloquial) | **saya** |
| 2nd singular | **kamu**, **lu** (colloquial) | **Anda** |
| 3rd singular | **dia**, **ia** | - |
| 1st plural (inclusive) | **kita** | - |
| 1st plural (exclusive) | **kami** | - |
| 2nd plural | **kalian** | - |
| 3rd plural | **mereka** | - |

The distinction between inclusive "we" (**kita**, including the listener) and exclusive "we" (**kami**, excluding the listener) is important in Indonesian.

### Possessive pronouns

Possessive pronouns are formed by adding the pronoun after the noun:
- **buku saya** (my book)
- **rumah dia** (his/her house)
- **mobil mereka** (their car)

For the second person singular, **-mu** can be suffixed to the noun:

- **bukunya** (his/her book)

### Demonstrative pronouns

## Verbs

Indonesian verbs do not conjugate for person, number, or tense. Tense and aspect are typically indicated through context or time markers.

### Active voice

Active verbs often use the prefix **me-**:
- **baca** (read) → **membaca** (to read)
- **tulis** (write) → **menulis** (to write)

The **me-** prefix changes form depending on the initial letter of the root word:

However, the word order can be flexible, especially in colloquial speech:
