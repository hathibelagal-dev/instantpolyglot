# Hawaiian

Hawaiian is a Polynesian language spoken by about 24,000 people, primarily in the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is closely related to other Polynesian languages such as Tahitian, Maori, and Samoan. Hawaiian was the primary language of Hawaii until the late 19th century, when its use declined due to political changes. However, revitalization efforts since the 1970s have led to an increase in speakers and its use in education.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Hawaiian uses a Latin alphabet with 13 letters: 5 vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and 8 consonants (h, k, l, m, n, p, w, ʻ). The letter ʻ represents the glottal stop and is called ʻokina in Hawaiian.

### Vowels

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| a | [a] |
| e | [e] |
| i | [i] |
| o | [o] |
| u | [u] |

Vowel length is phonemic in Hawaiian. Long vowels are written with a macron (kahakō) over the vowel: ā, ē, ī, ō, ū.

### Consonants

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| h | [h] |
| k | [k] |
| l | [l] |
| m | [m] |
| n | [n] |
| p | [p] |
| w | [w] or [v] |
| ʻ | [ʔ] (glottal stop) |

The pronunciation of 'w' varies:
- [w] at the beginning of a word or after 'a'
- [v] after 'i' or 'e'
- [w] or [v] after 'u' or 'o'

### Stress

Stress in Hawaiian words generally falls on the second-to-last syllable. However, if the word contains a long vowel (marked with a macron), the stress falls on that vowel.

Examples:
- **aloha** [əˈlohə] (hello, love)
- **Hawaiʻi** [həˈvɐjʔi] (Hawaii)
- **kāne** [ˈkaːne] (man)

### Phonotactics

Hawaiian syllable structure is (C)V(V), meaning a syllable can consist of:
- A single vowel
- A consonant followed by a vowel
- A vowel followed by another vowel (diphthong)

Examples:
- **a.lo.ha** (CV.CV.CV)
- **ai** (VV)
- **pau** (CVV)

## Morphology

Hawaiian is an isolating language, meaning that grammatical relationships are primarily expressed through separate words rather than inflections. However, it does use affixes for some grammatical functions.

### Nouns

Nouns in Hawaiian do not inflect for number, gender, or case. Plurality is typically indicated by separate words or context.

Examples:
- **ke kanaka** (the person)
- **nā kānaka** (the people)

#### Determiners

Hawaiian uses determiners before nouns to indicate definiteness and number:

- **ke/ka** (the, singular)
- **nā** (the, plural)
- **kekahi** (a, some)

Examples:
- **ke keiki** (the child)
- **ka wahine** (the woman)
- **nā manu** (the birds)
- **kekahi pua** (a flower)

#### Possessives

Possession is indicated by possessive particles that come before the noun. These particles indicate both possession and definiteness:

- **koʻu/kaʻu** (my)
- **kou/kāu** (your, singular)
- **kona/kāna** (his/her/its)
- **ko mākou/kā mākou** (our, exclusive)
- **ko kākou/kā kākou** (our, inclusive)
- **ko ʻoukou/kā ʻoukou** (your, plural)
- **ko lākou/kā lākou** (their)

The choice between 'o' and 'a' forms depends on the relationship between the possessor and the possessed:
- 'O' forms are used for inalienable possession (body parts, family members, etc.)
- 'A' forms are used for alienable possession (acquired objects)

Examples:
- **koʻu makuahine** (my mother)
- **kaʻu puke** (my book)
- **kona hale** (his/her house)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Hawaiian distinguish between singular, dual, and plural, as well as inclusive and exclusive first person plural:

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st (excl.) | **au/wau** | **māua** | **mākou** |
| 1st (incl.) | - | **kāua** | **kākou** |
| 2nd | **ʻoe** | **ʻolua** | **ʻoukou** |
| 3rd | **ia** | **lāua** | **lākou** |

Examples:
- **Ua hele au i ke kula.** (I went to school.)
- **E hele ana lākou i ka hale.** (They are going to the house.)

### Verbs

Hawaiian verbs do not conjugate for person or number. Tense, aspect, and mood are indicated by separate particles.

#### Tense/Aspect Markers

- **ua** (perfect/past)
- **e ... ana** (progressive/future)
- **ke ... nei** (present progressive)

Examples:
- **Ua ʻai au.** (I ate.)
- **E ʻai ana au.** (I will eat.)
- **Ke ʻai nei au.** (I am eating.)

#### Stative Verbs

Some verbs in Hawaiian, particularly those describing states or conditions, use **ua** to indicate a present state:

- **Ua ola.** (It is alive.)
- **Ua maika'i.** (It is good.)

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed by using **e** before the verb:

- **E ʻai!** (Eat!)
- **E hele!** (Go!)

#### Passive Voice

The passive voice is formed by adding **ʻia** to the end of the verb:

- **Ua hānai ʻia ke keiki.** (The child was fed.)
- **E mālama ʻia ka ʻāina.** (The land will be cared for.)

### Adjectives

In Hawaiian, many words that express qualities or states can function as both adjectives and verbs. When used as adjectives, they typically follow the noun they modify.

Examples:
- **ka pua nani** (the beautiful flower)
- **ke keiki ʻōpio** (the young child)

Comparison is expressed using **aku** (more) and **loa** (most):

- **nui aku** (bigger)
- **nui loa** (biggest)

Example:
- **Ua nui aku kēia pua ma mua o kēlā pua.** (This flower is bigger than that flower.)

### Adverbs

Many adverbs in Hawaiian are formed by reduplication of adjectives or by using particles:

- **wikiwiki** (quickly, from **wiki** - quick)
- **maika'i loa** (very well)

Example:
- **Ua holo wikiwiki ka lio.** (The horse ran quickly.)

## Syntax

Hawaiian generally follows a Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) word order, which is common among Polynesian languages.

### Basic Sentence Structure

A typical Hawaiian sentence follows this pattern:

[Tense/Aspect Marker] + Verb + Subject + Object

Example:
- **Ua heluhelu ke keiki i ka puke.** (The child read the book.)
  [Perfect] + read + the child + [object marker] + the book

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding **anei** after the verb:

- **Ua hele anei ʻoe i ke kula?** (Did you go to school?)

Wh-questions use question words such as:

- **aha** (what)
- **wai** (who)
- **ʻehia** (how many)
- **mahea** (where)
- **pehea** (how)

Example:
- **He aha kēia?** (What is this?)
- **No wai kēia puke?** (Whose book is this?)

### Negation

Negation is expressed using **ʻaʻole** before the verb:

- **ʻAʻole au e hele ana.** (I will not go.)
- **ʻAʻole ia i hāʻawi mai i ke kālā.** (He did not give the money.)

### Prepositions

Hawaiian uses prepositions to indicate relationships between words:

- **i** (to, at, in)
- **ma** (at, in, on)
- **no** (for, about)
- **me** (with)

Examples:
- **Ua hele au i ke kula.** (I went to school.)
- **Ke noho nei ia ma Oʻahu.** (He lives on Oahu.)
- **He puke kēia no nā keiki.** (This is a book for children.)

### Conjunctions

Common conjunctions in Hawaiian include:

- **a** (and)
- **a me** (and)
- **akā** (but)
- **no ka mea** (because)

Example:
- **Ua hele au i ke kula a me ka hale waihona puke.** (I went to school and the library.)

## Vocabulary

Hawaiian vocabulary reflects the traditional culture and environment of Hawaii, with many words related to nature, ocean, and family relationships. The language has also adapted to modern concepts through loanwords and new coinages.

### Numbers

The Hawaiian number system is based on 4 and 10:

- 1-10: **kahi/ʻekahi, lua/ʻelua, kolu/ʻekolu, hā/ʻehā, lima, ono, hiku, walu, iwa, ʻumi**
- 11-19: **ʻumi kūmākahi, ʻumi kūmālua, ...** (ten and one, ten and two, ...)
- 20: **iwakālua** (twenty)
- 21: **iwakālua kūmākahi** (twenty and one)

- **kauka** (doctor, from English “doctor”)
- **pāka** (park)
- **kāmela** (camel)
- **kepakī** (cabbage)
- **kope** (coffee)

### Neologisms

New words have been created for modern concepts, often by combining existing Hawaiian words:

- **lola** (telephone, from **lono** - news, and **laha** - to spread)
- **lolouila** (computer, from **lolo** - brain, and **uila** - electricity)
- **mokulele** (airplane, from **moku** - ship, and **lele** - to fly)

- **Mālama pono** (Take care properly) - A phrase encouraging responsible behavior
- **A hui hou** (Until we meet again) - A common farewell
- **Ua mau ke ea o ka ʻāina i ka pono** (The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness) - The state motto of Hawaii
- **Mai poina** (Don’t forget) - A reminder to remember important things or people

## Reduplication

Reduplication is a common feature in Hawaiian, used to indicate plurality, intensity, or repetition:

- **holoholo** (to go for a walk or ride, from **holo** - to go)
- **ʻāwīwī** (quickly, from **ʻāwī** - quick)

## Honorific Language

Hawaiian has a system of honorific language called **ʻōlelo makamae** (precious language) used to show respect, particularly to aliʻi (chiefs) and other high-ranking individuals:

- Using **lā** after a name or title: **ke aliʻi lā** (the chief)
- Special vocabulary: **inu** (to drink) becomes **waiʻona** when referring to a chief drinking

## Dialectal Variations

While Hawaiian is relatively uniform across the islands, there are some dialectal differences, particularly in vocabulary and pronunciation. For example:

- On Niʻihau, the last Hawaiian-speaking community, [t] is often used instead of [k]
- Some words have different meanings on different islands: **ʻoʻopu** can mean a type of fish on some islands and a type of shrimp on others

## Poetic Language

Hawaiian has a rich tradition of poetic language, including:

- **Kaona**: hidden or layered meanings in words and phrases
- **Mele**: songs or chants, often with complex poetic structures
- **ʻŌlelo Noʻeau**: proverbs or wise sayings

Example of kaona:
**Pua ka wiliwili nanahu ka manō**
(When the wiliwili tree flowers, the shark bites)
Literal meaning: A natural sign that it's dangerous to swim
Kaona: When a person blushes (flowers), they are angry (ready to bite)

## Writing System

The Hawaiian alphabet, called **ka pīʻāpā Hawaiʻi**, was developed in the 1820s by American missionaries in collaboration with Hawaiian scholars. It consists of 13 letters:

Vowels: A, E, I, O, U
Consonants: H, K, L, M, N, P, W, ʻ (ʻokina)

The ʻokina (ʻ) represents a glottal stop, while the kahakō (macron) over vowels indicates a long vowel sound.

Example:
**Ua mau ke ea o ka ʻāina i ka pono**
(The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness)

## Phonological Processes

### Vowel Assimilation

In rapid speech, vowels may assimilate to neighboring vowels:

**ke aliʻi** → [kaliʻi] (the chief)

### Consonant Variation

The pronunciation of 'w' can vary:
- [w] initially and after 'a': **wai** [wai] (water)
- [v] after 'i' and 'e': **ʻiwa** [ʻiva] (nine)
- [w] or [v] after 'u' and 'o': **kauwaʻe** [kauwaʻe] or [kauvaʻe] (to hang)

## Sentence Types

### Equational Sentences

Hawaiian uses equational sentences to express “to be” concepts:

**He kumu ʻo Keola.** (Keola is a teacher.)
[Indefinite article] + teacher + [subject marker] + Keola

## Noun Phrases

Hawaiian noun phrases typically follow this structure:

[Determiner] + [Noun] + [Adjective] + [Prepositional Phrase]

Example:
**ka pua melemele ma ka pā**
(the yellow flower in the yard)

### Compound Nouns

Hawaiian often forms compound nouns by combining two or more words:

- **hale pule** (church, literally “house prayer”)

**I nui ke kālā, ua hiki iaʻu ke kūʻai i ka hale.**
(If I had a lot of money, I could buy the house.)

## Comparative and Superlative

Comparatives are formed using **aku**:

## Nominalization

In Hawaiian, verbs can be nominalized by adding the definite article **ka/ke**:

**ʻaʻole maopopo iaʻu ke kākau ʻana**
(I don’t understand the writing)

Here, **kākau** (to write) becomes a noun “the writing” with the addition of **ke** and **ʻana**.

- **pau** (finished, from Hawaiian **pau**)
- **ono** (delicious, from Hawaiian **ʻono**)

## Traditional Naming Practices

Hawaiian names often have deep meanings and can be quite long. They may describe events, characteristics, or hopes for the child:

- The pronunciation of 'w' can vary between [w] and [v]
- Some speakers may pronounce 'k' as [t], especially on Niʻihau
- The glottal stop (ʻokina) may be omitted in rapid speech

## Language Revitalization

Since the 1970s, there have been significant efforts to revitalize the Hawaiian language:

- Establishment of Hawaiian immersion schools (**Pūnana Leo**)
- Use of Hawaiian in government and official documents
- Hawaiian language media (radio, television, newspapers)
- Integration of Hawaiian words and concepts into everyday English usage in Hawaii

These efforts have led to an increase in Hawaiian speakers and a renewed interest in the language among both Native Hawaiians and others.
