# Ido

Ido is an constructed international auxiliary language created in 1907 as a reformed version of Esperanto. It was designed to be easy to learn and use for international communication, while addressing some perceived flaws in Esperanto. Ido retains much of Esperanto's vocabulary and grammar but introduces changes aimed at greater regularity, clarity, and naturalness.

## Alphabet and Pronunciation

Ido uses a 26-letter Latin alphabet without diacritics:

a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z

### Vowels

| Letter | Pronunciation |
|--------|---------------|
| a | [a] as in “father” |
| e | [e] as in “bed” |
| i | [i] as in “machine” |
| o | [o] as in “go” |
| u | [u] as in “rule” |

Vowels are always pronounced clearly and separately, even when adjacent. For example, **kreao** (creation) is pronounced [kre-a-o].

### Consonants

Most consonants are pronounced as in English, with a few exceptions:

| Letter | Pronunciation |
|--------|---------------|
| c | [ts] as in “cats” |
| g | always hard, as in “go” |
| h | always pronounced, as in “hello” |
| j | [ʒ] as in “measure” |
| q | [k] as in “king” |
| r | trilled or rolled |
| s | always voiceless, as in “song” |
| x | [ks] as in “extra” |
| y | [j] as in “yes” |

### Stress

The stress always falls on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable:

- **pa-RO-lo** (speech)
- **lin-GUO** (language)
- **u-NI-ver-sa-LA** (universal)

## Grammar

### Nouns

All nouns end in -o in the singular and -i in the plural:

- **libro** (book) → **libri** (books)
- **domo** (house) → **domi** (houses)

### Articles

The definite article is **la** for both singular and plural:

- **la libro** (the book)
- **la libri** (the books)

There is no indefinite article; it is implied by the absence of **la**:

- **libro** (a book)
- **libri** (books)

### Adjectives

Adjectives end in -a and do not change for number:

- **bela libro** (beautiful book)
- **bela libri** (beautiful books)

### Adverbs

Adverbs derived from adjectives end in -e:

- **rapida** (quick) → **rapide** (quickly)
- **bona** (good) → **bone** (well)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Singular | Plural |
|----------|--------|
| **me** (I) | **ni** (we) |
| **tu** (you, informal) | **vi** (you, plural or formal) |
| **ilu** (he) | **ili** (they) |
| **elu** (she) | |
| **olu** (it) | |

Possessive adjectives are formed by adding -a to the pronoun:

- **mea libro** (my book)
- **tua domo** (your house)
- **nia lando** (our country)

Reflexive pronoun: **su** (oneself)

- **Me lavas me.** (I wash myself.)
- **Ilu vidis su en la spegulo.** (He saw himself in the mirror.)

### Verbs

Verbs have regular conjugations with no exceptions:

| Tense/Mood | Ending | Example |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Infinitive | -ar | **parolar** (to speak) |
| Present | -as | **me parolas** (I speak) |
| Past | -is | **me parolis** (I spoke) |
| Future | -os | **me parolos** (I will speak) |
| Conditional | -us | **me parolus** (I would speak) |
| Imperative | -ez | **parolez!** (speak!) |

Participles:

| Type | Active | Passive |
|------|--------|---------|
| Present | -anta | -ata |
| Past | -inta | -ita |
| Future | -onta | -ota |

Examples:
- **parolanta** (speaking)
- **parolita** (having been spoken)
- **parolonta** (about to speak)

The verb “to be” is **esar**:

- **Me esas** (I am)
- **Tu esas** (You are)
- **Ilu/Elu/Olu esas** (He/She/It is)
- **Ni esas** (We are)
- **Vi esas** (You are)
- **Ili esas** (They are)

### Word Formation

Ido uses a system of affixes to create new words from existing roots:

Prefixes:
- **des-**: opposite or reversal (e.g., **faire** (to do) → **desfaire** (to undo))
- **mis-**: wrongly (e.g., **komprenar** (to understand) → **miskomprenar** (to misunderstand))
- **re-**: again (e.g., **facar** (to make) → **refacar** (to remake))

Suffixes:
- **-ero**: one who does (e.g., **bakerio** (bakery) → **bakeriero** (baker))
- **-aro**: collection (e.g., **vorto** (word) → **vortaro** (dictionary))
- **-eso**: abstract quality (e.g., **bela** (beautiful) → **beleso** (beauty))

Compound words are formed by combining roots:

- **vapor** (steam) + **navo** (ship) = **vapornavo** (steamship)
- **skrib** (write) + **tablo** (table) = **skribtablo** (desk)

## Syntax

### Basic Sentence Structure

Ido generally follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order:

**La kato chasas la muso.** (The cat chases the mouse.)

However, the word order can be flexible due to the accusative case (see below).

### Accusative Case

The accusative case is marked by -n and is used for direct objects:

**La kato chasas la muson.** (The cat chases the mouse.)

This allows for more flexible word order:

**La muson chasas la kato.** (The mouse is chased by the cat.)

The accusative is also used to indicate direction with motion verbs:

**Me iras Parizon.** (I am going to Paris.)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by placing **kad** at the beginning of a statement:

**Kad vu parolas Ido?** (Do you speak Ido?)

Information questions use interrogative words:

- **quo**: what
- **qua**: who
- **ube**: where
- **kande**: when
- **quale**: how
- **pro quo**: why

Example:
**Quo vu facas?** (What are you doing?)

### Negation

Negation is expressed using **ne** before the verb:

**Me ne komprenas.** (I don’t understand.)

### Comparison

Comparatives and superlatives are formed analytically:

- Comparative: **plu ... kam** (more ... than)
- Superlative: **maxim ... de** (most ... of)

Examples:
- **Ica libro esas plu interesanta kam ita.** (This book is more interesting than that one.)
- **Olu esas la maxim alta domo en la urbo.** (It is the tallest building in the city.)

### Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences use **se** (if) in the condition clause:

**Se pluvus, me restus heme.** (If it rained, I would stay home.)

### Passive Voice

The passive voice is formed using the verb **esar** (to be) with the passive participle:

**La libro esas skribita.** (The book is written.)

## Vocabulary

Ido vocabulary is primarily derived from Romance and Germanic languages, with a preference for internationally recognizable roots. Some examples:

| Ido | English | Origin |
|-----|---------|--------|
| **aquo** | water | Latin |
| **arboro** | tree | Latin |

## Idiomatic Expressions

Ido has developed some idiomatic expressions, often calqued from natural languages:

- **Facar la pluvo e la bela vetero** (To make the rain and the fine weather) - To be in charge, to call the shots
- **Havar mustardo pos la repasto** (To have mustard after the meal) - To be too late

- **Esar en la sama barko** (To be in the same boat) - To be in the same situation

## Differences from Esperanto

While Ido is largely based on Esperanto, it introduces several changes aimed at improving the language:

1. Alphabet: Ido eliminates Esperanto's accented letters (ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, ŭ).

2. Gender: Ido makes all nouns gender-neutral by default, with optional suffixes for specifying gender:
   - **-ulo** (male), **-ino** (female)
   - e.g., **kato** (cat), **katulo** (male cat), **katino** (female cat)

3. Accusative: The accusative -n is optional in Ido when the meaning is clear from context.

4. Articles: Ido uses **la** for “the” and has no indefinite article (Esperanto uses **la** for “the” and **unu** for “a/an”).

5. Correlatives: Ido simplifies Esperanto's correlative system:
   - Ido: **quo** (what), **qua** (who), **ube** (where), **kande** (when)
   - Esperanto: **kio** (what), **kiu** (who), **kie** (where), **kiam** (when)

6. Vocabulary: Ido often chooses more internationally recognizable roots:
   - Ido: **yuno** (young) vs. Esperanto: **juna**
   - Ido: **oldulo** (old man) vs. Esperanto: **maljunulo**

7. Word formation: Ido allows more flexibility in combining affixes and roots.

## Sample Text

Here's a sample text in Ido with an English translation:

**La Universala Deklaro di Homala Yuri**

**Artiklo 1**
**Omna homi naskas libera ed egala relate digneso e yuri. Li es dotita per raciono e koncienco e devas agar vers l'una l'altra en fratala spirito.**

**Artiklo 2**

English translation:

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights

Article 1
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

Article 2
Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

This sample demonstrates several key features of Ido, including its regular grammar, word formation principles, and internationally recognizable vocabulary.
