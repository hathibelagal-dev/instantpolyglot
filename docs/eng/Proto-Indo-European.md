# Proto-Indo-European

Proto-Indo-European (PIE) is the hypothetical common ancestor of the Indo-European language family. It was likely spoken around 4500-2500 BCE, though the exact time and location are debated. PIE is reconstructed through the comparative method, analyzing similarities between attested Indo-European languages.

## Phonology

### Consonants

PIE had a rich consonant system, including stops with a three-way distinction:

| | Labial | Dental | Palatal | Velar | Labiovelar |
|--|--------|--------|---------|-------|------------|
| Voiceless | p | t | ḱ | k | kʷ |
| Voiced | b | d | ǵ | g | gʷ |
| Voiced aspirated | bʰ | dʰ | ǵʰ | gʰ | gʷʰ |

Other consonants included:

- Fricatives: s
- Nasals: m, n
- Liquids: l, r
- Semivowels: y, w

Examples:
- **\*peh₂tēr* ('father')
- **\*bʰer-* ('to carry')
- **\*ǵʰes-* ('hand')
- **\*kʷod* ('what')

### Vowels

PIE had a simple vowel system:

| Short | Long |
|-------|------|
| e | ē |
| o | ō |
| i | ī |
| u | ū |

Additionally, PIE had three laryngeals, represented as h₁, h₂, and h₃. These sounds were lost in most daughter languages but left traces in vowel quality and quantity.

Examples:
- **\*h₂ner-* ('man')
- **\*ped-* ('foot')
- **\*suHnús* ('son')

### Ablaut

PIE featured a systematic alternation of vowels called ablaut. The most common pattern was the e/o/zero ablaut:

- e-grade: **\*bʰer-* ('to carry')
- o-grade: **\*bʰor-* ('carrier')
- zero-grade: **\*bʰr̥-* ('carried')

## Morphology

PIE was a highly inflected language with complex morphological systems for nouns, verbs, and other parts of speech.

### Nouns

Nouns in PIE were inflected for:

- Number: singular, dual, plural
- Gender: masculine, feminine, neuter
- Case: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, vocative, ablative

Example paradigm for **\*wĺ̥kʷos* ('wolf'):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **\*wĺ̥kʷos* | **\*wĺ̥kʷōs* |
| Accusative | **\*wĺ̥kʷom* | **\*wĺ̥kʷons* |
| Genitive | **\*wĺ̥kʷosyo* | **\*wĺ̥kʷōm* |
| Dative | **\*wĺ̥kʷōi* | **\*wĺ̥kʷobʰos* |
| Instrumental | **\*wĺ̥kʷoh₁* | **\*wĺ̥kʷōis* |
| Locative | **\*wĺ̥kʷoi* | **\*wĺ̥kʷoisu* |
| Vocative | **\*wĺ̥kʷe* | **\*wĺ̥kʷōs* |
| Ablative | **\*wĺ̥kʷōd* | **\*wĺ̥kʷobʰos* |

### Adjectives

Adjectives in PIE were inflected similarly to nouns, agreeing with the noun they modified in gender, number, and case.

Example: **\*newos* ('new')

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nom. Sg. | **\*newos* | **\*neweh₂* | **\*newom* |
| Acc. Sg. | **\*newom* | **\*neweh₂m* | **\*newom* |
| Gen. Sg. | **\*newosyo* | **\*neweh₂s* | **\*newosyo* |

### Pronouns

PIE had various pronoun types, including personal, demonstrative, interrogative, and relative pronouns.

Personal pronouns (1st and 2nd person):

| | Singular | Plural |
|--|----------|--------|
| 1st Nom. | **\*éǵoh₂* | **\*wéy* |
| 1st Acc. | **\*mé* | **\*nsmé* |
| 2nd Nom. | **\*túh₂* | **\*yūs* |
| 2nd Acc. | **\*twé* | **\*uswé* |

Demonstrative pronoun **\*so* ('this, that'):

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nom. Sg. | **\*so* | **\*seh₂* | **\*tod* |
| Acc. Sg. | **\*tom* | **\*teh₂m* | **\*tod* |
| Gen. Sg. | **\*tosyo* | **\*tasyeh₂s* | **\*tosyo* |

### Verbs

PIE verbs were highly complex, with inflections for:

- Person: 1st, 2nd, 3rd
- Number: singular, dual, plural
- Tense: present, aorist, perfect
- Mood: indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative
- Voice: active, middle, passive
- Aspect: imperfective, perfective, stative

Verbs also featured various stem formations and could be augmented or reduplicated.

Example paradigm for **\*bʰer-* ('to carry') in the present indicative active:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **\*bʰéroh₂* | **\*bʰéromes* |
| 2nd | **\*bʰéresi* | **\*bʰérete* |
| 3rd | **\*bʰéreti* | **\*bʰéronti* |

Aorist of **\*bʰer-*:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **\*é-bʰer-m̥* | **\*é-bʰer-me* |
| 2nd | **\*é-bʰer-s* | **\*é-bʰer-te* |
| 3rd | **\*é-bʰer-t* | **\*é-bʰer-nt* |

Perfect of **\*bʰer-*:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **\*bʰe-bʰór-h₂e* | **\*bʰe-bʰŕ̥-me* |
| 2nd | **\*bʰe-bʰór-th₂e* | **\*bʰe-bʰŕ̥-te* |
| 3rd | **\*bʰe-bʰór-e* | **\*bʰe-bʰŕ̥-r̥* |

### Participles

PIE had several participle forms:

- Present active: **\*-ont-* (e.g., **\*bʰér-ont-* 'carrying')
- Aorist active: **\*-wos-* (e.g., **\*bʰér-wos-* 'having carried')
- Perfect active: **\*-wes-* (e.g., **\*bʰe-bʰór-wes-* 'having carried')
- Passive: **\*-mh₁no-* (e.g., **\*bʰér-mh₁no-* 'being carried')

### Numerals

Cardinal numbers in PIE:

1. **\*Hóynos* ('one')
2. **\*dwóh₁* ('two')
3. **\*tréyes* ('three')
4. **\*kʷetwóres* ('four')
5. **\*pénkʷe* ('five')
6. **\*swéḱs* ('six')
7. **\*septḿ̥* ('seven')
8. **\*oḱtṓw* ('eight')
9. **\*h₁néwn̥* ('nine')
10. **\*déḱm̥* ('ten')

Ordinal numbers were formed with the suffix **\*-to-* or **\*-o-*, e.g., **\*pr̥h₂wós* ('first'), **\*dwi-tó-s* ('second'), **\*tri-tó-s* ('third').

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in PIE is believed to have been Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), though other orders were likely possible for emphasis or in specific constructions.

Example:
**\*wĺ̥kʷos owim esti* ('The wolf eats the sheep')

### Cases

The rich case system in PIE allowed for complex syntactic relationships:

- Nominative: subject of a clause
  **\*wĺ̥kʷos esti* ('The wolf is')
- Accusative: direct object
  **\*wĺ̥kʷom widn̥ti* ('They see the wolf')
- Genitive: possession, partitive
  **\*wĺ̥kʷosyo ḱerd* ('The wolf's heart')
- Dative: indirect object, recipient
  **\*wĺ̥kʷōi deh₃-* ('Give to the wolf')
- Instrumental: instrument, means
  **\*su̯ekurúh₁ h₂eǵeti* ('He drives with the axe')
- Locative: location
  **\*dom-oi h₁esti* ('He is at home')
- Vocative: direct address
  **\*wĺ̥kʷe!* ('O wolf!')
- Ablative: separation, source
  **\*gʷem-e dems-* ('He came from the house')

### Relative Clauses

PIE used relative pronouns to form relative clauses. The relative pronoun agreed with its antecedent in gender and number but took its case from its function in the relative clause.

Example:
**\*wiros yos gwem-e* ('The man who came')

### Subordinate Clauses

Various types of subordinate clauses existed in PIE:

- Conditional clauses: using particles like **\*yod* ('if')
  **\*yod gwem-e-si, wid-e-si* ('If you come, you will see')
- Purpose clauses: often using the subjunctive mood
  **\*gʷem-e-t kʷod wid-yeh₁-t* ('He came so that he might see')
- Indirect speech: using the optative mood
  **\*wekʷ-e-t kʷod gʷem-yeh₁-t* ('He said that he would come')

Compounds were formed by combining two or more stems:

- **\*kʷo-dʰh₁-o-* ('what-put' > 'what') from **\*kʷo-* ('who, what') and **\*dʰeh₁-* ('put, place')
- **\*meǵh₂-dʰh₁-o-* ('great-put' > 'great') from **\*meǵh₂-* ('great') and **\*dʰeh₁-* ('put, place')

  **\*deh₃-tor-* ('giver') from **\*deh₃-* ('give')

- Abstract nouns: **\*-ti-*
  **\*mn̥-ti-* ('thought') from **\*men-* ('think')

- Adjectives: **\*-no-*, **\*-wo-*, **\*-ro-*
  **\*new-o-* ('new') from **\*new-* ('now')

### Root Extensions

PIE roots could be extended with additional elements to create new meanings:

- **\*plew-* ('flow') > **\*plew-d-* ('float')
- **\*ster-* ('stiff') > **\*ster-k-* ('rigid')

## Semantic Fields

PIE vocabulary covered various semantic fields, including:

1. Family terms:
   **\*swesor* ('sister'), **\*bʰréh₂tēr* ('brother')

2. Body parts:
   **\*h₃ókʷs* ('eye'), **\*ǵónu* ('knee')

## Particles and Interjections

PIE had various particles and interjections that added nuance to utterances or expressed emotions:

- **\*kʷe* (and): enclitic conjunction
  Example: **\*wiros kʷe gʷeneh₂* ('man and woman')

- **\*-kʷid* (indefinite particle): added to interrogative pronouns
  Example: **\*kʷis-kʷid* ('someone, anyone')

- **\*nu* (now): temporal particle
  Example: **\*nu gʷem-* ('come now')

- **\*gʰe* (indeed, at least): emphatic particle
  Example: **\*so gʰe wiros* ('that man indeed')

- **\*h₁oh₁* (oh): exclamation of surprise or distress

## Aspect and Aktionsart

PIE verbs distinguished between different aspects and Aktionsarten (types of action):

1. Imperfective: ongoing or repeated action
   Formed by the present stem
   Example: **\*bʰér-e-ti* ('he is carrying, he carries')

2. Perfective: completed action
   Formed by the aorist stem
   Example: **\*é-bʰer-t* ('he carried')

3. Stative: state resulting from an action
   Formed by the perfect stem
   Example: **\*bʰe-bʰór-e* ('he has carried, he is in a state of having carried')

4. Iterative: repeated action
   Formed with suffix **\*-sḱe/o-*
   Example: **\*gʷm̥-sḱé-ti* ('he keeps coming')

5. Inchoative: beginning of an action
   Formed with suffix **\*-eh₁-*
   Example: **\*rúdʰ-eh₁-ti* ('it becomes red')

6. Causative: causing an action
   Formed with o-grade root and suffix **\*-éye-*
   Example: **\*sod-éye-ti* ('he makes sit')

## Nominal Formations

PIE had various ways to form nouns from roots or other stems:

1. Root nouns: formed directly from the root
   Example: **\*pōds* ('foot') from root **\*ped-*

2. Thematic nouns: formed with thematic vowel **\*-o-*/**\*-e-*
   Example: **\*wĺ̥kʷ-o-s* ('wolf')

3. Athematic nouns: formed without a thematic vowel
   Example: **\*dʰéǵʰ-ōm* ('earth')

4. Action nouns: formed with suffix **\*-ti-*
   Example: **\*mn̥-ti-s* ('thought') from **\*men-* ('to think')

5. Agent nouns: formed with suffix **\*-ter-*/**\*-tor-*
   Example: **\*deh₃-tōr* ('giver') from **\*deh₃-* ('to give')

6. Instrument nouns: formed with suffix **\*-tro-*/**\*-tlo-*
   Example: **\*h₂erh₃-tro-m* ('plow') from **\*h₂erh₃-* ('to plow')

## Adjective Formations

Adjectives in PIE were formed through various means:

1. Thematic adjectives: formed with thematic vowel **\*-o-*/**\*-eh₂-*
   Example: **\*new-o-s* ('new', m.), **\*new-eh₂* ('new', f.)

2. Comparative adjectives: formed with suffix **\*-yos-*
   Example: **\*new-yos-* ('newer')

3. Superlative adjectives: formed with suffix **\*-isto-*
   Example: **\*new-isto-* ('newest')

4. Possessive adjectives: formed with suffix **\*-yo-*
   Example: **\*ped-yo-* ('of the foot')

5. Verbal adjectives: formed with various suffixes
   Example: **\*gʷm̥-tó-* ('gone, having come') with **\*-to-* suffix

## Syntax of Noun Phrases

Noun phrases in PIE typically followed this structure:

1. (Demonstrative) + (Adjective) + Noun + (Genitive modifier)

Example: **\*so méǵh₂s wĺ̥kʷos pedōm* ('this big wolf of feet')

Adjectives agreed with the noun in gender, number, and case:

**\*méǵh₂eh₂ gʷéneh₂* ('big woman', nom. sg. f.)
**\*méǵh₂m̥ gʷenh₂m* ('big woman', acc. sg. f.)

## Verb Phrase Structure

Verb phrases in PIE could be quite complex, including various elements:

1. (Preverb) + Verb stem + Tense/Aspect marker + Mood marker + Person/Number ending

Example: **\*peri-bʰér-e-ti* ('he carries around')
- **\*peri-* : preverb meaning 'around'
- **\*bʰer-* : verb root 'carry'
- **\*-e-* : present tense marker
- **\*-ti* : 3rd person singular active ending

## Phonological Rules

PIE had various phonological rules that affected word formation and inflection:

1. Ablaut: Systematic vowel alternation
   Example: **\*sed-* (zero grade) / **\*sod-* (o-grade) / **\*sēd-* (lengthened grade)

2. Laryngeal coloring: Laryngeals affected adjacent vowels
   **\*h₁e* > **\*e*, **\*h₂e* > **\*a*, **\*h₃e* > **\*o*

3. Grassmann's law: Dissimilation of aspirates
   **\*dʰi-dʰeh₁-* > **\*di-dʰeh₁-* ('put', reduplicated present)

4. Bartholomae's law: Voicing assimilation
   **\*h₃eid-dʰi* > **\*h₃eid-dʰi* ('know!', imperative)

5. Sievers' law: Insertion of *i* after heavy syllables
   **\*med-yo-* > **\*med-iyo-* ('middle')

## Accent

PIE had a pitch accent system, though its exact nature is debated. The accent could fall on different syllables and played a role in ablaut alternations:

- **\*pə₂tḗr* ('father', nom. sg.) vs. **\*ph₂trés* (gen. sg.)
- **\*wódr̥* ('water', nom. sg.) vs. **\*udnés* (gen. sg.)

## Dialectal Variations

While PIE is reconstructed as a single language, it likely had dialectal variations. Some proposed isoglosses include:

1. Centum-Satem split: Treatment of palatovelars
   Centum: **\*ḱm̥tóm* > Latin centum
   Satem: **\*ḱm̥tóm* > Sanskrit śatám

2. Merger of **\*a* and **\*o* in some branches
   Example: PIE **\*h₂ówis* > Latin ovis, but > Sanskrit ávi-

3. Treatment of syllabic resonants
   Some dialects may have developed vowels before syllabic resonants earlier than others

## Sample Texts

Here are some reconstructed PIE sentences to illustrate the language's structure:

1. **\*h₂ówis h₁ekʷōs-kʷe*
   "The sheep and the horses"

2. **\*h₂ówis, kʷesyo wĺ̥h₁neh₂ ne h₁ést, h₁ékʷōns dedorḱe*
   "The sheep, whose wool was gone (lit. 'not was'), saw horses"

3. **\*h₁ekʷōms su̯ekurúh₁ wógʰom wégʰontm̥ h₂ner-m̥-kʷe méǵh₂m̥ bʰórom, h₂ówis-kʷe méǵh₂m̥ bʰórom wégʰontm̥*
   "One carrying a heavy wagon, one carrying a heavy load, and the sheep carrying a heavy load"

4. **\*h₂ówis h₁ekʷoibʰyós u̯ekʷét*
   "The sheep said to the horses"

5. **\*ḱḗr moi agʰnutoi h₁ékʷōns h₂eǵontm̥ h₂nerm̥ widn̥téi*
   "My heart pains me seeing a man driving horses"
