# Lower Sorbian

Lower Sorbian (dolnoserbšćina) is a West Slavic language spoken by approximately 7,000-10,000 people in the Lusatia region of eastern Germany, primarily in the state of Brandenburg. It is closely related to Upper Sorbian, with which it forms the Sorbian languages. Lower Sorbian is considered an endangered language due to its declining number of native speakers.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Lower Sorbian uses a modified Latin alphabet. The pronunciation is generally regular, with stress typically falling on the first syllable of words.

   Example: **wóz** [vos] ('wagon')

2. Palatalization: Certain consonants change before front vowels.
   Example: **noga** [nɔɡa] ('leg') → **nodze** [nɔdʑɛ] ('leg' locative)

3. The letter “w” is pronounced [w] before vowels and [f] at the end of words or before voiceless consonants.
   Example: **woda** [vɔda] ('water'), **kšyw** [kʃɨf] ('roof')

### Questions

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns at the beginning of the sentence:

**Co pišoš?** ('What are you writing?')

### Subordinate clauses
