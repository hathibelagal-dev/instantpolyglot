# Serbo-Croatian

Serbo-Croatian is a South Slavic language spoken primarily in Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro. It's often referred to by different names in different countries, such as Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, or Montenegrin, but linguistically these are considered varieties of the same language. There are about 21 million native speakers.

The language is part of the Western South Slavic dialect continuum. It developed from the Old Church Slavonic used in the medieval Serbian and Croatian states. Despite political divisions, the language remains largely mutually intelligible across its varieties.

## Writing Systems

Serbo-Croatian is unique among major world languages in that it uses two alphabets: Latin and Cyrillic. Both alphabets have been used historically, and both remain in use today, though with different prevalence in different countries.

### Latin Alphabet

The Latin alphabet is standard in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is co-official in Montenegro. It's also widely used in Serbia, especially in informal contexts.

a, b, c, č, ć, d, dž, đ, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, lj, m, n, nj, o, p, r, s, š, t, u, v, z, ž

### Cyrillic Alphabet

The Cyrillic alphabet is standard in Serbia and is co-official in Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

а, б, в, г, д, ђ, е, ж, з, и, ј, к, л, љ, м, н, њ, о, п, р, с, т, ћ, у, ф, х, ц, ч, џ, ш

Both alphabets are considered equal, and it's common for speakers to be familiar with both systems. In practice, most texts are written in only one script, not both simultaneously.

## Phonology

Serbo-Croatian has a relatively simple phonological system compared to many other Slavic languages.

### Vowels

There are five vowel phonemes:

| Vowel | IPA | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| a | [a] | open central unrounded |
| e | [e] | close-mid front unrounded |
| i | [i] | close front unrounded |
| o | [o] | close-mid back rounded |
| u | [u] | close back rounded |

Vowel length is phonemic, meaning it can distinguish between words. For example, “pas” [pas] means “dog”, while “pȃs” [pâːs] means “belt”.

### Consonants

| Consonant | IPA | Description |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| p, b | [p], [b] | bilabial plosives |
| t, d | [t], [d] | alveolar plosives |
| k, g | [k], [ɡ] | velar plosives |
| c | [ts] | alveolar affricate |
| č, dž | [tʃ], [dʒ] | postalveolar affricates |
| ć, đ | [tɕ], [dʑ] | alveolo-palatal affricates |
| f, v | [f], [ʋ] | labiodental fricatives |
| s, z | [s], [z] | alveolar fricatives |
| š, ž | [ʃ], [ʒ] | postalveolar fricatives |
| h | [x] | velar fricative |
| m | [m] | bilabial nasal |
| n | [n] | alveolar nasal |
| nj | [ɲ] | palatal nasal |
| l | [l] | alveolar lateral |
| lj | [ʎ] | palatal lateral |
| r | [r] | alveolar trill |
| j | [j] | palatal approximant |

The consonant /r/ can be syllabic, meaning it can form the nucleus of a syllable, as in the word “prst” [pr̩st] (finger).

### Stress and Pitch Accent

Serbo-Croatian has a pitch accent system, which is relatively rare among European languages. There are four types of accents:

1. Short falling: ⟨ˋ⟩
2. Short rising: ⟨ˊ⟩
3. Long falling: ⟨̂⟩
4. Long rising: ⟨˝⟩

For example:
- “grad” [ɡrâd] (city) - long falling
- “ruka” [ˈrûka] (hand) - short falling
- “noga” [ˈnòɡa] (leg) - short rising
- “glava” [ˈɡláʋa] (head) - long rising

The position of stress is not fixed and can distinguish between words. However, it always falls on the first syllable in a word with two syllables.

## Morphology

Serbo-Croatian is a highly inflected language, with complex systems for nouns, adjectives, and verbs.

### Nouns

Nouns in Serbo-Croatian have three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural), and seven cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, vocative).

Example declension for “grad” (city, masculine):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | grad | gradovi |
| Accusative | grad | gradove |
| Genitive | grada | gradova |
| Dative | gradu | gradovima |
| Instrumental | gradom | gradovima |
| Locative | gradu | gradovima |
| Vocative | grade | gradovi |

Example declension for “žena” (woman, feminine):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | žena | žene |
| Accusative | ženu | žene |
| Genitive | žene | žena |
| Dative | ženi | ženama |
| Instrumental | ženom | ženama |
| Locative | ženi | ženama |
| Vocative | ženo | žene |

Example declension for “selo” (village, neuter):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | selo | sela |
| Accusative | selo | sela |
| Genitive | sela | sela |
| Dative | selu | selima |
| Instrumental | selom | selima |
| Locative | selu | selima |
| Vocative | selo | sela |

### Adjectives

Adjectives agree with nouns in gender, number, and case. They also have definite and indefinite forms. The definite form is used when the noun is specific or previously mentioned, while the indefinite form is used for general statements.

Example: “velik” (big)

Indefinite declension (masculine singular):

| Case | Form |
|------|------|
| Nominative | velik |
| Accusative | velik / velikog |
| Genitive | velikog / velika |
| Dative | velikom / veliku |
| Instrumental | velikim |
| Locative | velikom / veliku |
| Vocative | velik |

Definite declension (masculine singular):

| Case | Form |
|------|------|
| Nominative | veliki |
| Accusative | veliki / velikog |
| Genitive | velikog |
| Dative | velikom |
| Instrumental | velikim |
| Locative | velikom |
| Vocative | veliki |

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in nominative case:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | ja | mi |
| 2nd | ti | vi |
| 3rd (m/f/n) | on / ona / ono | oni / one / ona |

Pronouns also decline for case. For example, the declension of “ja” (I):

| Case | Form |
|------|------|
| Nominative | ja |
| Accusative | mene / me |
| Genitive | mene / me |
| Dative | meni / mi |
| Instrumental | mnom |
| Locative | meni |

### Verbs

Verbs in Serbo-Croatian are conjugated for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood. The aspect system distinguishes between perfective and imperfective verbs.

Present tense of “čitati” (to read, imperfective):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | čitam | čitamo |
| 2nd | čitaš | čitate |
| 3rd | čita | čitaju |

Perfective aspect: “pročitati” (to read through)

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | pročitam | pročitamo |
| 2nd | pročitaš | pročitate |
| 3rd | pročita | pročitaju |

Future tense is formed with the auxiliary “htjeti” (will) + infinitive:
- Ja ću čitati (I will read)

Past tense uses the auxiliary “biti” (to be) + active participle:
- Ja sam čitao/čitala (I read, m/f)

Conditional mood is formed with the auxiliary “biti” in the aorist tense + active participle:
- Ja bih čitao/čitala (I would read, m/f)

Imperative mood:
- Čitaj! (Read! - singular)
- Čitajte! (Read! - plural or formal)

### Verbal Aspect

Verbal aspect is a crucial feature of Serbo-Croatian verbs. Most verbs come in aspectual pairs:

- Imperfective: describes ongoing, repeated, or habitual actions
- Perfective: describes completed actions or actions viewed as a whole

For example:
- “pisati” (to write, imperfective) / “napisati” (to write, perfective)
- “čitati” (to read, imperfective) / “pročitati” (to read, perfective)

The aspect can change the meaning of a sentence:
- “Čitao sam knjigu” (I was reading a book - emphasis on the process)
- “Pročitao sam knjigu” (I read/finished the book - emphasis on completion)

### Numbers

Cardinal numbers:
1 - jedan/jedna/jedno, 2 - dva/dvije, 3 - tri, 4 - četiri, 5 - pet, 6 - šest, 7 - sedam, 8 - osam, 9 - devet, 10 - deset

Numbers decline for case when used with nouns. The numbers 1-4 have special forms:

- “jedan čovjek” (one man, nom.)
- “jednog čovjeka” (one man, acc./gen.)
- “dva čovjeka” (two men)
- “tri čovjeka” (three men)
- “četiri čovjeka” (four men)
- “pet ljudi” (five people)

Note that for 5 and above, the noun takes the genitive plural form.

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding adjectival endings to the cardinal numbers:
prvi (first), drugi (second), treći (third), četvrti (fourth), peti (fifth), etc.

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Serbo-Croatian is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), but it's relatively flexible due to the case system. For example:

- Ana čita knjigu. (Ana reads a book.)
- Knjigu čita Ana. (It's Ana who reads the book.)
- Čita Ana knjigu. (Ana is reading a book.)

All these sentences are grammatically correct and mean essentially the same thing, with slight differences in emphasis.

### Questions

Questions can be formed in several ways:

1. By intonation:
   - Ti govoriš hrvatski? (You speak Croatian?)

2. Using the particle “li”:
   - Govoriš li hrvatski? (Do you speak Croatian?)

3. Using question words:
   - Što čitaš? (What are you reading?)
   - Gdje ideš? (Where are you going?)

### Negation

Negation is formed by placing “ne” before the verb:
- Ne govorim hrvatski. (I don’t speak Croatian.)

In the case of the verb “biti” (to be) in the present tense, “ne” combines with the verb:
- Nisam sretan. (I'm not happy.)

Double negatives are standard in Serbo-Croatian:
- Nitko nije došao. (Nobody came. Literally: “Nobody didn't come.”)

### Articles

There are no articles in Serbo-Croatian. Definiteness can be expressed through:

1. Word order: Known information tends to come earlier in the sentence.
2. Demonstratives: “ovaj” (this), “taj” (that), “onaj” (that over there)
3. Context
4. Definite/indefinite forms of adjectives

### Participles

Serbo-Croatian has several types of participles:

1. Present active participle: formed from imperfective verbs, e.g., “čitajući” (reading)
2. Past active participle: used to form past tense, e.g., “čitao” (read)
3. Passive participle: used to form passive voice, e.g., “čitan” (read/being read)

### Passive Voice

Passive voice is formed using the verb “biti” (to be) + passive participle:
- Knjiga je čitana. (The book is/was being read.)

### Reflexive Verbs

Many verbs in Serbo-Croatian are reflexive, using the reflexive pronoun “se”:
- Zovem se Ivan. (My name is Ivan. Literally: “I call myself Ivan.”)

## Vocabulary

Serbo-Croatian vocabulary is primarily Slavic in origin, with loanwords from various languages due to historical and cultural influences:

1. Turkish: due to Ottoman influence
   Examples: 
   - “šećer” (sugar)
   - “čarapa” (sock)
   - “rakija” (fruit brandy)

2. German: especially in technical and everyday terms
   Examples:
   - “šrafciger” (screwdriver)
   - “paradajz” (tomato)
   - “šnajder” (tailor)

3. Italian: particularly in coastal areas
   Examples:
   - “pjaca” (square, from Italian “piazza”)
   - “špageti” (spaghetti)
   - “barka” (boat)

4. Hungarian: due to historical connections
   Examples:
   - “cipela” (shoe)
   - “soba” (room)
   - “lopov” (thief)

5. English: modern loanwords, especially in technology and pop culture
   Examples:
   - “kompjuter” (computer)
   - “menadžer” (manager)
   - “vikend” (weekend)

6. French: mostly in cuisine and fashion
   Examples:
   - “restoran” (restaurant)
   - “garderoba” (wardrobe)
   - “dekolte” (décolletage)

Many words vary between the standard varieties. For example:

| Meaning | Croatian | Serbian |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Bread | kruh | hleb |
| Train | vlak | voz |
| Football | nogomet | fudbal |

However, speakers generally understand all variants.

## Dialects

There are three main dialect groups in Serbo-Croatian:

1. Štokavian: The basis for all standard varieties of Serbo-Croatian. It's spoken in most of Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and parts of Croatia.

2. Kajkavian: Spoken in north-western Croatia, including Zagreb. It shares some features with Slovene.

3. Čakavian: Spoken along the Adriatic coast in Croatia and some islands.

These dialects are named after their word for “what”: što, kaj, and ča respectively.

The standard languages are based on the Štokavian dialect, but there are further subdivisions based on the reflex of the Common Slavic vowel yat:

- Ekavian: mainly used in Serbia
  Example: “mleko” (milk)

- Ijekavian: used in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro
  Example: “mlijeko” (milk)

- Ikavian: used in some dialects, particularly in parts of Dalmatia and western Herzegovina
  Example: “mliko” (milk)

Despite these differences, mutual intelligibility remains high across all varieties.

## Usage Notes

### Formal and Informal Address

Serbo-Croatian, like many European languages, distinguishes between formal and informal forms of address:

- “ti” is the informal singular “you”
- “vi” is both the formal singular “you” and the plural “you” (both formal and informal)

Using “ti” vs “Vi” (capitalized in writing when used as the formal singular) is important in social interactions. “Vi” is used:
- With older people
- In formal situations
- With people you don’t know well
- To show respect

For example:
- “Kako si?” (How are you? - informal)
- “Kako ste?” (How are you? - formal or plural)

### Politeness and Etiquette

Politeness in Serbo-Croatian is often expressed through the use of the conditional mood:
- “Htio bih...” (I would like...) is more polite than “Hoću...” (I want...)

The word “molim” (please) is often used, both as a request and as a response to “hvala” (thank you).

### Idiomatic Expressions

Serbo-Croatian has many idiomatic expressions. Here are a few examples:

- “Pada mi mrak na oči” (Darkness is falling on my eyes) - I'm getting very angry
- “Bacati pare kroz prozor” (To throw money through the window) - To waste money
- “Prodavati maglu” (To sell fog) - To deceive or make empty promises

### Regional Variations

While the language is largely the same across countries, there are some regional preferences in vocabulary and expression. For example:

- In Croatia, “doviđenja” is commonly used for “goodbye”, while in Serbia “doviđenja” or “prijatno” are more common.
- The phrase “Kako si?” (How are you?) is more common in informal situations in Croatia, while “Šta ima?” (What's up?) is more common in Serbia.

## Writing System and Orthography

### Alphabet Order

The alphabetical order in Serbo-Croatian dictionaries differs slightly from English:

Latin: A B C Č Ć D Dž Đ E F G H I J K L Lj M N Nj O P R S Š T U V Z Ž

Cyrillic: А Б В Г Д Ђ Е Ж З И Ј К Л Љ М Н Њ О П Р С Т Ћ У Ф Х Ц Ч Џ Ш

Note that digraphs like “lj”, “nj”, and “dž” are treated as single letters.

### Capitalization Rules

Capitalization rules in Serbo-Croatian are similar to English, with a few notable differences:

- Names of months and days of the week are not capitalized: “januar” (January), “ponedeljak” (Monday)
- Names of languages and nationalities are not capitalized: “srpski” (Serbian), “hrvat” (Croat)
- In titles, only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized

### Punctuation

Punctuation in Serbo-Croatian is generally similar to English, with a few differences:

- Quotation marks: „quote“ or »quote« (note the position of the marks)

## Grammar Peculiarities

### Clitic Pronouns

Serbo-Croatian uses clitic (unstressed) forms of pronouns, which have strict rules about their position in a sentence. They usually come after the first stressed word or phrase:

- Dao sam ti knjigu. (I gave you the book.)
- Knjigu sam ti dao. (The book, I gave you.)

### Aspect Pairs in Verbs

As mentioned earlier, most verbs come in aspect pairs. Learning to use these correctly is crucial for mastering Serbo-Croatian:

- ”Pisati“ (to write, imperfective) / ”napisati“ (to write, perfective)
- ”Učiti“ (to learn/study, imperfective) / ”naučiti“ (to learn, perfective)

The choice between imperfective and perfective can change the meaning of a sentence:

- ”Učio sam cijeli dan.“ (I was studying all day.)
- ”Naučio sam lekciju.“ (I learned the lesson.)

### The Vocative Case

The vocative case, used for direct address, is becoming less common in everyday speech, especially in Serbia, but is still used in formal or emphatic situations:

- Ivane! (addressing a man named Ivan)
- Marijo! (addressing a woman named Marija)

### Impersonal Constructions

Serbo-Croatian often uses impersonal constructions where English might use a personal subject:

- ”Hladno mi je.“ (I'm cold. Literally: ”It is cold to me.“)
- ”Spava mi se.“ (I feel sleepy. Literally: ”It sleeps itself to me.“)

### Verbal Adverbs

Serbo-Croatian has verbal adverbs that don’t exist in English:

- Present verbal adverb: ”Trčeći je pao.“ (He fell while running.)
- Past verbal adverb: ”Završivši posao, otišao je kući.“ (Having finished work, he went home.)
