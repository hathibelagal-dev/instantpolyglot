# Northeast Asia Linguistic Area

The Northeast Asia Linguistic Area, also known as the Siberian or Northern Asian Sprachbund, is a proposed linguistic area encompassing languages spoken in northeastern Asia, including parts of Siberia, Mongolia, northern China, and the Korean Peninsula. This region is characterized by a diverse array of language families that have developed certain shared features through prolonged contact and mutual influence, despite their different genetic origins.

## Language Families and Major Languages

The Northeast Asia Linguistic Area includes languages from several distinct families:

1. Tungusic
   - Evenki
   - Manchu
   - Nanai

2. Mongolic
   - Mongolian (Khalkha)
   - Buryat
   - Kalmyk

3. Turkic
   - Yakut (Sakha)
   - Tuvan
   - Altai

4. Uralic (Finno-Ugric branch)
   - Khanty
   - Mansi
   - Nenets

5. Yeniseian
   - Ket

6. Yukaghir
   - Northern Yukaghir (Tundra)

While not all of these languages share all features associated with the area, they exhibit varying degrees of similarity in phonology, morphology, and syntax that suggest long-term areal convergence.

## Phonological Features

### Vowel Harmony

One of the most prominent features of the Northeast Asian Linguistic Area is vowel harmony, a system where vowels in a word must belong to the same class, typically based on features like frontness or backness. This feature is particularly strong in Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages.

Examples:

1. Mongolian (Khalkha):
   - Front harmony: **үсэг** [usəg] "letter"
   - Back harmony: **уншах** [unʃəx] "to read"

2. Yakut (Sakha):
   - Front harmony: **күн** [kyn] "day"
   - Back harmony: **оҕо** [oɣo] "child"

3. Evenki:
   - Front harmony: **эмэ-** [eme-] "to come"
   - Back harmony: **ама-** [ama-] "to sleep"

### Lack of Phonemic Voicing Contrast

Many languages in the area lack a phonemic voicing contrast for stops and fricatives, instead distinguishing between aspirated and unaspirated consonants.

Examples:

1. Korean:
   - Aspirated: **편** [pʰjən] "side"
   - Unaspirated: **벽** [pjək̚] "wall"

2. Mongolian:
   - Aspirated: **хаалга** [xaːɮəɢ] "door"
   - Unaspirated: **гар** [ɢar] "hand"

### Limited Consonant Clusters

Languages in this area often have restrictions on consonant clusters, particularly at the beginning of words.

Examples:

1. Japanese: 
   - **くつ** [kut͡su] "shoe" (no initial clusters)

2. Korean:
   - **학교** [hak̚k͈jo] "school" (clusters only across syllable boundaries)

3. Mongolian:
   - **хөгжим** [xөɡd͡ʒim] "music" (limited medial clusters)

## Morphological Features

### Agglutination

Most languages in the Northeast Asian Linguistic Area are highly agglutinative, meaning grammatical information is expressed through the addition of multiple affixes to a root word.

Examples:

1. Turkish (for comparison):
   - **ev-ler-im-de-ki-ler** 
     house-PL-1SG.POSS-LOC-REL-PL
     "those (things) in my houses"

2. Mongolian:
   - **үзэ-гд-үүл-э-х**
     see-PASS-CAUS-CONN-INF
     "to be made visible"

3. Korean:
   - **가-시-었-겠-습니다**
     go-HON-PST-PROB-POL.DECL
     "(Someone honorific) probably went"

### Case Systems

## Influence of Chinese

Due to the historical and cultural influence of China in the region, many languages in the Northeast Asian Linguistic Area have borrowed extensively from Chinese at various periods. This influence is particularly evident in vocabulary, but hasalso affected other aspects of these languages. Here are some examples of Chinese influence in the Northeast Asian Linguistic Area:

### Sino-Xenic Vocabularies

Many languages in the area have a significant stratum of vocabulary borrowed from Chinese, often referred to as Sino-Xenic vocabularies. These loanwords are typically used in formal or academic contexts and coexist with native vocabulary.

Examples:

1. Japanese:
   - Native: **水** [mizu] "water"
   - Sino-Japanese: **水分** [suibun] "moisture" (水 "water" + 分 "part")

2. Korean:
   - Native: **물** [mul] "water"
   - Sino-Korean: **수분** [subun] "moisture" (水 "water" + 分 "part")

3. Vietnamese (for comparison, though not strictly part of the Northeast Asian Linguistic Area):
   - Native: **nước** "water"
   - Sino-Vietnamese: **thủy** "water" (as in compounds)

### Numeral Systems

Many languages in the area have adopted or been influenced by the Chinese numeral system, often resulting in the coexistence of native and Sino-Xenic numeral systems.

Examples:

1. Japanese:
   - Native: **ひとつ、ふたつ、みっつ** [hitotsu, futatsu, mittsu] "one, two, three"
   - Sino-Japanese: **一、二、三** [ichi, ni, san] "one, two, three"

2. Korean:
   - Native: **하나、둘、셋** [hana, dul, set̚] "one, two, three"
   - Sino-Korean: **일、이、삼** [il, i, sam] "one, two, three"

3. Vietnamese (for comparison):
   - Native: **một, hai, ba** "one, two, three"
   - Sino-Vietnamese: **nhất, nhị, tam** "one, two, three" (in certain contexts)

### Four-Character Idioms

Many languages in the area have adopted the Chinese tradition of four-character idioms (成語 chéngyǔ in Mandarin), which are concise, often literary expressions usually consisting of four characters.

Examples:

1. Japanese:
   **一石二鳥** [isseki nichō] "killing two birds with one stone"
   (lit. "one stone, two birds")

2. Korean:
   **일석이조** [ilsʰək̚it͡ɕo] "killing two birds with one stone"
   (lit. "one stone, two birds")

3. Vietnamese (for comparison):
   **nhất cử lưỡng tiện** "killing two birds with one stone"
   (lit. "one action, two conveniences")

### Structural Borrowing

In some cases, Chinese has influenced the structure of languages in the area, particularly in the formation of compound words and in certain syntactic patterns.

Examples:

1. Japanese compound formation:
   **図書館** [toshokan] "library"
   (図 "diagram" + 書 "book" + 館 "building")

2. Korean compound formation:
   **도서관** [tosʰəɡwan] "library"
   (圖 "diagram" + 書 "book" + 館 "building")

3. Manchu (historically):
   The syntax of Written Manchu was heavily influenced by Classical Chinese, leading to structures that were not typical of spoken Manchu or other Tungusic languages.

## Areal Features in Phonology

### Pitch Accent

Several languages in the area have developed pitch accent systems, which are distinct from the tonal systems of Chinese languages but may have been influenced by them.

Examples:

1. Japanese:
   **箸** [haʃi˥] "chopsticks" vs. **橋** [haʃi˥˩] "bridge"

2. Korean (Seoul dialect):
   While standard Korean is often described as having lost its historical pitch accent, some dialects, like Gyeongsang, retain a pitch accent system:
   **말** [mal˥] "horse" vs. **말** [mal˩] "speech"

3. Ainu:
   **cise** [t͡ɕise˥] "house" vs. **sine** [sine˩] "one"

### Vowel Length Distinction

Many languages in the area distinguish between short and long vowels.

Examples:

1. Japanese:
   **おばさん** [obasan] "aunt" vs. **おばあさん** [obaːsan] "grandmother"

2. Korean:
   **눈** [nun] "eye" vs. **눈** [nuːn] "snow"

3. Mongolian:
   **ор** [or] "enter" vs. **оор** [oːr] "different"

### Lack of Consonant Clusters

As mentioned earlier, many languages in the area have restrictions on consonant clusters, particularly at the beginning of words. This feature is shared across several language families in the region.

Examples:

1. Japanese:
   Loanwords with initial clusters are adapted: "cream" → **クリーム** [kuriːmu]

2. Korean:
   Loanwords with initial clusters are adapted: "spring" → **스프링** [sɯpʰɯɾiŋ]

3. Mongolian:
   Native words rarely have initial clusters: **хэл** [xeɮ] "language"

## Areal Features in Morphosyntax

### Sentence-Final Particles

Many languages in the area use sentence-final particles to express mood, emotion, or speaker attitude.

Examples:

1. Japanese:
   **雨が降るよ。** [ame ɡa furu jo]
   rain-NOM fall-NPST SFP
   "It's going to rain." (informing)

2. Korean:
   **비가 올 거야.** [piɡa ol kəja]
   rain-NOM come-FUT SFP
   "It's going to rain." (casual assertion)

3. Mongolian:
   **Бороо орох байх даа.** [borɔː orox baix daː]
   rain fall-INF be-INF SFP
   "It's probably going to rain." (speaker's assumption)

### Extensive Use of Aspect

Many languages in the area have developed complex aspectual systems, often grammaticalizing distinctions that are lexical in other languages.

Examples:

1. Japanese:
   - Resultative: **食べてある** [tabete aru] "have eaten" (resulting state)
   - Progressive: **食べている** [tabete iru] "is eating"
   - Perfective: **食べてしまう** [tabete ʃimau] "eat up completely"

2. Korean:
   - Resultative: **먹어 있다** [məɡə itta] "have eaten" (resulting state)
   - Progressive: **먹고 있다** [məkko itta] "is eating"
   - Perfective: **먹어 버리다** [məɡə bərida] "eat up completely"

3. Mongolian:
   - Resultative: **идчихсэн байна** [idtʃixsen baina] "have eaten" (resulting state)
   - Progressive: **идэж байна** [idəd͡ʒ baina] "is eating"
   - Perfective: **идчихэх** [idtʃixex] "eat up completely"

### Evidentiality

Some languages in the area have developed evidential systems, marking the source of information in the utterance.

Examples:

1. Mongolian:
   - Direct evidence: **Бороо орж байна.** [borɔː ord͡ʒ baina]
     "It's raining." (speaker sees it)
   - Indirect evidence: **Бороо орж байна гэнэ.** [borɔː ord͡ʒ baina ɡene]
     "It's raining, they say." (speaker heard from someone else)

2. Korean (to some extent):
   - Direct evidence: **비가 오네요.** [piɡa onejo]
     "It's raining." (speaker notices it)
   - Reportative: **비가 온대요.** [piɡa ondɛjo]
     "They say it's raining." (speaker heard from someone else)

3. Japanese (not a full evidential system, but has some evidential-like expressions):
   - **雨が降っているようだ。** [ame ɡa futte iru joːda]
     "It seems to be raining." (based on indirect evidence)
   - **雨が降っているらしい。** [ame ɡa futte iru raʃiː]
     "I hear it's raining." (based on hearsay)

## Conclusion

The Northeast Asia Linguistic Area showcases how languages from different families can converge in their features due to long-term contact and mutual influence. While not all languages in the area share all of these features, and the degree of similarity varies, the overall pattern of shared characteristics is striking. This areal convergence has resulted in a fascinating linguistic landscape where genealogically unrelated languages show remarkable similarities in structure and expression, while still maintaining their unique identities.

It's important to note that the concept of a linguistic area is a matter of degree rather than a clear-cut classification. Some languages in the Northeast Asia Linguistic Area show more areal features than others, and the boundaries of the area are not sharply defined. Furthermore, ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of the relationships and influences among these languages.

The study of this linguistic area not only provides insights into the historical interactions of the peoples in this region but also contributes to our broader understanding of language contact phenomena and the ways in which languages can influence each other over time.
