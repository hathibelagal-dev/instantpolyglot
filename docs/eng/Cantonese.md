# Cantonese

Cantonese (廣東話, **gwong2 dung1 waa2**) is a Sinitic language spoken by about 85 million people, primarily in southeastern China, Hong Kong, and Macau. It is also widely spoken in overseas Chinese communities. Cantonese belongs to the Yue branch of Chinese languages and is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin or other Chinese varieties.

## Phonology

### Tones

Cantonese is a tonal language with six phonemic tones in open syllables and three tones in checked syllables (those ending in p, t, or k). The tones are typically numbered from 1 to 6:

2. High rising: 25 (ˊ)
3. Mid level: 33 (`)
4. Low falling: 21 (ˋ)
5. Low rising: 23 (ˇ)

Example sentence in different systems:

Traditional characters: 我喺香港住。
Jyutping: ngo5 hai2 hoeng1 gong2 zyu6.
Yale: ngóh hái hēung góng jyuh.
English: "I live in Hong Kong."

Some characters are specific to written Cantonese and are not used in Standard Written Chinese:

- **佢** (keoi5) "he/she/it"
- **嚟** (lai4) "to come"
- **喺** (hai2) "to be at"
- **唔** (m4) "not"

## Grammar

### Word order

Cantonese, like Mandarin, is an SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) language.

Example:
**我食飯。** (ngo5 sik6 faan6)
"I eat rice."

### Nouns

Cantonese nouns do not inflect for number or case. Plurality can be expressed using classifiers or numbers.

Example:
**一隻狗** (jat1 zek3 gau2) "one dog"
**三隻狗** (saam1 zek3 gau2) "three dogs"

### Classifiers

Classifiers are used with nouns when counting or specifying quantities. Different nouns use different classifiers based on their shape, function, or other characteristics.

Common classifiers:
- **個** (go3): general classifier
- **隻** (zek3): for animals, one of a pair
- **本** (bun2): for books
- **張** (zoeng1): for flat objects

Examples:
**一個人** (jat1 go3 jan4) "one person"
**三隻貓** (saam1 zek3 maau1) "three cats"
**五本書** (ng5 bun2 syu1) "five books"

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Cantonese:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **我** (ngo5) | **我哋** (ngo5 dei6) |
| 2nd | **你** (nei5) | **你哋** (nei5 dei6) |
| 3rd | **佢** (keoi5) | **佢哋** (keoi5 dei6) |

Possessive pronouns are formed by adding the particle **嘅** (ge3) to personal pronouns:

**我嘅書** (ngo5 ge3 syu1) "my book"
**佢嘅朋友** (keoi5 ge3 pang4 jau5) "his/her friend"

### Verbs

Cantonese verbs do not conjugate for person, number, or tense. Tense and aspect are expressed through context or particles.

#### Aspect particles

- **緊** (gan2): progressive aspect
- **咗** (zo2): perfective aspect
- **過** (gwo3): experiential aspect

Examples:
**我食緊飯。** (ngo5 sik6 gan2 faan6) "I am eating."
**我食咗飯。** (ngo5 sik6 zo2 faan6) "I have eaten."
**我食過飯。** (ngo5 sik6 gwo3 faan6) "I have eaten before."

#### Serial verb constructions

Cantonese uses serial verb constructions, where two or more verbs are used in sequence without conjunctions.

Example:
**我去買嘢食。** (ngo5 heoi3 maai5 je5 sik6)
"I go buy things to eat." (I'm going shopping for food.)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Cantonese can function as both attributive (before nouns) and predicative (after the copula 係 hai6).

Attributive: **大隻狗** (daai6 zek3 gau2) "big dog"
Predicative: **隻狗係大隻嘅。** (zek3 gau2 hai6 daai6 zek3 ge3) "The dog is big."

Comparatives are formed using the particle **過** (gwo3):
**佢高過我。** (keoi5 gou1 gwo3 ngo5) "He is taller than me."

Superlatives use the adverb **最** (zeoi3):
**佢最高。** (keoi5 zeoi3 gou1) "He is the tallest."

### Negation

The main negation particle in Cantonese is **唔** (m4), used before verbs and adjectives:

**我唔食魚。** (ngo5 m4 sik6 jyu4) "I don't eat fish."
**佢唔高。** (keoi5 m4 gou1) "He is not tall."

For the verb "to have" (有 jau5), the negation particle is **冇** (mou5):

**我冇錢。** (ngo5 mou5 cin2) "I don't have money."

### Questions

Yes/no questions can be formed by adding the particle **咩** (me1) at the end of a statement:

**你食咗飯咩？** (nei5 sik6 zo2 faan6 me1) "Have you eaten?"

Alternatively, A-not-A questions can be used:

**你食唔食飯？** (nei5 sik6 m4 sik6 faan6) "Do you eat or not?"

Wh-questions use question words in situ:

**你叫咩名？** (nei5 giu3 me1 meng2) "What's your name?"
**你幾點返工？** (nei5 gei2 dim2 faan1 gung1) "What time do you go to work?"

### Sentence-final particles

Cantonese has a rich system of sentence-final particles that convey various pragmatic and emotional meanings:

- **啊** (aa3): softens statements
- **喎** (wo3): indicates surprise or realization
- **呢** (ne1): asks for confirmation or continues a topic
- **咧** (le1): emphasizes a current state
- **咩** (me1): expresses doubt or forms questions

Examples:
**我好攰啊。** (ngo5 hou2 gui6 aa3) "I'm very tired."
**原來係咁喎。** (jyun4 loi4 hai6 gam3 wo3) "Oh, so that's how it is."
**你叫咩名呢？** (nei5 giu3 me1 meng2 ne1) "What's your name?"
**佢返咗屋企咧。** (keoi5 faan1 zo2 uk1 kei2 le1) "He has gone home."

## Colloquial Cantonese

Colloquial Cantonese differs significantly from written Chinese and formal Cantonese. Some features of colloquial Cantonese include:

**咁樣** (gam3 joeng2) → **噉** (gam2) "like this"

## Variations

  **Shopping** (so2 ping4) "to go shopping" (younger)

- Education level can influence the use of literary vs. colloquial forms:
