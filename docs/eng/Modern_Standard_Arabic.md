# Modern Standard Arabic

Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), known in Arabic as **اللغة العربية الفصحى الحديثة** (al-lughah al-ʻArabīyah al-fuṣḥā al-ḥadīthah), is the standardized and literary variety of Arabic used in writing and formal speech throughout the Arab world. It is based on Classical Arabic and is the language of literature, media, education, and formal communication.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Arabic has 28 consonant phonemes:

| Manner of Articulation | Labial | Dental/Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Pharyngeal | Glottal |
|------------------------|--------|-----------------|---------|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| Plosive | b ب | t ت d د | | k ك | q ق | | ʔ ء |
| Emphatic Plosive | | ṭ ط ḍ ض | | | | | |
| Fricative | f ف | s س z ز | š ش | x خ | ɣ غ | ħ ح ʕ ع | h ه |
| Emphatic Fricative | | ṣ ص ẓ ظ | | | | | |
| Nasal | m م | n ن | | | | | |
| Lateral | | l ل | | | | | |
| Trill | | r ر | | | | | |
| Approximant | w و | | j ي | | | | |

### Vowels

MSA has three short vowels and three long vowels:

Short vowels:
- /a/ (fatḥah) - َ
- /i/ (kasrah) - ِ
- /u/ (ḍammah) - ُ

Long vowels:
- /aː/ (ʾalif) - ا
- /iː/ (yāʾ) - ي
- /uː/ (wāw) - و

Additionally, there are two diphthongs:
- /aj/ (fatḥah followed by yāʾ) - َي
- /aw/ (fatḥah followed by wāw) - َو

### Stress

Stress in MSA is predictable and follows these general rules:

1. Stress the last syllable if it's superheavy (CVVC or CVCC).
2. Otherwise, stress the penultimate syllable if it's heavy (CVV or CVC).
3. Otherwise, stress the antepenultimate syllable.

Examples:
- ki**tāb** (book) - stress on the last syllable
- **mad**-ra-sah (school) - stress on the first syllable
- mu-**dar**-ris (teacher) - stress on the second syllable

## Writing System

Arabic uses an abjad writing system, written from right to left. The alphabet consists of 28 consonant letters:

ا ب ت ث ج ح خ د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ك ل م ن ه و ي

Most letters have four forms: isolated, initial, medial, and final. For example, the letter “ب” (b):
- Isolated: ب
- Initial: بـ
- Medial: ـبـ
- Final: ـب

Short vowels are typically not written in everyday text but are represented by diacritical marks in educational materials, religious texts, and poetry:
- Fatḥah (a): َ
- Kasrah (i): ِ
- Ḍammah (u): ُ

Additional diacritical marks include:
- Sukūn (absence of vowel): ْ
- Šaddah (consonant gemination): ّ
- Tanwīn (nunation): ً ٍ ٌ

## Morphology

Arabic morphology is based on a root-and-pattern system. Most words are derived from a three-consonant root, with vowels and additional consonants added to create different words and grammatical forms.

### Nouns

Nouns in Arabic have three cases (nominative, accusative, genitive), two genders (masculine and feminine), three numbers (singular, dual, plural), and two states (definite and indefinite).

Case endings:
- Nominative: -u (ُ)
- Accusative: -a (َ)
- Genitive: -i (ِ)

Example: **kitāb** (book)
- Nominative: **kitāb-u**
- Accusative: **kitāb-a**
- Genitive: **kitāb-i**

Gender:
- Masculine: unmarked
- Feminine: typically marked with tāʾ marbūṭah (ة)

Example:
- **mudarris** (male teacher)
- **mudarris-ah** (female teacher)

Number:
- Singular: unmarked
- Dual: suffix -āni (nominative) or -ayni (accusative/genitive)
- Plural: various patterns, including “sound” and “broken” plurals

Example:
- Singular: **kitāb** (book)
- Dual: **kitāb-āni** (two books, nominative)
- Plural: **kutub** (books)

Definiteness:
- Definite: marked with the prefix **al-** (ال)
- Indefinite: unmarked, with nunation (tanwīn) in formal Arabic

Example:
- Indefinite: **kitāb-un** (a book, nominative)
- Definite: **al-kitāb-u** (the book, nominative)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **ʾanā** أنا | - | **naḥnu** نحن |
| 2nd masc. | **ʾanta** أنتَ | **ʾantumā** أنتما | **ʾantum** أنتم |

| 3rd masc. | **huwa** هو | **humā** هما | **hum** هم |
| 3rd fem. | **hiya** هي | **humā** هما | **hunna** هن |

Possessive pronouns are suffixed to nouns:

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | -ī ـي | - | -nā ـنا |
| 2nd masc. | -ka ـكَ | -kumā ـكما | -kum ـكم |

### Verbs

Arabic verbs are based on a root system, typically consisting of three consonants. Various patterns are applied to these roots to create different verb forms and derivations.

Basic verb conjugation (past tense) for the root k-t-b (write):

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **katabtu** كتبتُ | - | **katabnā** كتبنا |
| 2nd masc. | **katabta** كتبتَ | **katabtumā** كتبتما | **katabtum** كتبتم |
| 2nd fem. | **katabti** كتبتِ | **katabtumā** كتبتما | **katabtunna** كتبتن |
| 3rd masc. | **kataba** كتب | **katabā** كتبا | **katabū** كتبوا |
| 3rd fem. | **katabat** كتبت | **katabatā** كتبتا | **katabna** كتبن |

Present tense conjugation:

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **ʾaktubu** أكتبُ | - | **naktubu** نكتبُ |

| 3rd fem. | **taktubu** تكتبُ | **taktubāni** تكتبان | **yaktubna** يكتبن |

Verb forms:
Arabic has ten main verb forms (I-X), each with its own pattern and general meaning:

I. Basic form: **kataba** (he wrote)
II. Intensive/causative: **kattaba** (he made write)
III. Reciprocal: **kātaba** (he corresponded with)
IV. Causative: **ʾaktaba** (he dictated)
V. Reflexive of II: **takattaba** (it was written)
VI. Reciprocal of III: **takātaba** (they wrote to each other)
VII. Passive: **inkataba** (it was written)
VIII. Reflexive: **iktataba** (he wrote (for himself))
IX. Colors and defects: **iḥmarra** (it became red)
X. Requestative: **istaktaba** (he asked (someone) to write)

### Participles

Arabic has active and passive participles:

- Active participle: **kātib** (writing, writer)
- Passive participle: **maktūb** (written)

### Verbal Nouns (Maṣdar)

Each verb has an associated verbal noun, which can vary in form:

- Form I: **kitābah** (writing)
- Form II: **taktīb** (causing to write)
- Form III: **mukātabah** (correspondence)

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Arabic is Verb-Subject-Object (VSO), although Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) is also common, especially in modern usage.

VSO example:
**kataba l-waladu r-risālata**
wrote the-boy the-letter
“The boy wrote the letter.”

SVO example:
**al-waladu kataba r-risālata**
the-boy wrote the-letter
“The boy wrote the letter.”

### Agreement

Verbs agree with their subjects in person, number, and gender. However, when the subject follows the verb, the verb is always in the singular form:

- **al-ʾawlādu katab-ū d-darsa** (The boys wrote the lesson)
- **kataba l-ʾawlādu d-darsa** (The boys wrote the lesson)

Adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, case, and definiteness:

- **al-kitābu l-kabīru** (the big book)
- **al-kutubu l-kabīratu** (the big books)

### Construct State (ʾIḍāfah)

The construct state is used to express possession and compound nouns. The first noun (possessor) is indefinite and not marked for case, while the second noun (possessed) is in the genitive case:

**kitābu l-waladi**
book the-boy-GEN
“the boy's book”

### Negation

Negation is expressed differently depending on the tense and mood:

- Past tense: **lam** + jussive
  **lam yaktub** (he did not write)

- Present tense: **lā** + indicative
  **lā yaktubu** (he does not write)

- Future tense: **lan** + subjunctive
  **lan yaktuba** (he will not write)

- Nominal sentences: **laysa**
  **laysa l-waladu kabīran** (The boy is not big)

### Conditional Sentences

Arabic has two main types of conditional sentences:

1. Real condition (likely or possible):
   **ʾin tadrus tanjaḥ**
   if you-study you-succeed
   “If you study, you will succeed.”

2. Unreal condition (unlikely or impossible):
   **law darasta la-najaḥta**
   if you-had-studied you-would-have-succeeded
   “If you had studied, you would have succeeded.”

## Dialects and Diglossia

While Modern Standard Arabic is the official language of the Arab world, it is primarily used in formal contexts. In everyday life, people speak various Arabic dialects, which can differ significantly from MSA and from each other. This situation is known as diglossia.

Major dialect groups include:
1. Maghrebi (North African)
2. Egyptian
3. Levantine
4. Gulf
5. Iraqi

Examples of dialectal differences:

MSA: **kayfa ḥāluka?** (How are you? - masculine)
Egyptian: **ʾizzayak?**
Levantine: **kīfak?**
Gulf: **šlōnak?**

MSA: **ʾurīdu ʾan ʾaḏhaba** (I want to go)
Egyptian: **ʿāyiz ʾarūḥ**
Levantine: **biddi rūḥ**
Gulf: **ʾabī ʾarūḥ**

## Colloquial Features

While MSA is the standard form, colloquial Arabic has some distinctive features:

1. Simplification of case endings:
   MSA: **al-kitābu l-kabīru** (the big book)
   Colloquial: **il-kitāb il-kibīr**

2. Changes in pronunciation:
   MSA: **qalb** (heart)
   Egyptian: **ʾalb**

   Egyptian: **maʿrafš**
   Levantine: **mā baʿref**

6. Different future tense markers:
   MSA: **sa-** or **sawfa** (will)
   Egyptian: **ḥa-**
   Levantine: **raḥ**

7. Borrowing from other languages:
   French influence in Maghrebi: **fōršēta** (fork, from French “fourchette”)
   English influence in Gulf: **bārkēn** (parking)

## Phonological Processes

### Assimilation

1. Sun and Moon Letters:
   The definite article **al-** assimilates to the following consonant if it's a “sun letter” (ت، ث، د، ذ، ر، ز، س، ش، ص، ض، ط، ظ، ل، ن):
   - **aš-šams** (the sun)
   - **an-nār** (the fire)
   But not with “moon letters”:
   - **al-qamar** (the moon)
   - **al-kitāb** (the book)

2. Assimilation of **n**:
   The **n** of tanwīn assimilates to a following **l** or **r**:
   - **rajulun laṭīfun** → **rajulul laṭīfun** (a kind man)

### Elision

1. Hamzat al-waṣl:
   The initial hamza (glottal stop) is dropped in connected speech:
   - **fī l-bayti** (in the house) instead of **fī al-bayti**

2. Dropping of final vowels:
   In pausa (at the end of an utterance), short final vowels are often dropped:
   - **al-kitābu** → **al-kitāb** (the book)
