# Modern Hebrew

Modern Hebrew, also known as Israeli Hebrew, is the official language of Israel and is spoken by approximately 9 million people worldwide. It is a Semitic language belonging to the Afroasiatic language family. Modern Hebrew is based on Biblical Hebrew but has undergone significant revival and modernization since the late 19th century.

## Writing System

Modern Hebrew uses the Hebrew alphabet, which consists of 22 letters. The script is written from right to left.

| Letter | Name | Pronunciation |
|--------|------|---------------|
| א | Alef | Silent or [ʔ] |
| ב | Bet | [b] or [v] |
| ג | Gimel | [g] or [ʒ] |
| ד | Dalet | [d] |
| ה | He | [h] or silent |
| ו | Vav | [v] or [o]/[u] |
| ז | Zayin | [z] |
| ח | Het | [χ] |
| ט | Tet | [t] |
| י | Yod | [j] or [i] |
| כ ך | Kaf | [k] or [χ] |
| ל | Lamed | [l] |
| מ ם | Mem | [m] |
| נ ן | Nun | [n] |
| ס | Samekh | [s] |
| ע | Ayin | [ʔ] or silent |
| פ ף | Pe | [p] or [f] |
| צ ץ | Tsadi | [ts] |
| ק | Qof | [k] |
| ר | Resh | [ʁ] |
| ש | Shin | [ʃ] or [s] |
| ת | Tav | [t] |

Five letters (כ, מ, נ, פ, צ) have a different form when used at the end of a word, known as the final form.

Vowels are typically not written in everyday Hebrew, but a system of diacritical marks called “nikud” exists for educational purposes and religious texts.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Modern Hebrew has 23 consonant phonemes:

| Manner | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| Plosive | p b |  | t d |  | k g |  | ʔ |
| Nasal | m |  | n |  |  |  |  |
| Fricative | f v | | s z | ʃ | | χ | h |
| Affricate |  |  | ts |  |  |  |  |
| Approximant |  |  | l | j |  | ʁ |  |

### Vowels

Modern Hebrew has 5 vowel phonemes:

| Front | Central | Back |
|-------|---------|------|
| i |  | u |
| e |  | o |
|  | a |  |

## Morphology

Hebrew morphology is based on a system of roots and patterns. Most words are derived from a three-consonant root, which carries the core meaning. Various patterns of vowels and affixes are applied to these roots to create different words and grammatical forms.

### Nouns

Nouns in Hebrew have two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural). Some nouns also have a dual form for naturally paired objects.

Examples:
- **ספר** /sefer/ “book” (masculine singular)
- **ספרים** /sfarim/ “books” (masculine plural)
- **מחברת** /maχberet/ “notebook” (feminine singular)
- **מחברות** /maχbarot/ “notebooks” (feminine plural)
- **יד** /jad/ “hand” (feminine singular)
- **ידיים** /jadajim/ “hands” (feminine dual)

#### Construct State (Smichut)

Hebrew uses a special form called the construct state to express possession or association between nouns. The first noun in the construction (the possessed) undergoes changes, while the second noun (the possessor) remains unchanged.

Examples:
- **בית ספר** /bet sefer/ “school” (literally “house of book”)
- **ספר ילדים** /sefer jeladim/ “children's book”
- **מכונת כביסה** /meχonat kvisa/ “washing machine” (literally “machine of washing”)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Hebrew agree with the noun they modify in gender and number. They typically follow the noun.

Examples:
- **ספר גדול** /sefer gadol/ “big book” (masculine singular)
- **ספרים גדולים** /sfarim gdolim/ “big books” (masculine plural)
- **מחברת גדולה** /maχberet gdola/ “big notebook” (feminine singular)
- **מחברות גדולות** /maχbarot gdolot/ “big notebooks” (feminine plural)

### Verbs

Hebrew verbs are conjugated for person, number, gender, tense, and aspect. They are typically derived from a three-consonant root and follow one of seven main patterns called “binyanim” (singular: binyan).

The seven binyanim are:
1. Pa'al (Qal)
2. Nif'al
3. Pi'el
4. Pu'al
5. Hitpa'el
6. Hif'il
7. Huf'al

Each binyan has its own conjugation pattern and often imparts a specific meaning or voice to the verb.

Example: The root ק-ט-ל (q-t-l) related to “killing”
- Pa'al: **קטל** /katal/ “he killed”
- Nif'al: **נקטל** /niktal/ “he was killed”
- Pi'el: **קיטל** /kitel/ “he massacred”
- Pu'al: **קוטל** /kutal/ “he was massacred”
- Hitpa'el: **התקטל** /hitka

tel/ “he got himself killed”
- Hif'il: **הקטיל** /hiktil/ “he caused to kill”
- Huf'al: **הוקטל** /huktal/ “he was caused to be killed”

#### Tenses

Modern Hebrew has three main tenses:
1. Past
2. Present
3. Future

Examples using the verb **ללמוד** /lilmod/ “to learn” in Pa'al binyan:

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by intonation or by using the question particle **האם** /ha'im/ at the beginning of the sentence:

- **אתה אוהב פיצה?** /ata ohev pitsa/ “Do you like pizza?”

### Negation

Negation is typically formed by using **לא** /lo/ before the verb:

- **אני לא אוהב פיצה** /ani lo ohev pitsa/ “I don’t like pizza”

For non-verbal sentences, **אין** /ejn/ is used:

- **אין לי זמן** /ejn li zman/ “I don’t have time”

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by the relative pronoun **ש** /ʃe/:

- **הספר שקניתי** /ha-sefer ʃe-kaniti/ “The book that I bought”

## Vocabulary

Modern Hebrew vocabulary comes from various sources:

1. Biblical and Mishnaic Hebrew
2. Borrowed words from Aramaic, Arabic, Yiddish, and other languages
3. Neologisms created by the Academy of the Hebrew Language

Examples:
- Biblical: **שמש** /ʃemeʃ/ “sun”, **מים** /majim/ “water”
- Aramaic: **אבא** /aba/ “father”, **אמא** /ima/ “mother”

### Numbers

Cardinal numbers 1-10:

| Number | Masculine | Feminine |
|--------|-----------|----------|

| 9 | **תשעה** /tiʃ'a/ | **תשע** /teʃa/ |
| 10 | **עשרה** /asara/ | **עשר** /eser/ |

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding the suffix **י-** /-i/ to the cardinal number:

- **ראשון** /riʃon/ “first”
- **שני** /ʃeni/ “second”
- **שלישי** /ʃliʃi/ “third”

## Colloquial Hebrew

Colloquial Hebrew, often referred to as “Street Hebrew” or “Spoken Hebrew,” differs in several ways from the formal, written language:

1. Pronunciation:
   - The phoneme /ʕ/ (ayin) is often pronounced as [ʔ] or omitted entirely.
   - The phoneme /h/ is often dropped in rapid speech.
   - The distinction between /a/ and /ɛ/ is often neutralized.

2. Vocabulary:
   - Many slang terms and loanwords are used, especially from English, Arabic, and Russian.
   Example: **וואלה** /walla/ (from Arabic) “really, wow”

3. Grammar:
   - The dual form is often replaced by the plural in spoken language.
   - The future tense is sometimes used instead of the imperative.
   Example: **תביא לי את זה** /tavi li et ze/ “Bring me that” (lit. “You will bring me that”)

4. Sentence structure:
   - Object pronouns are often doubled for emphasis.
   Example: **ראיתי אותו, את יוסי** /ra'iti oto, et josi/ “I saw him, Yossi”

5. Discourse markers:
   - Frequent use of filler words like **כאילו** /ke'ilu/ “like”, **בקיצור** /bekitsur/ “in short”

These colloquial features are an important aspect of everyday communication inModern Hebrew and are essential for learners to understand and use in informal contexts. Let's continue with more details on Modern Hebrew:

## Word Formation

Hebrew has several productive methods for forming new words:

### Root and Pattern System

Most Hebrew words are built from a three-consonant root combined with a specific vowel pattern and/or affixes. This system allows for the creation of many related words from a single root.

Example using the root ס-פ-ר (s-f-r) related to “counting/telling”:
- **ספר** /sefer/ “book”
- **סיפור** /sipur/ “story”
- **ספרייה** /sifrija/ “library”
- **מספר** /mispar/ “number”
- **ספרן** /safran/ “librarian”
- **לספור** /lispor/ “to count”

### Acronyms

Hebrew frequently uses acronyms, which are often pronounced as words:
- **תנ“ך** /tanaχ/ (Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim) ”Hebrew Bible“
- **צה”ל** /tsahal/ (Tzva Haganah L'Yisrael) “Israel Defense Forces”

### Loanwords

Modern Hebrew has adopted many loanwords, especially for modern concepts:
- **טלפון** /telefon/ “telephone” (from English)
- **אינטרנט** /internet/ “internet” (from English)
- **פלאפל** /falafel/ “falafel” (from Arabic)

## Verbal System

### Infinitives

Hebrew infinitives are formed by adding the prefix **ל-** /le-/ to the verb stem:
- **לכתוב** /liχtov/ “to write”
- **לאכול** /le'eχol/ “to eat”

### Participles

Hebrew uses participles (present tense forms) as adjectives and nouns:
- **מעניין** /me'anjen/ “interesting” (from the verb “to interest”)
- **מורה** /more/ “teacher” (from the verb “to teach”)

### Imperative

The imperative mood is used for commands:
- **שב!** /ʃev/ “Sit!” (masculine singular)
- **שבי!** /ʃvi/ “Sit!” (feminine singular)
- **שבו!** /ʃvu/ “Sit!” (plural)

### Modal Verbs

Hebrew uses several modal verbs to express possibility, necessity, or ability:
- **יכול** /jaχol/ “can, be able to”
- **צריך** /tsariχ/ “need to, have to”
- **מוכרח** /muχraχ/ “must”

Example:
- **אני יכול לעזור לך** /ani jaχol la'azor leχa/ “I can help you”

## Syntax

### Copula

In the present tense, Hebrew often omits the copula (“to be”):
- **הוא מורה** /hu more/ “He (is) a teacher”

In past and future tenses, the verb **להיות** /lihjot/ “to be” is used:
- **הוא היה מורה** /hu haja more/ “He was a teacher”
- **הוא יהיה מורה** /hu jihje more/ “He will be a teacher”

### Definiteness

The definite article **ה-** /ha-/ is used to mark definiteness:
- **ספר** /sefer/ “a book”
- **הספר** /ha-sefer/ “the book”

When an adjective modifies a definite noun, it also takes the definite article:
- **הספר הגדול** /ha-sefer ha-gadol/ “the big book”

### Possession

Possession can be expressed in several ways:

1. Construct state (already mentioned)
2. Possessive pronouns (already mentioned)
3. Using the preposition **של** /ʃel/ “of”:
   - **הספר של דן** /ha-sefer ʃel dan/ “Dan's book” (lit. “the book of Dan”)

### Object Marking

Direct objects are often marked with the particle **את** /et/ before definite nouns:
- **אני אוהב את הספר** /ani ohev et ha-sefer/ “I love the book”

## Phonological Processes

### Assimilation

Hebrew exhibits various assimilation processes:

1. Voicing assimilation:
   - **לסגור** /lisgor/ “to close” → **יסגור** /jisgor/ “he will close”

2. Place assimilation:
   - **בבית** /ba-bajit/ “in the house” (underlying form /be-bajit/)

### Stress

Stress in Hebrew is generally on the final syllable (milra), with some exceptions:
- **תַּפּוּחַ** /ta'puaχ/ “apple”
- **שׁוֹקוֹלָד** /ʃoko'lad/ “chocolate”

Some words have penultimate stress (mil'el):
- **אֶצְבַּע** /'etsba/ “finger”
- **יֶלֶד** /'jeled/ “boy”

## Discourse Features

### Connectives

Hebrew uses various connectives to link clauses and sentences:
- **ו-** /ve-/ “and”
- **או** /o/ “or”
- **אבל** /aval/ “but”
- **כי** /ki/ “because”
- **לכן** /laχen/ “therefore”

Example:
- **רציתי ללכת לים, אבל ירד גשם** /ratsiti laleχet la-jam, aval jarad geʃem/
  “I wanted to go to the beach, but it rained”

### Emphasis

Emphasis can be achieved through word order or specific constructions:
1. Fronting: 
   - **את הספר הזה אני אוהב** /et ha-sefer ha-ze ani ohev/ “This book, I love”

2. Cleft sentences:
   - **זה דן שאוהב ספרים** /ze dan ʃe-ohev sfarim/ “It's Dan who loves books”

3. Repetition:
   - **הוא חכם חכם** /hu χaχam χaχam/ “He is very smart” (lit. “He is smart smart”)

## Pragmatics

### Politeness

Hebrew has several politeness strategies:

1. Using formal pronouns (less common in modern usage):
   - **אתם** /atem/ (plural “you”) used for a single person

2. Using modal verbs:
   - **אפשר לקבל...?** /efʃar lekabel...?/ “Is it possible to get...?”

3. Using the future tense instead of imperative:
   - **תוכל לעזור לי?** /tuχal la'azor li?/ “Could you help me?” (lit. “Will you be able to help me?”)

### Interjections

Hebrew uses various interjections in everyday speech:
- **וואי** /waj/ expressing surprise or excitement
- **אוי** /oj/ expressing pain or dismay
- **יאללה** /jalla/ “come on, let's go” (from Arabic)

## Register and Style

Hebrew exhibits significant differences between formal and informal registers:

Formal:
- More use of passive voice
- Biblical or literary vocabulary
- Complex sentence structures

Informal:
- More use of active voice
- Colloquial expressions and slang
- Simpler sentence structures

Example:
Formal: **הוחלט כי הישיבה תידחה** /huχlat ki ha-jeʃiva tidaχe/ 
“It was decided that the meeting would be postponed”

Informal: **החליטו לדחות את הישיבה** /heχlitu lidχot et ha-jeʃiva/
“They decided to postpone the meeting”

## Dialectal Variations

While Modern Hebrew is relatively uniform, there are some dialectal variations:

1. Sephardi pronunciation:
   - Distinction between /ʕ/ and /ʔ/
   - Pronunciation of ר as [r] instead of [ʁ]

2. Ashkenazi influence:
   - Pronunciation of ח as [x] instead of [χ]
   - Use of Yiddish loanwords

3. Arabic influence:
   - Use of Arabic loanwords and expressions, especially among Mizrahi Jews

These dialectal features are becoming less prominent as the language continues to standardize, but they can still be observed in certain communities or among older speakers.
