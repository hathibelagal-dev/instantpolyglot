# Scots

Scots is a West Germanic language variety spoken in Scotland and parts of Ulster in Ireland. It is closely related to English, with which it forms a dialect continuum. Scots has approximately 1.5 million speakers, primarily in Scotland. Despite its close relationship with English, Scots has distinct phonological, grammatical, and lexical features that set it apart.

### Word order

The basic word order in Scots is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), like English:

However, Scots allows for more flexibility in word order for emphasis or stylistic reasons:

Scots allows for the use of double modal verbs, which is not possible in Standard English:

### Preposition stranding

Like English, Scots allows preposition stranding:

- **Wha did ye gie it tae?** (Who did you give it to?)

Tag questions in Scots often use **eh** or **aye**:

## Influences on Scots

Scots has been influenced by various languages throughout its history:

1. Old English: The primary basis for Scots.
   Example: **bairn** (child) from Old English “bearn”

2. Old Norse: Due to Viking invasions and settlements.
   Example: **kirk** (church) from Old Norse “kirkja”

   Example: **glen** (valley) from Gaelic “gleann”

5. Dutch: Through trade connections in the late medieval period.
   Example: **cowp** (overturn) from Dutch “kopen”

6. Modern English: Ongoing influence due to close contact.
   Example: **computer** (computer)

## Phonology

Scots phonology differs from Standard English in several ways:

1. The Scottish Vowel Length Rule (Aitken's Law): Long vowels are shortened before /r/, /t/, and /d/.
   Example: **meet** [mit] vs **mead** [mid]

2. Preservation of the /x/ sound (velar fricative):
   Example: **loch** [lɔx] (lake)

3. Distinctive /ʍ/ sound for “wh” words:
   Example: **whit** [ʍɪt] (what)

4. Rhoticity: /r/ is pronounced in all positions.
   Example: **car** [kɑr]

5. Glottal stop replacing /t/ in certain positions:
   Example: **water** [wɑʔər]

6. Distinctive diphthongs:
   Example: **hoose** [hʌus] (house)

7. L-vocalization in some dialects:
   Example: **aul** [ɔː] (old)

## Grammar particularities

### Definite article

The definite article “the” in Scots has several forms depending on the following sound:

1. **the** [ðə] before consonants: **the hoose** (the house)
2. **th'** [ð] before vowels: **th'aipple** (the apple)
3. **thae** [ðe] for plural nouns: **thae bairns** (those children)

In some dialects, particularly in Northeast Scots (Doric), the definite article is often omitted:

- **Gie's buik** (Give me the book)

### Demonstratives

Scots uses a three-way demonstrative system:

1. **this** - near the speaker
2. **that** - near the listener
3. **yon** - distant from both speaker and listener

Example: **This hoose, that hoose, and yon hoose ower there** (This house, that house, and that house over there)

### Plural you

Scots distinguishes between singular and plural “you”:

- Singular: **ye**, **you**
- Plural: **yese**, **yiz**, **yous** (depending on dialect)

Example: **Are yous aw comin tae the pairty?** (Are you all coming to the party?)

### Reflexive pronouns

Reflexive pronouns in Scots often use **-sel** (singular) and **-sels** (plural):

- **masel** (myself)
- **yersel** (yourself)
- **hissel** (himself)
- **hersel** (herself)
- **itsel** (itself)
- **oorsels** (ourselves)
- **yersels** (yourselves)
- **theirsels** (themselves)

Example: **A hurt masel** (I hurt myself)

### Emphatic pronouns

Emphatic forms of pronouns are created by adding **-ain**:

- **ma-ain** (my own)
- **yer-ain** (your own)
- **his-ain** (his own)
- **her-ain** (her own)
- **oor-ain** (our own)
- **their-ain** (their own)

Example: **That's ma-ain hoose** (That's my own house)

### Verbal nouns

Scots uses verbal nouns (gerunds) more extensively than Standard English, often with the preposition “o” (of):

- **the makkin o the cake** (the making of the cake)
- **the singin o the sang** (the singing of the song)

### Negation with “never”

Scots often uses “never” for strong negation in the past tense, where Standard English would use “didn't”:

- **A never saw him** (I didn't see him)
- **She never telt me** (She didn't tell me)

### Use of “intil” and “ontil”

Scots uses “intil” and “ontil” where Standard English uses “into” and “onto”:

- **He fell intil the loch** (He fell into the lake)
- **She climbed ontil the roof** (She climbed onto the roof)

### Adverbial use of adjectives

In Scots, many adjectives can be used as adverbs without changing form:

- **He ran quick** (He ran quickly)
- **She sings bonnie** (She sings beautifully)

### Intensifiers

Scots uses several unique intensifiers:

- **gey** (very): **It's gey cauld the day** (It's very cold today)
- **awfy** (awfully, very): **She's awfy bonnie** (She's very pretty)
- **unco** (uncommonly, very): **He's unco tall** (He's uncommonly tall)

### Compound prepositions

Scots has several compound prepositions not found in Standard English:

- **aff o** (off of): **Get aff o that chair** (Get off of that chair)
- **oot o** (out of): **A'm oot o money** (I'm out of money)
- **ower by** (over to): **A'm gaun ower by the shop** (I'm going over to the shop)

### Conditional perfect

Scots can use the conditional perfect where Standard English would use a simple past:

- **A wad hae thocht ye kent that** (I thought you knew that)

### Future progressive

Scots often uses “gan” (going) to form the future progressive:

- **A'm gan tae be workin aw day** (I'm going to be working all day)

### Habitual “be”

In some Scots dialects, “be” can be used to express habitual action:

- **He be gangin tae the pub ilka Friday** (He goes to the pub every Friday)

### Multiple negation

Unlike Standard English, Scots allows and often encourages multiple negation:

- **A'm no daein naethin** (I'm not doing nothing = I'm not doing anything)

### Cleft sentences

Scots makes extensive use of cleft sentences for emphasis:

- **It's him that A saw** (It's him that I saw)
- **It wis yesterday that she cam** (It was yesterday that she came)

### Tag questions

Scots uses various forms of tag questions:

- **eh**: **It's a braw day, eh?** (It's a fine day, isn’t it?)
- **is it no**: **Ye're comin, is it no?** (You're coming, aren’t you?)
- **aye**: **Ye ken whit A mean, aye?** (You know what I mean, right?)

### Reciprocal pronouns

Scots uses “ane anither” for “each other” or “one another”:

- **They aye help ane anither** (They always help each other)

### Elision

Scots often elides vowels in pronunciation and spelling:

- **I'll** becomes **A'll**
- **cannae** becomes **canna**
- **going to** becomes **gan tae** or even **gonnae**

Example: **A'm gonnae dae it the morn** (I'm going to do it tomorrow)

These grammatical features contribute to the distinct character of Scots and reflect its historical development as a separate language from English. While some features are shared with certain English dialects, the combination and extent of these characteristics set Scots apart as its own linguistic system.
