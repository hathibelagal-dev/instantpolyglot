# Hausa

Hausa is a Chadic language within the Afroasiatic family, spoken primarily in northern Nigeria and southern Niger. It serves as a lingua franca across much of West Africa and is one of the most widely spoken languages in Africa, with an estimated 40-50 million native speakers and many more second-language speakers. Hausa has a rich literary tradition and is used in media, education, and commerce throughout the region.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Hausa has a rich consonant inventory, including implosives and ejectives. Here's a detailed chart of Hausa consonants:

| | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plosive | b p | d t | | k g | ʔ |
| Implosive | ɓ | ɗ | | | |
| Ejective | | tʼ | | kʼ | |
| Nasal | m | n | | | |
| Fricative | ɸ | s z | ʃ ʒ | | h |
| Approximant | w | l r | j | | |
| Lateral | | l | | | |

Some notable features of Hausa consonants:

1. Implosives (**ɓ** and **ɗ**): These are produced with a downward movement of the glottis, creating a “popping” sound. 
   Example: **ɓera** (mouse), **ɗan adam** (human being)

2. Ejectives (**tʼ** and **kʼ**): These are produced with a simultaneous closure of the glottis, creating a sharp, explosive sound.
   Example: **tʼinkaho** (rice), **kʼarfe** (metal)

3. Glottal stop (**ʔ**): This is often not represented in writing but is present in many words.
   Example: **sa'a** [saʔa] (time, luck)

4. The distinction between **ƙ** (an ejective) and **k** (a regular plosive) is important:
   **ƙara** (increase) vs. **kara** (corn stalk)

### Vowels

Hausa has 5 vowel qualities, each with a short and long version:

| | Front | Central | Back |
|---|---|---|---|
| Close | i iː | | u uː |
| Mid | e eː | | o oː |
| Open | | a aː | |

Long vowels are phonemically distinct from short vowels and can change the meaning of words:

**gara** (to be better than) vs. **gaara** (reconciliation)
**ciki** (inside) vs. **ciiki** (stomach)

### Tone

Hausa is a tonal language with three phonemic tones:

1. High tone (́)
2. Low tone (̀)
3. Falling tone (̂)

Tone is used to distinguish both lexical and grammatical meanings. Some examples:

Lexical distinctions:
**tsàuri** (hardness) vs. **tsáuri** (judgment)
**fàɗi** (breadth) vs. **fáɗì** (fall)

Grammatical distinctions:
**yā tàfi** (he went) vs. **yá tàfi** (let him go)
**nā gāni** (I saw) vs. **nà gāni** (I see)

Tonal patterns can also indicate grammatical information such as tense and aspect:

**Yā tàfi.** (He went.) - Completive aspect
**Yanā tāfiyā.** (He is going.) - Continuous aspect

### Syllable structure

The most common syllable structure in Hausa is CV (consonant-vowel), but CVC and VC structures also occur. Some examples:

CV: **ba** (to give), **ci** (to eat)
CVC: **dam** (to last), **sun** (they)
VC: **ai** (indeed), **in** (if)

Hausa also allows for consonant clusters, particularly in borrowed words:
CVCC: **hankʼ** (hiccup)
CCVC: **tsakā** (midst)

## Orthography

Hausa is written in two different scripts: a Latin-based alphabet (Boko) and an Arabic-based script (Ajami). The Boko script is more commonly used in formal contexts and education.

### Boko alphabet

The Boko alphabet consists of the following letters:

a b ɓ c d ɗ e f g h i j k ƙ l m n o p r s sh t ts u w y ƴ z

Long vowels are represented by doubling the vowel letter: aa, ee, ii, oo, uu.

Examples:
**kaakaa** (grandfather)
**shuugaba** (leader)
**tsaamiyaa** (tamarind)

Tone is generally not marked in standard orthography, except in linguistic works or language learning materials. When marked, diacritics are used:

**yârā** (children)
**màcè** (woman)
**búkā** (feast)

### Ajami script

The Ajami script is based on the Arabic alphabet with some modifications. It's still used in some religious and traditional contexts. Here's an example of Hausa written in Ajami:

ربّنا هب لنا من أزواجنا وذرّيّاتنا قرّة أعين واجعلنا للمتّقين إماما

(Romanized: Rabbanā hab lanā min azwājinā wa dhurrīyātinā qurrata aʿyunin wa-jʿalnā li-l-muttaqīna imāmā)

In Boko script: **Ubangijinmu, Ka ba mu maza da mata da 'ya'ya masu sa farin ciki a zuciyarmu, kuma Ka sanya mu shugabanni ga masu tsoron Allah.**

(Translation: Our Lord, grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes and make us an example for the righteous.)

## Morphology

### Nouns

Hausa nouns have two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. Gender is often unpredictable and must be learned for each noun. However, there are some patterns:

- Most nouns ending in -a are feminine: **riga** (gown), **kafa** (leg), **ruwa** (water)
- Most nouns ending in other vowels are masculine: **gida** (house), **hannu** (hand), **zomo** (hare)

There are exceptions to these patterns:
Masculine nouns ending in -a: **baba** (father), **gwarwa** (crow)
Feminine nouns not ending in -a: **uwa** (mother), **yarinya** (girl)

#### Plurals

Hausa has a complex system of plural formation with many different patterns. Some common ones include:

1. Suffix -oCI: 
   **gida** (house) → **gidaje** (houses)
   **kaza** (chicken) → **kazoji** (chickens)
   **biri** (monkey) → **biraje** (monkeys)

2. Suffix -una:
   **aboki** (friend) → **abokai** (friends)
   **malami** (teacher) → **malamai** (teachers)
   **ɗalibi** (student) → **ɗalibai** (students)

3. Suffix -anni:
   **talaka** (commoner) → **talakawa** (commoners)
   **bature** (European) → **turawa** (Europeans)

4. Internal vowel change:
   **doki** (horse) → **dawakai** (horses)
   **mace** (woman) → **mata** (women)
   **yaro** (boy) → **yara** (boys)

5. Reduplication:
   **kaza** (chicken) → **kazazuwa** (chickens)
   **gari** (town) → **garuruwa** (towns)

6. Irregular plurals:
   **mutum** (person) → **mutane** (people)
   **ido** (eye) → **idanu** (eyes)

Some nouns have multiple plural forms, sometimes with different meanings:
**hannu** (hand) → **hannaye** (hands) or **hannayen** (handles)

#### Noun derivation

Hausa has several ways to derive nouns from other words:

1. Agent nouns (formed with ma-):
   **rubuta** (to write) → **marubuchi** (writer)
   **sayi** (to buy) → **masayi** (buyer)

2. Abstract nouns (various suffixes):
   **kyau** (good) → **kyauta** (goodness)
   **tsoro** (fear) → **tsanani** (severity)

3. Instrumental nouns (ma- prefix):
   **wanke** (to wash) → **masabki** (washing implement)
   **dafe** (to cook) → **madafi** (cooking utensil)

### Pronouns

Hausa has a rich pronoun system that distinguishes person, number, gender, and in some cases, formality.

Personal pronouns:

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|---|---|
| 1st person | ni / na (I, me) | mu (we, us) |
| 2nd person | kai (m), ke (f) (you) | ku (you) |
| 3rd person | shi (m), ita (f) (he, she, it) | su (they, them) |

These pronouns are used as subjects in certain tenses:
**Ni na tafi.** (I went.)
**Kai ka tafi.** (You went.)

In other tenses, different pronoun sets are used:

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|---|---|
| 1st person | na | mun |
| 2nd person | ka (m), ki (f) | kun |
| 3rd person | ya (m), ta (f) | sun |

Example:
**Na tafi.** (I went.)
**Ka tafi.** (You went.)

Possessive pronouns:

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|---|---|
| 1st person | na / ta (my) | namu / tamu (our) |
| 2nd person | naka / taka (m), naki / taki (f) (your) | naku / taku (your) |
| 3rd person | nasa / tasa (m), nata / tata (f) (his, her, its) | nasu / tasu (their) |

The choice between na-/ta- forms depends on the gender of the possessed noun:
**littafina** (my book, m)
**rigata** (my gown, f)

Examples:
**Wannan littafina ne.** (This is my book.)
**Wadannan litattafansu ne.** (These are their books.)

Object pronouns are often suffixed to verbs:
**Na ganshi.** (I saw him.)
**Ta buɗe ta.** (She opened it.)

### Verbs

Hausa verbs are marked for tense, aspect, and mood through a combination of prefixes, suffixes, and tone patterns.

#### Verb grades

Hausa verbs are classified into seven “grades” based on their morphological and syntactic behavior. Each grade has its own pattern of forming different tenses and aspects.

1. Grade 1: Basic transitive verbs
   Example: **kama** (to catch)
   - Completive: **Ya kama kifi.** (He caught a fish.)
   - Continuous: **Yana kama kifi.** (He is catching a fish.)
   - Subjunctive: **Ya kama kifi.** (Let him catch a fish.)

2. Grade 2: Transitive verbs with object focus
   Example: **sayar** (to sell)
   - Completive: **Ya sayar da mota.** (He sold a car.)
   - Continuous: **Yana sayarwa da mota.** (He is selling a car.)

3. Grade 3: Causative and efferential verbs
   Example: **fitar** (to take out)

   - Continuous: **Yana dawowa.** (He is coming back.)

7. Grade 7: Sustentative verbs (sustained or intensive action)
   Example: **tarku** (to hobble along)
   - Completive: **Ya tarku.** (He hobbled along.)
   - Continuous: **Yana tarkuwa.** (He is hobbling along.)

#### Tense and Aspect

Hausa has a rich system of tense and aspect marking. Some key distinctions include:

1. Completive (past/perfective):
   **Na ci abinci.** (I ate food.)
   **Mun gama aiki.** (We finished work.)

2. Continuous:
   **Ina cin abinci.** (I am eating food.)

#### Verbal Nouns

Many Hausa verbs have corresponding verbal nouns, which are used in various grammatical constructions:

**karanta** (to read) → **karatu** (reading)
**rubutà** (to write) → **rubutu** (writing)
**koya** (to teach) → **koyarwa** (teaching)

Example:
**Ina son karatu.** (I like reading.)

#### Verb derivation

Hausa has several ways to derive new verbs:

1. Causative: add -ar or -as
   **fita** (to go out) → **fitar** (to take out)
   **shiga** (to enter) → **shigar** (to put in)

2. Ventive: add -o
   **kawo** (to bring) from **kai** (to take)
   **sayo** (to buy and bring) from **saya** (to buy)

3. Intensives: reduplication
   **daka** (to beat) → **dandaka** (to beat thoroughly)
   **murza** (to squeeze) → **murmurza** (to squeeze repeatedly)

### Adjectives

Hausa adjectives usually follow the noun they modify and agree in gender and number:

**babban gida** (big house, m)
**manya-manyan gidaje** (big houses)

Some adjectives have distinct masculine and feminine forms:

**sabon keke** (new bicycle, m)
**sabuwar mota** (new car, f)
**kyakkyawan yaro** (handsome boy)
**kyakkyawar yarinya** (beautiful girl)

Adjectives can also be used predicatively:

**Gidan nan babba ne.** (This house is big.)
**Rigar nan sabuwa ce.** (This gown is new.)

Comparative and superlative forms are often formed analytically:

Comparative: **fi** (to surpass)
**Audu ya fi Bala tsayi.** (Audu is taller than Bala.)

Superlative: **mafi** (the most)
**Audu shi ne mafi tsayi a cikin ƙungiyar.** (Audu is the tallest in the group.)

Some adjectives can be intensified through reduplication:

**fari** (white) → **fari fat** (very white)
**baki** (black) → **baki ƙirin** (pitch black)

### Adverbs

Many Hausa adverbs are formed by reduplication of adjectives:

**sanyi** (cold) → **sanyi-sanyi** (coldly)
**sauri** (quick) → **sauri-sauri** (quickly)
**hankali** (careful) → **hankali-hankali** (carefully)

Example:
**Ya tafi sauri-sauri.** (He went quickly.)
**Ta yi aiki hankali-hankali.** (She worked carefully.)

Other adverbs are derived from nouns or other parts of speech:

**yau** (today)
**gobe** (tomorrow)
**jiya** (yesterday)
**nan da nan** (immediately)
**kulum** (always)

Adverbs typically occur at the end of a sentence:

**Sun iso jiya.** (They arrived yesterday.)
**Zan dawo gobe.** (I will return tomorrow.)

### Prepositions

Hausa uses prepositions to indicate spatial, temporal, and other relationships. Some common prepositions include:

**a** (at, in, on)
**da** (with)
**daga** (from)
**ga** (to, for)
**kan** (on top of)
**karkashin** (under)
**tsakanin** (between)

Examples:
**Yana a gida.** (He is at home.)
**Ta tafi da ƙanwarta.** (She went with her younger sister.)
**Mun fito daga Kano.** (We came from Kano.)
**Littafin yana kan tebur.** (The book is on the table.)

Some prepositions can combine with others or with nouns to form complex prepositions:

**a kan** (on top of)
**a cikin** (inside)
**a gaban** (in front of)

Example:
**Mota tana a gaban gida.** (The car is in front of the house.)

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Hausa is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):

**Audu ya sayi mota.** (Audu bought a car.)
**Yara suna wasa.** (The children are playing.)

However, Hausa allows for some flexibility in word order for emphasis or in certain grammatical constructions.

### Questions

Yes/no questions are typically formed by adding the particle **ko** at the end of a statement:

**Kun gama aikin ko?** (Have you finished the work?)
**Za ka tafi gobe ko?** (Will you go tomorrow?)

Intonation can also be used to form yes/no questions:

**Kun gama aikin?** (Have you finished the work?)

Wh-questions use interrogative words such as:

- **wa** (who)
- **me** (what)
- **ina** (where)
- **yaushe** (when)
- **yaya** (how)
- **nawa** (how many/much)

Examples:
**Wa ya sayi wannan mota?** (Who bought this car?)
**Ina kake zaune?** (Where do you live?)
**Yaya suka yi haka?** (How did they do that?)

The interrogative word typically comes at the beginning of the question, but the rest of the word order remains the same:

**Me kuke so?** (What do you want?)
**Yaushe za ku dawo?** (When will you return?)

### Negation

Negation in Hausa is typically expressed using the particle **ba** before and after the clause:

**Ba na son shāyi ba.** (I don’t like tea.)
**Ba za su zo ba.** (They won’t come.)

In some tenses, only the final **ba** is used:

**Bai zo ba.** (He didn't come.)
**Ban san shi ba.** (I don’t know him.)

In imperative sentences, **kada** is used for negation:

**Kada ka tafi.** (Don’t go.)
**Kada ku yi haka.** (Don’t do that.)

### Focus and Topicalization

Hausa has several ways to emphasize or focus on particular elements of a sentence:

1. Fronting:
   **Mota ce Audu ya saya.** (It's a car that Audu bought.)
   **Gobe ne za mu tafi.** (It's tomorrow that we will go.)

2. Copula **ne/ce**:
   **Audu ne ya sayi mota.** (It's Audu who bought a car.)
   **Jiya ce ta zo.** (It was yesterday that she came.)

3. Focus particles:
   **Sai Bala ya zo.** (Only Bala came.)
   **Har Maryam ta san labarin.** (Even Maryam knows the story.)

### Compound Sentences

Coordination is often achieved using conjunctions such as:

- **da** (and)
- **ko** (or)
- **amma** (but)
- **saboda haka** (therefore)
- **don haka** (so, therefore)
- **ko da yake** (although)

Examples:
**Na je kasuwa da na sayi kayan abinci.** (I went to the market and bought groceries.)
**Zan tafi ko zan zauna a gida.** (I will go or I will stay at home.)
**Ina son shan ruwa amma babu ruwa a nan.** (I want to drink water but there's no water here.)
**Ba shi da kuɗi, saboda haka bai sayi mota ba.** (He doesn’t have money, therefore he didn't buy a car.)

### Complex Sentences

Subordinate clauses in Hausa are often introduced by conjunctions such as:

- **cewa** (that)
- **domin** (because)
- **idan** (if)
- **sa'ad da** (when)
- **kafin** (before)
- **bayan** (after)

Examples:
**Na san cewa za ka zo.** (I know that you will come.)
**Idan ka zo, za mu tafi tare.** (If you come, we will go together.)
**Ba za mu fara ba sai idan kowa ya iso.** (We won’t start until everyone has arrived.)
**Sa'ad da na iso gida, sai na gan shi.** (When I arrived home, I saw him.)

Relative clauses are formed using the relative pronoun **da**:

**Mutumin da ya zo jiya shine ɗan'uwana.** (The man who came yesterday is my brother.)
**Littafin da na karanta yana da kyau.** (The book that I read is good.)

## Idiomatic Expressions

## Dialectal Variations

While Standard Hausa is based on the Kano dialect, there are several other dialects with notable differences:

1. Sokoto dialect: 
   - Uses **shi** instead of **ya** for “he” in some constructions
   - Example: **Shi zo** (Sokoto) vs. **Ya zo** (Standard) - “He came”
   - Some vocabulary differences: **gafara** (Sokoto) vs. **gafarta** (Standard) - “to forgive”

2. Zaria dialect:
   - Often drops final vowels
   - Example: **littaf** (Zaria) vs. **littafi** (Standard) - “book”
   - Some unique pronunciations: **tsatsa** (Zaria) vs. **tsaurara** (Standard) - “to tighten”

3. Bauchi dialect:

   - Example: **guzuma** (Bauchi) vs. **gada** (Standard) - “groundnut”
   - Different pronunciations: **burtu** (Bauchi) vs. **budu** (Standard) - “blanket”

4. Katsina dialect:
   - Some vocabulary differences
   - Example: **ci** (Katsina) vs. **sha** (Standard) - “to drink”
   - Phonological differences: tendency to pronounce **ƙ** as **k**

5. Daura dialect:
   - Known for its archaic features
   - Retains some sounds lost in other dialects
   - Example: **nufin** (Daura) vs. **nufin** (Standard) - “intention” (pronounced differently)

Despite these differences, most Hausa speakers can understand each other across dialects.

6. French (often via other languages):
   **fotor** (photo), **asibiti** (hospital), **lamisir** (mayor)

Many of these loanwords have been fully integrated into Hausa and follow Hausa phonological and morphological patterns.

## Numbers

Hausa has a decimal number system. Here are the basic numerals:

1 - **ɗaya**
2 - **biyu**
3 - **uku**
4 - **huɗu**
5 - **biyar**
6 - **shida**
7 - **bakwai**
8 - **takwas**
9 - **tara**
10 - **goma**

Numbers 11-19 are formed by adding **sha** (and) between the ones and tens:
11 - **goma sha ɗaya**
12 - **goma sha biyu**
13 - **goma sha uku**
...
19 - **goma sha tara**

Multiples of ten are:
20 - **ashirin**
30 - **talatin**
40 - **arba'in**
50 - **hamsin**
60 - **sitti**
70 - **saba'in**
80 - **tamanin**
90 - **casa'in**

For numbers between multiples of ten, **da** (and) is used:
21 - **ashirin da ɗaya**
45 - **arba'in da biyar**
78 - **saba'in da takwas**

100 - **ɗari**
1000 - **dubu**
1,000,000 - **miliyan**

When counting objects, Hausa uses a system of prefixes that agree with the gender of the noun being counted. For masculine nouns, **-n** is used, and for feminine nouns, **-r** is used:

**littafi ɗaya** (one book)
**littattafai biyu** (two books)
**littattafai uku** (three books)
**littattafai huɗu** (four books)
**littattafai biyar** (five books)

**mota ɗaya** (one car)
**motoci biyu** (two cars)
**motoci uku** (three cars)
**motoci huɗu** (four cars)
**motoci biyar** (five cars)

Example:
**Ina da littattafai ɗari da goma sha biyar.** (I have 115 books.)
**Mun sayi motoci ashirin da uku.** (We bought 23 cars.)

## Greetings and Politeness

Greetings are an important part of Hausa culture and often involve a back-and-forth exchange:

A: **Sannu!** (Hello!)
B: **Sannu kadai!** (Hello to you too!)

A: **Ina kwana?** (How did you sleep?)
B: **Lafiya lau!** (Very well!)

Time-specific greetings:
Morning: **Ina kwana?** (How did you sleep?)
Afternoon: **Ina wuni?** (How's your day?)
Evening: **Ina yini?** (How was your day?)

Respect is shown through language use, including:

1. Using **ranka ya dade** (may your life be long) when addressing superiors or elders
2. Using plural forms for polite address, even to individuals
3. Using titles like **Alhaji**, **Hajiya**, **Malam**, or **Inna** before names
4. Using **ku** (plural you) instead of **ka/ki** (singular you) for respect

Example:
**Sannu Alhaji, ina wuni?** (Hello sir, how's your day?)
**Yaya lafiya, Hajiya?** (How are you, madam?)

When entering a house or a gathering, it's polite to say:
**Assalamu alaikum** (Peace be upon you)
To which the response is:
**Wa alaikum salam** (And peace be upon you)

When leaving, one might say:
**Sai an jima** (Until later)
**Allah ya kiyaye** (May God protect [you])

Expressions of gratitude:
**Na gode** (Thank you)
**Allah ya saka da alheri** (May God reward you with goodness)

Expressions of apology:
**Yi haƙuri** (Be patient / I'm sorry)
**Allah ya yafe** (May God forgive)

This comprehensive overview covers many key aspects of the Hausa language, providing a solid foundation for understanding its structure and usage. Remember that language is always evolving, and regional variations may exist.
