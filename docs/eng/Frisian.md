# Frisian

Frisian is a West Germanic language closely related to English and Dutch. It is spoken by approximately 500,000 people, primarily in the Dutch province of Friesland (Fryslân) and in small parts of Germany. The term "Frisian" actually refers to three distinct but related languages: West Frisian (spoken in the Netherlands), North Frisian (spoken in Germany), and East Frisian (nearly extinct, formerly spoken in Germany). This overview will focus primarily on West Frisian, as it is the most widely spoken variety.

### Phonological Processes

1. Final devoicing: Like Dutch and German, Frisian devoices final obstruents.
   Example: **hûs** (house) is pronounced [huːs], not [huːz]

2. Assimilation: Consonants often assimilate in voicing to adjacent consonants.
   Example: **hotbal** (meatball) is often pronounced more like [ˈhɔdbal]

3. Vowel breaking: Some vowels "break" into diphthongs in certain environments.
   Example: **beam** (tree) [bɪəm] vs. **beammen** (trees) [bjɛmən]

4. R-coloring: The presence of /r/ can affect the quality of preceding vowels.
   Example: **bear** (bear) is pronounced more like [bɪər] than [beːr]

## Orthography

Frisian uses the Latin alphabet with some additional letters and digraphs. The orthography is generally phonemic, but there are some irregularities.

Special letters and digraphs:

- â, ê, ô: Long vowels
- û: Represents /u/ or /ʏ/
- ú: Represents /y/
- ii: Represents /i:/
- oa: Represents /oə/
- ue: Represents /yə/
- ij: Represents /ɛi/
- ch: Represents /x/
- sz: Represents /s/ (only in loanwords)

Examples:
- **bêst** (best) [beːst]
- **hûs** (house) [huːs]
- **grien** (green) [ɡriən]
- **skoalle** (school) [skoələ]
- **tsjil** (wheel) [tsjɪl]

## Grammar

### Nouns

Frisian nouns have two genders: common and neuter. They also inflect for number (singular and plural).

Gender is not always predictable, but there are some patterns:

- Most nouns ending in -e are common gender
- Most nouns ending in -ing are common gender
- Most nouns referring to people or animals have natural gender

Examples:
- Common: **de man** (the man), **de frou** (the woman), **de auto** (the car)
- Neuter: **it hûs** (the house), **it bern** (the child), **it boek** (the book)

Plural formation:
1. Add -en: **hûs** (house) → **hûzen** (houses)
2. Add -s: **auto** (car) → **auto's** (cars)
3. Change vowel: **man** (man) → **manlju** (men)
4. Irregular: **bern** (child) → **bern** (children)

### Articles

Frisian has both definite and indefinite articles:

- Definite: **de** (common), **it** (neuter)
- Indefinite: **in** (for both genders)

Examples:
- **de man** (the man)
- **it hûs** (the house)
- **in boek** (a book)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Frisian agree with the noun they modify in gender and number. The basic rules are:

1. Attributive adjectives (before nouns):
   - Add -e for common gender nouns: **de griene auto** (the green car)
   - No ending for singular neuter nouns: **it grien hûs** (the green house)
   - Add -e for plural nouns of both genders: **de griene auto's**, **de griene huzen**

2. Predicative adjectives (after linking verbs):
   - No ending: **De auto is grien** (The car is green)

Comparative and superlative forms:
- Comparative: add -er: **grien** → **griener** (greener)
- Superlative: add -st: **grien** → **grienst** (greenest)

Irregular forms exist for some common adjectives:
- **goed** (good) → **better** (better) → **bêst** (best)
- **grut** (big) → **grutter** (bigger) → **grutst** (biggest)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Subject | Object | Possessive |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| 1sg | **ik** | **my** | **myn** |
| 2sg informal | **do** | **dy** | **dyn** |
| 2sg formal | **jo** | **jo** | **jo** |
| 3sg masc | **hy** | **him** | **syn** |
| 3sg fem | **sy** | **har** | **har** |
| 3sg neut | **it** | **it** | **syn** |
| 1pl | **wy** | **ús** | **ús** |
| 2pl | **jimme** | **jimme** | **jimme** |
| 3pl | **sy** | **har** | **har** |

Examples:
- **Ik sjoch him** (I see him)
- **Sy jout it oan har** (She gives it to her)
- **Us hûs is grut** (Our house is big)

Demonstrative pronouns:
- **dizze** (this, common), **dit** (this, neuter)
- **dy** (that, common), **dat** (that, neuter)

Relative pronouns:
- **dy't** (who, which, that) for common gender
- **dat** (which, that) for neuter gender

Example: **De man dy't dêr stiet** (The man who stands there)

### Verbs

Frisian verbs conjugate for person, number, tense, and mood. The infinitive typically ends in -e or -je.

Present tense conjugation of **nimme** (to take):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **nim** | **nimme** |
| 2 | **nimst** | **nimme** |
| 3 | **nimt** | **nimme** |

Past tense is formed by adding -te or -de to the stem for weak verbs:
- **wurkje** (to work) → **wurke** (worked)
- **libje** (to live) → **libde** (lived)

Strong verbs change their stem vowel:
- **nimme** (to take) → **naam** (took)
- **sjonge** (to sing) → **song** (sang)

Perfect tense is formed with **hawwe** (to have) or **wêze** (to be) + past participle:
- **Ik haw wurke** (I have worked)
- **Hy is kommen** (He has come)

Future tense uses **sille** (shall) + infinitive:
- **Ik sil komme** (I will come)

Conditional mood uses **soe** (would) + infinitive:
- **Ik soe komme** (I would come)

Imperative is formed by using the verb stem:
- **Kom hjir!** (Come here!)

### Word Order

Frisian generally follows the V2 (verb-second) word order in main clauses, similar to Dutch and German:

1. Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) in simple declarative sentences:
   **Ik sjoch de hûn** (I see the dog)

2. Verb-first in questions and commands:
   **Sjochst do de hûn?** (Do you see the dog?)
   **Sjoch de hûn!** (Look at the dog!)

3. Time expressions often come at the beginning, pushing the subject after the verb:
   **Juster seach ik de hûn** (Yesterday I saw the dog)

In subordinate clauses, the verb typically moves to the end:
**Ik wit dat hy de hûn sjocht** (I know that he sees the dog)

### Prepositions

Frisian has many prepositions, often corresponding to those in English and Dutch:

- **yn** (in)
- **op** (on)

### Conjunctions

Common conjunctions include:

- **en** (and)
- **mar** (but)
- **of** (or)
- **want** (because)
- **dat** (that)
- **as** (if, when)

Example: **Ik wol komme, mar ik kin net** (I want to come, but I can't)

## Vocabulary

## Dialectal Variation

While this overview focuses on Standard Frisian (based on the dialect of the Greidhoeke region), there are several dialects within West Frisian. Some of the main dialect groups include:

1. Klaaifrysk (Clay Frisian): Spoken in the northwestern part of Friesland
2. Wâldfrysk (Forest Frisian): Spoken in the eastern part of Friesland
3. Súdwesthoeksk: Spoken in the southwestern part of Friesland

These dialects differ in pronunciation, vocabulary, and sometimes grammar. For example:

- Standard Frisian: **bûter** (butter)
  Klaaifrysk: **bútter**
  Wâldfrysk: **boetr**

- Standard Frisian: **ik ha west** (I have been)
  Súdwesthoeksk: **ik bin west**

## Verb Prefixes

Frisian, like Dutch and German, uses separable and inseparable verb prefixes to modify the meaning of verbs. These prefixes can significantly change the meaning of the base verb.

Separable prefixes:
- **oan-**: on, at
- **ôf-**: off
- **út-**: out
- **mei-**: with
- **troch-**: through

Example with **oankomme** (to arrive):
**Hy komt moarn oan** (He arrives tomorrow)

Inseparable prefixes:
- **be-**: often makes verbs transitive
- **fer-**: changes state or intensifies action
- **ûnt-**: reverses action or removes something

Example with **ferkeare** (to be in a state):
**It ferkeare yn in minne tastân** (It was in a bad state)

## Diminutives

Frisian uses diminutives extensively, not only to indicate small size but also to express affection or to soften the meaning. The most common diminutive suffix is **-ke**, but there are variations depending on the ending of the noun:

- **hûs** (house) → **hûske** (small house)
- **famke** (girl) → **famkje** (little girl)
- **man** (man) → **mantsje** (little man)
- **beam** (tree) → **beamke** (small tree)

## Compound Words

Like other Germanic languages, Frisian can form long compound words by combining nouns, adjectives, and verbs. The last word determines the gender and grammatical function of the compound:

- **skoalle** (school) + **boek** (book) = **skoalleboek** (schoolbook)
- **bern** (child) + **wein** (wagon) = **bernewein** (stroller)
- **sutelje** (to peddle) + **man** (man) = **sutelman** (peddler)

## Syntax

### Subordinate Clauses

Subordinate clauses in Frisian typically use a different word order, with the finite verb moving to the end of the clause:

Main clause: **Ik wit dat** (I know that)
Subordinate clause: **...hy moarn komt** (...he comes tomorrow)
Full sentence: **Ik wit dat hy moarn komt** (I know that he comes tomorrow)

Common subordinating conjunctions include:
- **dat** (that)
- **oft** (if, whether)
- **om't** (because)
- **wylst** (while)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by relative pronouns:
- **dy't** for common gender
- **dat** for neuter gender

Example:
**De man dy't dêr stiet, is myn heit** (The man who stands there is my father)
**It hûs dat wy kocht hawwe, is âld** (The house that we bought is old)

### Comparative Constructions

Comparatives are formed using **as** (as, than):
- **Hy is grutter as ik** (He is taller than me)
- **It is like djoer as earder** (It's as expensive as before)

Superlatives use the definite article:
- **Hy is de grutste fan 'e klasse** (He is the tallest in the class)

## Negation

Negation in Frisian is typically expressed using **net** (not):
- **Ik kom net** (I'm not coming)
- **Hy hat it net dien** (He hasn't done it)

Double negatives are not used in standard Frisian:
- **Ik ha nimmen sjoen** (I saw nobody) - literally: "I have nobody seen"

## Question Formation

Yes/no questions are formed by inverting the subject and verb:
- Statement: **Do komst moarn** (You're coming tomorrow)
- Question: **Komst do moarn?** (Are you coming tomorrow?)

Wh-questions use interrogative words at the beginning of the sentence:
- **Wa** (who): **Wa komt moarn?** (Who is coming tomorrow?)
- **Wat** (what): **Wat dochst do?** (What are you doing?)
- **Wêr** (where): **Wêr wennet hy?** (Where does he live?)
- **Wannear** (when): **Wannear begjint it?** (When does it start?)
- **Hoe** (how): **Hoe giet it?** (How are you?)

## Passive Voice

The passive voice is formed using the auxiliary verb **wurde** (to become) plus the past participle:
- Active: **De man keapet it hûs** (The man buys the house)
- Passive: **It hûs wurdt troch de man kocht** (The house is bought by the man)

## Modal Verbs

Frisian has several modal verbs that are used with infinitives to express ability, possibility, permission, etc.:
- **kinne** (can, to be able to)
- **meie** (may, to be allowed to)
- **moatte** (must, to have to)
- **wolle** (want to)
- **sille** (shall, will)

Example:
**Ik kin swimme** (I can swim)
**Wy moatte gau gean** (We must go quickly)

## Reflexive Verbs

Many Frisian verbs are used reflexively, often with a different meaning than their non-reflexive counterparts:
- **waskje** (to wash) → **him waskje** (to wash oneself)
- **skeare** (to shave) → **him skeare** (to shave oneself)

Reflexive pronouns:
- **my** (myself)
- **dy** (yourself, informal)
- **jo** (yourself, formal)
- **him** (himself)
- **har** (herself)
- **ús** (ourselves)
- **jim** (yourselves)
- **har** (themselves)

Example:
**Ik waskje my** (I wash myself)

In conclusion, Frisian is a rich and complex language with many interesting features. Its close relationship to English and Dutch, combined with its unique characteristics, make it a fascinating subject for language enthusiasts and learners alike.
