# Lojban

Lojban is an artificial language created by the Logical Language Group in 1987. It is designed to be culturally neutral, logically structured, and unambiguous. The name "Lojban" is derived from the Lojban words **logji** (logic) and **bangu** (language).

## Phonology and Orthography

Lojban uses 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, excluding 'q' and 'w'. Each letter corresponds to a single phoneme, making the language phonetically regular.

### Diphthongs

Lojban has four falling diphthongs:

- **ai** [aj]
- **ei** [ɛj]
- **oi** [oj]
- **au** [aw]

### Stress

Stress in Lojban is regular and predictable. In words with more than one syllable, stress falls on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable. For example:

- **bridi** ['bri.di] (predicate)
- **klama** ['kla.ma] (come)
- **fenki** ['fɛn.ki] (crazy)

### Phonotactics

Lojban has strict rules for syllable structure:

1. A syllable must contain one vowel or diphthong.
2. A consonant cluster can have at most two consonants.
3. Words must end in a vowel.

Examples of valid Lojban words:

- **lo** [lo] (the)
- **broda** ['bro.da] (predicate variable)
- **spuda** ['spu.da] (reply)

## Morphology

Lojban morphology is highly regular and based on a system of root words (gismu) and compound words (lujvo).

### Gismu (Root Words)

Gismu are the basic building blocks of Lojban vocabulary. They always have five letters in a CVCCV or CCVCV pattern. Examples:

- **klama** (come)
- **bridi** (predicate)
- **ciska** (write)

### Lujvo (Compound Words)

Lujvo are created by combining two or more gismu. The process involves dropping vowels and applying specific combination rules. For example:

- **gerku** (dog) + **zdani** (house) = **gerzda** (kennel)
- **panzi** (offspring) + **patfu** (father) = **panpau** (stepfather)

### Cmavo (Structure Words)

Cmavo are short words (usually one or two syllables) that serve grammatical functions. They include articles, conjunctions, and various particles. Examples:

- **lo** (the)
- **e** (and)
- **ku** (end of description)

### Rafsi (Affix Forms)

Rafsi are short forms of gismu used in creating lujvo. Each gismu has one or more rafsi. For example:

- **klama** has rafsi: **kla**, **kam**
- **bridi** has rafsi: **bri**

## Grammar

Lojban grammar is based on predicate logic and uses a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order by default, though other orders are possible due to its case system.

### Basic Sentence Structure

A basic Lojban sentence (bridi) consists of one predicate and one or more arguments. The predicate describes a relationship between the arguments. For example:

**mi klama lo zarci**
I go-to the market
"I go to the market"

Here, **klama** is the predicate, **mi** is the first argument (the one going), and **lo zarci** is the second argument (the destination).

### Selbri (Predicate)

The selbri is the central concept of a Lojban sentence, expressing a relationship between arguments. It can be a gismu, lujvo, or a more complex structure. For example:

**mi nelci lo gerku**
I like the dog
"I like the dog"

Here, **nelci** is the selbri, expressing the relationship of liking between **mi** (I) and **lo gerku** (the dog).

### Sumti (Arguments)

Sumti are the arguments of a predicate. They can be simple pronouns, descriptions, or more complex structures. Examples:

- **mi** (I/me)
- **lo prenu** (the person)
- **le melbi nixli** (the beautiful girl)

### Description Sumti

Descriptions in Lojban start with an article (**lo**, **le**, **la**) and end with the elidable terminator **ku**. For example:

**lo prenu [ku] cu klama**
The person comes
"The person comes"

### Tenses and Aspects

Lojban uses a system of tense and aspect markers called BAI. These are placed before the selbri. For example:

**mi pu klama lo zarci**
I past go-to the market
"I went to the market"

**mi ca'o tavla**
I [present continuous] talk
"I am talking"

### Questions

Questions in Lojban are formed using question words or by placing **xu** at the beginning of a statement. For example:

**ma klama lo zarci**
Who goes-to the market?
"Who goes to the market?"

**xu do nelci lo gerku**
[yes/no] you like the dog
"Do you like the dog?"

### Negation

Negation in Lojban is typically done using **na** before the selbri:

**mi na nelci lo gerku**
I not like the dog
"I don't like the dog"

### Logical Connectives

Lojban has a sophisticated system of logical connectives for joining phrases and sentences. For example:

**mi nelci lo gerku .e lo mlatu**
I like the dog and the cat
"I like the dog and the cat"

**mi nelci lo gerku .a lo mlatu**
I like the dog or the cat
"I like the dog or the cat (or both)"

### Attitudinals

Lojban uses cmavo called attitudinals to express emotions and attitudes. These can be placed anywhere in a sentence. For example:

**mi .ui klama lo zarci**
I [happiness] go-to the market
"I happily go to the market"

### Quotations

Lojban has a system for quoting text in other languages or Lojban itself:

**mi cusku lu mi prami do li'u**
I express ["I love you"]
"I say 'I love you'"

### Numbers and Quantifiers

Lojban has a base-10 number system and various quantifiers:

- **pa** (1), **re** (2), **ci** (3), etc.
- **no** (0), **so'a** (almost all), **ro** (each/all)

Example:

**mi ponse re gerku**
I possess two dogs
"I have two dogs"

### Abstractions

Lojban can form abstract concepts using specific cmavo:

**lo nu mi klama cu pluka**
The event-of (I go) is-pleasant
"Going is pleasant"

**lo ka melbi cu xamgu**
The quality-of being-beautiful is-good
"Beauty is good"

## Vocabulary

Lojban vocabulary is designed to be culturally neutral, with roots drawn from the world's major languages based on a weighted average of speakers.

### Color Terms

Lojban has a system of color gismu that can be combined to describe specific shades:

- **xunre** (red)
- **blanu** (blue)
- **pelxu** (yellow)
- **narju** (orange)

Example:
**ti xunre blanu skari**
This (is) red-blue color
"This is purple"

### Kinship Terms

- **rirni** (parent)
- **panzi** (offspring)
- **bruna** (sibling)

### Time and Calendar

Lojban has a unique calendar system based on the Gregorian calendar:

- **detri** (date)
- **djedi** (full day)
- **masti** (month)
- **nanca** (year)

Example:
**mi jbena fi li paremoi pi'e ci pi'e pasoxaso**
I am-born on the 12th of-the 3rd of-the 1980
"I was born on March 12, 1980"

### Lojban-Specific Concepts

Lojban has several words for concepts specific to the language:

- **valsi** (word)
- **gismu** (root word)
- **lujvo** (compound word)
- **cmavo** (structure word)
- **bridi** (predicate relationship)

## Discourse and Pragmatics

### Discourse Structure

Lojban uses various cmavo to structure discourse:

- **to** ... **toi** for parenthetical remarks
- **ni'o** for new topics
- **no'i** for new paragraphs within the same topic

Example:
**mi klama lo zarci .i to ku'i mi na djica toi .i mi bilga**
I go-to the market. (But I not want). I am-obliged.
"I go to the market. (However, I don't want to.) I have to."

### Evidentials

Lojban has a system of evidentials to indicate the source or reliability of information:

- **ba'a** (I expect)
- **ca'e** (I define)
- **ka'u** (I know by cultural means)
- **se'o** (I know by internal experience)

Example:
**ba'a do klama lo zarci**
[I-expect] you go-to the market
"I expect you're going to the market"

### Modality

Lojban expresses modality through various cmavo:

- **ka'e** (can, is able to)
- **nu'o** (can but has not)
- **pu'i** (can and has)

Example:
**mi ka'e limna**
I can swim
"I can swim"

### Emphasis and Focus

Lojban can emphasize or focus on different parts of a sentence through word order and specific cmavo:

**lo gerku cu klama**
The dog comes
"The dog comes"

**klama fa lo gerku**
Comes [focus] the dog
"It's the dog that comes"

### Metalinguistic Features

Lojban has specific constructs for discussing language itself:

**zo gerku cmene lo'e gerku**
The-word "gerku" is-the-name-of the-typical dog
"The word 'gerku' means 'dog'"

## Writing System

Lojban is typically written using the Latin alphabet, but it can be written in any script that can represent its phonemes. There have been experiments with other writing systems, including:

### Zbalermorna

Zbalermorna is a featural alphabet designed specifically for Lojban. It represents each phoneme with a unique symbol, making it possible to write Lojban unambiguously.

### Lojban in Tengwar

Some Lojban enthusiasts have adapted Tolkien's Tengwar script for writing Lojban, assigning specific Tengwar characters to Lojban phonemes.

### Lojban in Loglan-based Script

A script based on the one used for Loglan (Lojban's predecessor) has also been proposed, using geometric shapes to represent different types of words (gismu, cmavo, etc.).

In conclusion, Lojban is a highly regular and logical constructed language with a unique approach to grammar and vocabulary. Its design aims to eliminate ambiguity and provide a clear, precise means of communication based on predicate logic.
