## Morphology

### Nouns

Wolof nouns are classified into several noun classes, similar to grammatical gender in some languages. Each noun class is associated with a specific consonant, which appears in determiners and other elements that agree with the noun.

The main noun classes in Wolof are:

1. K-class (things)
2. B-class (large things)
3. G-class (trees, plants)
4. J-class (small things)
5. M-class (liquids, masses)
6. S-class (thin, long objects)
7. W-class (various)
8. L-class (various)

Examples:

- **kër gi** (the house) - G-class
- **xale bi** (the child) - B-class
- **ndox mi** (the water) - M-class
- **sabar si** (the drum) - S-class
- **wax wi** (the talk) - W-class
- **loxo li** (the hand) - L-class

Plural forms are typically formed by changing the class marker:

- **kër yi** (the houses)
- **xale yi** (the children)
- **ndox yi** (the waters)
- **sabar yi** (the drums)

Some nouns have irregular plurals:

- **góor gi** (the man) → **góor ñi** (the men)
- **jigéen ji** (the woman) → **jigéen ñi** (the women)
- **nit ki** (the person) → **nit ñi** (the people)

### Determiners

Determiners in Wolof agree with the noun class and come after the noun. The definite article has two forms: proximal (near) and distal (far).

Examples:

- **xale bi** (the child - near)
- **xale ba** (the child - far)
- **kër gi** (the house - near)
- **kër ga** (the house - far)
- **ndox mi** (the water - near)
- **ndox ma** (the water - far)

The indefinite article is **a** and comes before the noun:

- **a xale** (a child)
- **a kër** (a house)
- **a ndox** (a water)

Demonstratives also agree with the noun class:

- **xale bii** (this child)
- **xale boobu** (that child)
- **kër gii** (this house)
- **kër googu** (that house)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Wolof:

|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **man** | **nun** |
| 2nd | **yow** | **yéen** |

Subject pronouns are often omitted as the verb conjugation includes person markers.

Object pronouns are placed after the verb:

**Gis naa ko.** (I saw him/her/it.)

- **këram** (his/her house)
- **sunu xale** (our child)
- **seen kër** (your (pl.) house)

- **seen bopp** (yourselves/themselves)

Example: **Gis na boppam ci seetu bi.** (He saw himself in the mirror.)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Wolof typically come after the noun and agree with the noun class:

**xale bu ndaw** (small child)
**kër gu mag** (big house)

- **bon** (bad)
- **xonq** (red)
- **ñuul** (black)

**Kër gii moo gëna mag ci dëkk bi.** (This house is the biggest in the town.)

### Verbs

Wolof verbs are not inflected for person or number. Instead, they use a complex system of focus markers and aspect markers.

#### Focus

Wolof has a unique focus system that emphasizes different parts of the sentence. There are several focus markers:

1. Subject focus (a naa):
**Xale bi a ngi lekk.** (It's the child who is eating.)
**Man a dem.** (It's I who went.)

2. Verb focus (dafa):
**Xale bi dafa lekk.** (The child is EATING.)
**Dafa tàng.** (It is HOT.)

3. Object focus (la):
**Ceeb la xale bi lekk.** (It's rice that the child ate.)
**Kër gi la jënd.** (It's the house that he bought.)

4. Presentative focus (a ngi):
**Xale bi a ngi lekk.** (Here's the child eating.)
**Jigéen ji a ngi ñëw.** (Here comes the woman.)

5. Neutral/narrative (na):
**Xale bi lekk na.** (The child ate.)
**Dem na.** (He/She went.)

#### Aspect

Wolof uses various markers to indicate aspect:

1. Progressive: -y
**Maa ngi lekkee.** (I am eating.)
**Mu ngi binda.** (He/She is writing.)

2. Habitual: -oon
**Damay lekkoon ceeb.** (I used to eat rice.)
**Dañuy jàngoon wolof.** (They used to study Wolof.)

3. Perfect: -oon na
**Lekk naa woon.** (I had eaten.)
**Dem na woon.** (He/She had gone.)

#### Negation

Negation is typically formed by adding **-ul** to the verb:

**Lekku ma.** (I didn't eat.)
**Déggul.** (He/She didn't hear.)

In some focus constructions, **du** is used for negation:

**Du moom mi dem.** (It's not him/her who went.)
**Du tey lañuy dem.** (It's not today that we're going.)

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed by using the bare verb stem:

**Lekk!** (Eat!)
**Dem!** (Go!)

For plural or polite imperatives, add **-leen**:

**Lekkleen!** (Eat! - plural/polite)
**Demleen!** (Go! - plural/polite)

#### Causative

Causative verbs are formed by adding the suffix **-al** or **-le** to the verb stem:

**lekk** (to eat) → **lekkal** (to feed)
**jàng** (to study) → **jàngle** (to teach)

Example: **Jàngle naa xale yi wolof.** (I taught the children Wolof.)

#### Reciprocal

Reciprocal actions are expressed by adding **-ante** to the verb stem:

**gis** (to see) → **gisante** (to see each other)
**waar** (to kill) → **waarante** (to kill each other)

Example: **Dañu gisante démb.** (They saw each other yesterday.)

### Numerals

Wolof numerals 1-10:

1. **benn**
2. **ñaar**
3. **ñett**
4. **ñeent**
5. **juróom**
6. **juróom benn**
7. **juróom ñaar**
8. **juróom ñett**
9. **juróom ñeent**
10. **fukk**

Numbers 11-19 are formed by adding **ak** (and) to **fukk**:

11. **fukk ak benn**
12. **fukk ak ñaar**
13. **fukk ak ñett**

Multiples of ten:

20. **ñaar fukk**
30. **ñett fukk**
40. **ñeent fukk**
50. **juróom fukk**

100 is **téeméer**, 1000 is **junni**.

Examples:
**Am naa ñett téeméer ak juróom fukk ak juróom ñaar dërëm.** (I have 357 CFA francs.)
**Ñaar junni ak juróom benn téeméer at** (2600 years)

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Wolof is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), but this can vary depending on the focus construction used:

SOV: **Xale bi ceeb lekk na.** (The child rice ate.)
SVO: **Xale bi dafa lekk ceeb.** (The child ATE rice.)

In questions and some subordinate clauses, the word order can change:

**Lan la xale bi lekk?** (What did the child eat?) - OSV

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding **ndax** at the beginning of a statement:

**Ndax lekk nga?** (Did you eat?)
**Ndax dem nga ca lekkool ba?** (Did you go to school?)

Wh-questions use interrogative words such as:

- **lan** (what)
- **kan** (who)
- **fan** (where)
- **kañ** (when)
- **naka** (how)
- **ñaata** (how many)

These typically come at the beginning of the sentence:

**Lan nga lekk?** (What did you eat?)
**Kan moo dem?** (Who went?)
**Fan la sa kër nekk?** (Where is your house?)
**Kañ ngay ñëw?** (When are you coming?)
**Naka nga def?** (How are you?)
**Ñaata at nga am?** (How old are you? Lit: How many years do you have?)

### Negation

As mentioned earlier, negation is typically formed by adding **-ul** to the verb:

**Demul.** (He/She didn't go.)
**Xamu ma ko.** (I don't know him/her.)

In some focus constructions, **du** is used for negation:

**Du moom mi dem.** (It's not him/her who went.)
**Du tey lañuy lekk ceeb.** (It's not today that we're eating rice.)

Double negation is possible and common in Wolof:

**Duma dem fenn.** (I'm not going anywhere. Lit: I'm not going nowhere.)

### Conjunctions

Common conjunctions in Wolof include:

- **ak** (and): **Omar ak Fatou** (Omar and Fatou)
- **walla** (or): **Ndox walla meew?** (Water or milk?)
- **waaye** (but): **Dama ko bëgg, waaye dafa jafe.** (I like it, but it's difficult.)

Example:
**Dama bëgg ceeb ak yapp, waaye xolu ma ndax dafa cher.** (I like rice and meat, but I hesitate because it's expensive.)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Wolof are introduced by the relative pronoun **bu** (which agrees with the noun class of the antecedent) and come after the noun they modify:

**Xale bu jàng bi** (The child who studies)
**Kër gu mag gi** (The big house)
**Ndox mu set mi** (The clean water)

Examples in sentences:
**Xale bu jàng bi moo am njàng.** (The child who studies is the one who has knowledge.)
**Gis naa kër gu mag gi nga wax woon.** (I saw the big house you had talked about.)

### Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences in Wolof typically use **bu** (if) or **su** (if):

**Bu tëy, dinaa dem.** (If it's possible, I will go.)
**Su ma amoon xaalis, dinaa jënd kër.** (If I had money, I would buy a house.)

### Serial Verb Constructions

Wolof uses serial verb constructions, where two or more verbs are used in sequence without conjunctions:

**Dama dem jënd mburu.** (I went to buy bread. Lit: I went bought bread.)
**Xale bi dafa tëb daanu.** (The child jumped and fell. Lit: The child jumped fell.)

## Lexicon

Wolof has borrowed words from various languages due to historical and cultural influences:

1. Arabic (due to Islamic influence):
   **alxames** (Thursday) from Arabic "al-khamis"
   **juma** (Friday) from Arabic "jumu'ah"
   **adduna** (world) from Arabic "ad-dunya"

2. French (due to colonial history):
   **lekol** (school) from French "l'école"
   **taabal** (table) from French "table"
   **sigarett** (cigarette) from French "cigarette"

3. English (modern influence):
   **kompyutar** (computer)
   **tëlefoñ** (telephone)
   **fureeto** (freezer)

4. Portuguese (early European contact):
   **palanteer** (window) from Portuguese "janela"
   **kawas** (calabash) from Portuguese "cabaça"

Wolof also has many idiomatic expressions:

**Nit ku baax** (lit. "person who is good") - a kind person
**Bul tëdd ci gaal gu dul sa gaal** (lit. "Don't lie in a boat that's not your boat") - Don't meddle in others' affairs
**Ku am nit, am na alal** (lit. "Who has people, has wealth") - Relationships are more valuable than material wealth
**Bëgg bëgg du tax a mën** (lit. "Wanting doesn't mean being able") - Desire doesn't equal ability

## Dialects

While Wolof is relatively uniform across its speaking area, there are some dialectal variations:

1. Dakar-Wolof: The prestige dialect spoken in the capital. It incorporates more French loanwords and is considered the standard form.

2. Baol: Spoken in central Senegal, particularly in the regions of Diourbel and Kaolack.

3. Cayor: Northern dialect, spoken in the regions of Thiès and Louga.

4. Jolof: Northeastern dialect, spoken in the Saint-Louis region.

5. Lebou: Coastal dialect spoken by the Lebou people, particularly around Dakar.

Differences are mainly in vocabulary and some phonological features, but mutual intelligibility is high. For example:

- "How are you?": 
  Dakar-Wolof: **Na nga def?**
  Baol: **No mu deme?**

- "I'm fine":
  Dakar-Wolof: **Maa ngi fi rekk**
  Cayor: **Jàmm rekk**

## Writing System

Wolof uses a modified Latin alphabet:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N Ñ NG O P Q R S T U W X Y

The letter 'ñ' represents the palatal nasal [ɲ], while 'ng' represents the velar nasal [ŋ].

Accents are sometimes used to distinguish vowel quality:

- é [ɛ] vs. e [e]
- ó [ɔ] vs. o [o]

However, these accents are often omitted in everyday writing.

In addition to the Latin script, there have been efforts to use the Arabic script (Wolofal) for writing Wolof, particularly in religious contexts. This system is still used by some, especially in Quranic schools.

## Sample Texts

Here are a few sample texts in Wolof with English translations:

1. **Bépp doom Aadama juddu na, am sañ-sañ te yem ci tawfeex ak sago. Nekk na it ku xam dëgg te ànd ak xelam, te war na jëflante ak nawleen, te teg ko ci wàllu mbokk.**

(All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.)

2. **Asalaamaalekum! Maa ngi tudd Ousmane. Dama nekk Senegaalees te dama dëkk Ndakaaru. Dama bëgg jàng làkk yi, rawatina wolof. Wolof mooy sama làkk ndey. Su ma demee benn réew, damay jéema wax wolof ak waa réew ma.**

(Peace be upon you! My name is Ousmane. I am Senegalese and I live in Dakar. I like learning languages, especially Wolof. Wolof is my mother tongue. When I go to another country, I try to speak Wolof with the people of that country.)

3. **Bés bu nekk, Kumba dafay jóg ci suba teel, taal safara, togg qeej ngir njaboot gi. Bu nopee ak liggeey bi, mu sëlmëx, sol yërëm yu rafet, dem ca màrse ba. Foofa, dafay jënd dugub, jën, ak xorom ngir togg reer bi.**

(Every day, Kumba wakes up early in the morning, lights the fire, and cooks breakfast for the family. When she's done with the work, she freshens up, puts on beautiful clothes, and goes to the market. There, she buys millet, fish, and salt to cook dinner.)

These texts demonstrate various aspects of Wolof grammar, including the use of focus markers, verb conjugations, noun classes, and common vocabulary.
