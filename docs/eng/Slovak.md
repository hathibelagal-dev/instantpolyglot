# Slovak

Slovak (slovenčina) is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in Slovakia by about 5 million people. It is closely related to Czech and Polish, and more distantly to other Slavic languages. Slovak uses the Latin alphabet with diacritics.

## Phonology and Orthography

Slovak has a largely phonemic orthography, meaning that each letter generally corresponds to one sound. However, there are some exceptions and assimilation rules.

### Vowels

Slovak has 14 vowel phonemes:

| Short vowels | Long vowels | Diphthongs |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| a [a] | á [aː] | ia [ɪ̯a] |
| e [ɛ] | é [ɛː] | ie [ɪ̯ɛ] |
| i [i] | í [iː] | iu [ɪ̯u] |
| o [ɔ] | ó [ɔː] | ô [u̯ɔ] |
| u [u] | ú [uː] | |
| y [i] | ý [iː] | |

Note that "y" and "ý" represent the same sounds as "i" and "í" respectively, but are used in different contexts due to historical reasons.

Examples:
- **mat'** [mac] (mother)
- **máme** [maːmɛ] (we have)
- **biely** [bɪ̯ɛli] (white)
- **môj** [mu̯ɔj] (my)

### Consonants

Slovak has the following consonant phonemes:

| Consonant | IPA | Example |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| b | [b] | **brat** [brat] (brother) |
| c | [ts] | **cena** [tsɛna] (price) |
| č | [tʃ] | **čas** [tʃas] (time) |
| d | [d] | **dom** [dɔm] (house) |
| ď | [ɟ] | **ďakujem** [ɟakujɛm] (thank you) |
| dz | [dz] | **medzi** [mɛdzi] (between) |
| dž | [dʒ] | **džem** [dʒɛm] (jam) |
| f | [f] | **farba** [farba] (color) |
| g | [ɡ] | **guma** [ɡuma] (eraser) |
| h | [ɦ] | **hlas** [ɦlas] (voice) |
| ch | [x] | **chlieb** [xlɪ̯ɛp] (bread) |
| j | [j] | **jas** [jas] (brightness) |
| k | [k] | **koza** [kɔza] (goat) |
| l | [l] | **leto** [lɛtɔ] (summer) |
| ĺ | [lː] | **stĺp** [stlːp] (column) |
| m | [m] | **mama** [mama] (mom) |
| n | [n] | **nos** [nɔs] (nose) |
| ň | [ɲ] | **kôň** [kɔːɲ] (horse) |
| p | [p] | **pero** [pɛrɔ] (pen) |
| r | [r] | **ruka** [ruka] (hand) |
| ŕ | [rː] | **vŕba** [vrːba] (willow) |
| s | [s] | **sen** [sɛn] (dream) |
| š | [ʃ] | **šaty** [ʃati] (dress) |
| t | [t] | **telo** [tɛlɔ] (body) |
| ť | [c] | **ťava** [cava] (camel) |
| v | [v] | **voda** [vɔda] (water) |
| z | [z] | **zima** [zima] (winter) |
| ž | [ʒ] | **život** [ʒivɔt] (life) |

### Pronunciation Rules

1. Voice assimilation: Voiced consonants become voiceless before voiceless consonants and at the end of words.
   Example: **z kramov** [s kramɔf] (from shops)

2. The letter "v" is pronounced [u̯] at the end of syllables:
   **pravda** [prau̯da] (truth)

3. Syllabic consonants: "r" and "l" can form syllable nuclei:
   **vlk** [vlk] (wolf), **krk** [krk] (neck)

4. Stress is always on the first syllable of a word:
   **'jablko** (apple), **'slovenčina** (Slovak language)

## Morphology

Slovak is a highly inflected language with complex morphology for nouns, adjectives, and verbs.

### Nouns

Nouns in Slovak have three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural), and six cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental).

Example declension of **muž** (man, masculine animate):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | muž | muži |
| Accusative | muža | mužov |
| Genitive | muža | mužov |
| Dative | mužovi | mužom |
| Locative | mužovi | mužoch |
| Instrumental | mužom | mužmi |

Example declension of **žena** (woman, feminine):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | žena | ženy |
| Accusative | ženu | ženy |
| Genitive | ženy | žien |
| Dative | žene | ženám |
| Locative | žene | ženách |
| Instrumental | ženou | ženami |

Example declension of **mesto** (city, neuter):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | mesto | mestá |
| Accusative | mesto | mestá |
| Genitive | mesta | miest |
| Dative | mestu | mestám |
| Locative | meste | mestách |
| Instrumental | mestom | mestami |

### Adjectives

Adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case. They typically precede the noun.

Example declension of **dobrý** (good):

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nom. Sg. | dobrý | dobrá | dobré |
| Acc. Sg. | dobrého (anim.) / dobrý (inan.) | dobrú | dobré |
| Gen. Sg. | dobrého | dobrej | dobrého |
| Dat. Sg. | dobrému | dobrej | dobrému |
| Loc. Sg. | dobrom | dobrej | dobrom |
| Ins. Sg. | dobrým | dobrou | dobrým |
| Nom. Pl. | dobrí (anim.) / dobré (inan.) | dobré | dobré |

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Nominative | Accusative | Genitive |
|--------|------------|------------|----------|
| 1st Sg. | ja | ma / mňa | mňa |
| 2nd Sg. | ty | ťa / teba | teba |
| 3rd Sg. M | on | ho / jeho | jeho |
| 3rd Sg. F | ona | ju / ňu | jej |
| 3rd Sg. N | ono | ho / jeho | jeho |
| 1st Pl. | my | nás | nás |
| 2nd Pl. | vy | vás | vás |
| 3rd Pl. | oni / ony | ich | ich |

Demonstrative pronouns:
- **ten** (that, masculine)
- **tá** (that, feminine)
- **to** (that, neuter)
- **tento** (this, masculine)
- **táto** (this, feminine)
- **toto** (this, neuter)

### Verbs

Slovak verbs are conjugated for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood. They also have participles and verbal nouns.

Present tense conjugation of **písať** (to write):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | píšem | píšeme |
| 2nd | píšeš | píšete |
| 3rd | píše | píšu |

Past tense is formed using the l-participle and present tense forms of **byť** (to be):

- **Písal som** (I wrote, masculine)
- **Písala som** (I wrote, feminine)
- **Písali sme** (We wrote)

Future tense for imperfective verbs is formed with the future forms of **byť** and the infinitive:

- **Budem písať** (I will write)
- **Budeme písať** (We will write)

Perfective verbs use their present tense forms to express future meaning:

- **Napíšem** (I will write [and finish])

Verbal aspect is a crucial feature of Slovak verbs. Most verbs come in aspectual pairs:

- Imperfective: **písať** (to write, ongoing action)
- Perfective: **napísať** (to write, completed action)

Imperative mood:

- 2nd person singular: **píš**
- 1st person plural: **píšme**
- 2nd person plural: **píšte**

Conditional mood is formed with the particle **by** and the l-participle:

- **Písal by som** (I would write, masculine)
- **Písala by som** (I would write, feminine)

## Syntax

Slovak has a relatively flexible word order due to its case system, but the default order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).

1. Basic sentence structure:
   **Ján číta knihu.** (John reads a book.)

2. Questions can be formed by intonation or using question words:
   **Číta Ján knihu?** (Is John reading a book?)
   **Čo číta Ján?** (What is John reading?)

3. Negation is formed by adding **ne-** to the verb:
   **Ján nečíta knihu.** (John is not reading a book.)

4. Reflexive verbs use **sa** or **si**:
   **Umývam sa.** (I wash myself.)
   **Myslím si, že...** (I think that...)

5. Subordinate clauses often use the conjunction **že** (that):
   **Myslím, že prší.** (I think that it's raining.)

6. Relative clauses use **ktorý/á/é** (which, who):
   **Muž, ktorý prišiel včera...** (The man who came yesterday...)

7. Conditional sentences use **keby** (if):
   **Keby som mal čas, išiel by som.** (If I had time, I would go.)

## Lexicon

Slovak vocabulary is primarily Slavic in origin, with loanwords from various languages:

1. Czech: Due to close historical and linguistic ties
   **život** (life)

2. German: Historical influence
   **farba** (color, from German "Farbe")

3. Hungarian: Historical coexistence
   **guláš** (goulash)

4. Latin and Greek: Scientific and academic terms
   **univerzita** (university)

5. English: Modern loanwords, especially in technology
   **počítač** (computer)

Some common Slovak words and phrases:

- **ahoj** - hello (informal)
- **dobrý deň** - good day (formal greeting)
- **ďakujem** - thank you
- **prosím** - please / you're welcome
- **áno** - yes
- **nie** - no
- **dovidenia** - goodbye

   Literal: To have butter on one's head
   Meaning: To be guilty of something

2. **Hodiť flintu do žita**

## Dialects

While Standard Slovak is based on the Central Slovak dialect, there are several regional dialects:

1. Western Slovak dialects
2. Central Slovak dialects
3. Eastern Slovak dialects
4. Lowland Slovak dialects (spoken in parts of Hungary and Serbia)

These dialects can differ in pronunciation, vocabulary, and some grammatical features. For example:

- Standard: **dobrý deň** (good day)
- Eastern: **dzobri dzeň**

## Colloquial Slovak

Colloquial Slovak, especially as spoken in Bratislava and other urban areas, can differ from standard Slovak in several ways:

1. Shortened forms:
   Standard: **potrebujem** (I need)
   Colloquial: **potrebujem** or **potrepem**

2. Borrowed words, especially from English:
   **Idem na drink s kamošmi** (I'm going for a drink with friends)
   Here, "drink" is used instead of the Slovak "nápoj"

3. Particle usage:
   **No čo, ako bolo?** (Well, how was it?)
   The particle "no" is very common in spoken Slovak

4. Softer pronunciation:
   The sound "l" before "e" and "i" is often pronounced softer, almost like "ľ"

5. Contraction of auxiliary verbs:
   Standard: **Čo si robil?** (What were you doing?)
   Colloquial: **Cos robil?**

## Word Formation

Slovak has several productive ways of forming new words:

1. Prefixation:
   **písať** (to write) → **prepísať** (to rewrite)

2. Suffixation:
   **učiť** (to teach) → **učiteľ** (teacher)

3. Compound words:
   **voda** (water) + **pad** (fall) → **vodopád** (waterfall)

4. Diminutives:
   **stôl** (table) → **stolík** (small table)
   **kniha** (book) → **knižka** (little book)

5. Augmentatives:
   **chlap** (man) → **chlapisko** (big man)

## Numbers

Cardinal numbers:

- 0 - **nula**
- 1 - **jeden** (m.), **jedna** (f.), **jedno** (n.)
- 2 - **dva** (m.), **dve** (f., n.)
- 3 - **tri**
- 4 - **štyri**
- 5 - **päť**
- 10 - **desať**
- 20 - **dvadsať**
- 100 - **sto**
- 1000 - **tisíc**

Ordinal numbers:

- 1st - **prvý**
- 2nd - **druhý**
- 3rd - **tretí**
- 4th - **štvrtý**
- 5th - **piaty**
- 10th - **desiaty**
- 20th - **dvadsiaty**
- 100th - **stý**

Numbers 1-4 agree with the noun they modify in gender, number, and case. For example:

- **jeden muž** (one man)
- **dve ženy** (two women)
- **tri mestá** (three cities)

Numbers 5 and above require the genitive plural of the noun:

- **päť mužov** (five men)
- **desať žien** (ten women)

## Aspect

Aspect is a crucial feature of Slovak verbs, as in other Slavic languages. Most verbs come in aspectual pairs:

1. Imperfective: expresses ongoing, repeated, or habitual actions
2. Perfective: expresses completed actions or actions with a clear endpoint

Examples:

- Imperfective: **písať** (to write, ongoing)
  Perfective: **napísať** (to write, completed)

- Imperfective: **čítať** (to read, ongoing)
  Perfective: **prečítať** (to read through, completed)

- Imperfective: **kupovať** (to buy, ongoing)
  Perfective: **kúpiť** (to buy, completed)

Aspect can change the meaning of a sentence:

- **Písal som list.** (I was writing a letter. - imperfective, focus on the process)
- **Napísal som list.** (I wrote a letter. - perfective, focus on completion)

## Verbal Prefixes

Slovak uses verbal prefixes extensively to modify the meaning and aspect of verbs:

1. **na-**: completion or sufficiency
   **písať** (to write) → **napísať** (to finish writing)

2. **pre-**: through or over
   **čítať** (to read) → **prečítať** (to read through)

3. **vy-**: out or completion
   **piť** (to drink) → **vypiť** (to drink up)

4. **za-**: beginning of action or closure
   **spievať** (to sing) → **zaspievať** (to start singing)

5. **roz-**: distribution or initiation
   **deliť** (to divide) → **rozdeliť** (to distribute)

6. **od-**: away or completion
   **ísť** (to go) → **odísť** (to go away)

## Cases and Their Uses

Slovak has six cases, each with specific uses:

1. Nominative (Nominatív):
   - Subject of the sentence
   **Pes beží.** (The dog runs.)

2. Accusative (Akuzatív):
   - Direct object
   **Vidím psa.** (I see the dog.)

3. Genitive (Genitív):
   - Possession
   **dom otca** (father's house)
   - After certain prepositions
   **do mesta** (to the city)
   - Negation
   **Nemám času.** (I don't have time.)

4. Dative (Datív):
   - Indirect object
   **Dávam knihu priateľovi.** (I'm giving the book to a friend.)
   - With certain verbs
   **Rozumiem ti.** (I understand you.)

5. Locative (Lokál):
   - Location, always used with prepositions
   **v dome** (in the house)
   **na stole** (on the table)

6. Instrumental (Inštrumentál):
   - Means or instrument
   **píšem perom** (I write with a pen)
   - Accompaniment
   **idem s priateľom** (I'm going with a friend)

## Diminutives and Augmentatives

Slovak has a rich system of diminutives and augmentatives:

Diminutives (expressing smallness or endearment):
- **stôl** (table) → **stolík** (small table)
- **kvet** (flower) → **kvetinka** (little flower)
- **pes** (dog) → **psíček** (little dog)

Augmentatives (expressing largeness or crudeness):
- **chlap** (man) → **chlapisko** (big man)
- **baba** (woman) → **babizňa** (old hag)

## Formal and Informal Address

Slovak distinguishes between formal and informal forms of address:

Informal (singular):
- **Ako sa máš?** (How are you?)
- **Odkiaľ si?** (Where are you from?)

Formal or plural:
- **Ako sa máte?** (How are you?)
- **Odkiaľ ste?** (Where are you from?)

The formal form is also used for plural, regardless of the level of formality.

## Reflexive Verbs

Many Slovak verbs are reflexive, using the reflexive pronouns **sa** or **si**:

- **umývať sa** (to wash oneself)
- **učiť sa** (to learn, lit. "to teach oneself")
- **myslieť si** (to think, lit. "to think to oneself")

Sometimes the reflexive pronoun changes the meaning of the verb:
- **hrať** (to play) vs. **hrať sa** (to play around)

## Participles

Slovak has several types of participles:

1. Present active participle:
   **píšuci** (writing)

2. Past active participle:
   **napísavší** (having written)

3. Present passive participle:
   **písaný** (being written)

4. Past passive participle:
   **napísaný** (written)

These are often used to form complex tenses or as adjectives:
- **Napísaný list leží na stole.** (The written letter is lying on the table.)

## Verbal Nouns

Slovak can form verbal nouns (gerunds) from verbs:

- **písať** (to write) → **písanie** (writing)
- **čítať** (to read) → **čítanie** (reading)

These function as regular nouns and can be declined:
- **Písanie listu trvalo hodinu.** (Writing the letter took an hour.)

## Conditional Mood

The conditional mood in Slovak is formed using the particle **by** and the l-participle:

- **Išiel by som.** (I would go. - masculine)
- **Išla by som.** (I would go. - feminine)

The past conditional uses the past tense of **byť** (to be):
- **Bol by som išiel.** (I would have gone. - masculine)
- **Bola by som išla.** (I would have gone. - feminine)

## Impersonal Constructions

Slovak often uses impersonal constructions:

- **Prší.** (It's raining.)
- **Sneží.** (It's snowing.)
- **Je teplo.** (It's warm.)

These can also be used with modals:
- **Treba ísť.** (It's necessary to go.)
- **Možno prísť.** (It's possible to come.)

## Word Order

While Slovak has a relatively flexible word order due to its case system, there are some tendencies:

1. The default order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):
   **Ján číta knihu.** (John reads a book.)

2. The verb is often the second element in a sentence:
   **Včera som videl film.** (Yesterday I saw a movie.)

3. Adjectives usually precede nouns:
   **červené auto** (red car)

4. Clitics (short pronouns, reflexive particles, auxiliary verbs) follow specific rules:
   **Videl som ho.** (I saw him.)

5. For emphasis, elements can be moved to the beginning of the sentence:
   **Knihu číta Ján.** (It's a book that John is reading.)

## Challenges for Learners

Some aspects of Slovak that can be challenging for learners include:

1. The case system and its many declension patterns
2. Verbal aspect (perfective vs. imperfective)
3. Word order, especially with clitics
4. Pronunciation, particularly the distinction between long and short vowels
5. The use of the rhythmic law (alternation of long and short syllables)
6. Mastering the correct use of verbal prefixes

Despite these challenges, Slovak's regular spelling and mostly phonemic orthography can be advantageous for learners.
