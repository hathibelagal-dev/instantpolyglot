# Persian (فارسی)

Persian, also known as Farsi (فارسی), is an Indo-European language spoken by around 110 million people, primarily in Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan. It has a rich literary history dating back over a millennium and has influenced many languages in Central and South Asia. Persian is written in a modified version of the Arabic script, with additional letters to represent sounds not found in Arabic.

## Alphabet and Pronunciation

The Persian alphabet consists of 32 letters, written from right to left. Most letters have four forms: isolated, initial, medial, and final. Here are the letters with their romanized equivalents and approximate pronunciations:

| Letter | Name | Romanization | IPA |
|--------|------|--------------|-----|
| ا | alef | ā / a | [ɒː] / [æ] |
| ب | be | b | [b] |
| پ | pe | p | [p] |
| ت | te | t | [t] |
| ث | se | s | [s] |
| ج | jim | j | [d͡ʒ] |
| چ | che | ch | [t͡ʃ] |
| ح | he | h | [h] |
| خ | khe | kh | [x] |
| د | dāl | d | [d] |
| ذ | zāl | z | [z] |
| ر | re | r | [ɾ] |
| ز | ze | z | [z] |
| ژ | zhe | zh | [ʒ] |
| س | sin | s | [s] |
| ش | shin | sh | [ʃ] |
| ص | sād | s | [s] |
| ض | zād | z | [z] |
| ط | tā | t | [t] |
| ظ | zā | z | [z] |
| ع | eyn | ' | [ʔ] |
| غ | gheyn | gh | [ɢ] / [ɣ] |
| ف | fe | f | [f] |
| ق | qāf | q | [ɢ] / [ɣ] |
| ک | kāf | k | [k] |
| گ | gāf | g | [g] |
| ل | lām | l | [l] |
| م | mim | m | [m] |
| ن | nun | n | [n] |
| و | vāv | v / u / o | [v] / [u] / [o] |
| ه | he | h | [h] / [e] |
| ی | ye | y / i | [j] / [i] |

### Vowels

Persian has six vowels, three short and three long:

| Vowel | IPA | Example |
|-------|-----|---------|
| a | [æ] | **باد** (bād, 'wind') |
| e | [e] | **سر** (sar, 'head') |
| o | [o] | **گل** (gol, 'flower') |
| ā | [ɒː] | **آب** (āb, 'water') |
| i | [iː] | **شیر** (shir, 'milk') |
| u | [uː] | **دور** (dur, 'far') |

Short vowels are usually not written in Persian, except in children's books or language learning materials. In those cases, they are represented by diacritical marks:

- َ (zabar) for /a/
- ِ (zir) for /e/
- ُ (pish) for /o/

### Pronunciation Notes

1. The letter و (vāv) can represent three sounds: [v] as a consonant, and [u] or [o] as a vowel.
   Example: **ورزش** (varzesh, 'exercise'), **دور** (dur, 'far'), **خود** (khod, 'self')

2. The letter ی (ye) can represent both the consonant [j] and the vowel [i].
   Example: **یار** (yār, 'friend'), **شیر** (shir, 'milk')

3. The letters ق and غ are often pronounced identically in modern Persian, usually as [ɢ] or [ɣ].
   Example: **قلب** (qalb, 'heart'), **غذا** (ghazā, 'food')

4. The letter ع ('eyn) is often silent or pronounced as a glottal stop [ʔ].
   Example: **علم** ('elm, 'science'), often pronounced [elm]

5. In colloquial speech, many words are pronounced differently from their written form:
   - **آب** (āb, 'water') is often pronounced [ɒːb] in formal speech but [ɒv] in colloquial speech.
   - **خواب** (khāb, 'sleep') is pronounced [xɒːb] formally but [xɒb] colloquially.

## Morphology

### Nouns

Persian nouns are relatively simple morphologically. They do not have grammatical gender or case inflections. The main features are:

1. Plural formation:
   - For inanimate objects, add ها- (-hā): **کتاب** (ketāb, 'book') → **کتاب‌ها** (ketāb-hā, 'books')
   - For animate beings, often add ان- (-ān): **مرد** (mard, 'man') → **مردان** (mard-ān, 'men')

2. Indefinite marker:
   - Add ی- (-i) to the end of a noun: **کتاب** (ketāb, 'book') → **کتابی** (ketāb-i, 'a book')

3. Ezafe construction:
   - To show possession or attribution, add ِ- (-e) to the end of the first noun: **کتابِ مریم** (ketāb-e Maryam, 'Maryam's book')

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Persian typically follow the noun they modify and are linked by the ezafe construction:

**کتابِ خوب** (ketāb-e khub, 'good book')

When used predicatively, adjectives come after the verb:

**این کتاب خوب است** (in ketāb khub ast, 'This book is good')

Comparative and superlative forms:
- Comparative: add تر- (-tar): **خوب** (khub, 'good') → **خوب‌تر** (khub-tar, 'better')
- Superlative: add ترین- (-tarin): **خوب** (khub, 'good') → **خوب‌ترین** (khub-tarin, 'best')

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | من (man, 'I') | ما (mā, 'we') |
| 2nd | تو (to, 'you') | شما (shomā, 'you') |
| 3rd | او (u, 'he/she/it') | آنها (ānhā, 'they') |

Possessive pronouns are formed by adding ِ- (-e) to the personal pronoun:

**کتابِ من** (ketāb-e man, 'my book')

In colloquial speech, shortened forms are often used:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | ـَم (-am) | ـِمان (-emān) |
| 2nd | ـَت (-at) | ـِتان (-etān) |
| 3rd | ـَش (-ash) | ـِشان (-eshān) |

Example: **کتابم** (ketāb-am, 'my book')

### Verbs

Persian verbs are conjugated for tense, aspect, mood, and person. The infinitive ends in دن- (-dan) or تن- (-tan).

To form the present stem, remove the دن- (-dan) or تن- (-tan) ending:
**خوردن** (khordan, 'to eat') → **خور** (khor-)

To form the past stem, remove ن- (-n) from the infinitive:
**خوردن** (khordan, 'to eat') → **خورد** (khord-)

#### Present Tense

The present tense is formed by adding personal endings to the present stem:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | می‌خورم (mi-khor-am) | می‌خوریم (mi-khor-im) |
| 2nd | می‌خوری (mi-khor-i) | می‌خورید (mi-khor-id) |
| 3rd | می‌خورد (mi-khor-ad) | می‌خورند (mi-khor-and) |

Note the prefix می- (mi-), which is used for the present and imperfect tenses.

#### Past Tense

The simple past is formed by adding personal endings to the past stem:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | خوردم (khord-am) | خوردیم (khord-im) |
| 2nd | خوردی (khord-i) | خوردید (khord-id) |
| 3rd | خورد (khord) | خوردند (khord-and) |

#### Other Tenses and Aspects

1. Present Perfect:
   **خورده‌ام** (khorde-am, 'I have eaten')

2. Past Perfect:
   **خورده بودم** (khorde budam, 'I had eaten')

3. Future:
   **خواهم خورد** (khāham khord, 'I will eat')

4. Subjunctive:
   **بخورم** (be-khor-am, 'that I eat')

5. Imperative:
   **بخور** (be-khor, 'eat!')

#### Negation

Verbs are negated by adding ن- (na-) or نـ- (ne-) to the beginning:
**نمی‌خورم** (ne-mi-khor-am, 'I don’t eat')
**نخوردم** (na-khord-am, 'I didn't eat')

#### Compound Verbs

Persian makes extensive use of compound verbs, consisting of a noun or adjective followed by a light verb:

**صحبت کردن** (sohbat kardan, 'to speak', literally 'speech do')
**یاد گرفتن** (yād gereftan, 'to learn', literally 'memory take')

## Syntax

Persian is an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) language, although the word order can be flexible due to the use of postpositions and the ezafe construction.

Basic sentence structure:
**من سیب می‌خورم** (man sib mi-khor-am, 'I apple eat' = 'I eat an apple')

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding آیا (āyā) at the beginning of a statement or by using rising intonation:

**آیا سیب می‌خوری؟** (āyā sib mi-khor-i?, 'Do you eat an apple?')
**سیب می‌خوری؟** (sib mi-khor-i?, 'You eat an apple?')

Wh-questions use question words such as:
- چه (che, 'what')
- کی (key, 'who')
- کجا (kojā, 'where')
- چرا (cherā, 'why')

**چه می‌خوری؟** (che mi-khor-i?, 'What do you eat?')

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by که (ke, 'that'):

**مردی که دیروز دیدم** (mard-i ke diruz did-am, 'The man that I saw yesterday')

### Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences use اگر (agar, 'if'):

**اگر باران ببارد، در خانه می‌مانم** (agar bārān be-bār-ad, dar khāne mi-mān-am, 'If it rains, I will stay at home')

## Vocabulary

Persian vocabulary has been influenced by various languages throughout its history, including Arabic, Turkish, French, and more recently, English.

1. Arabic loanwords:
   **کتاب** (ketāb, 'book')
   **علم** ('elm, 'science')
   **وقت** (vaqt, 'time')

2. French loanwords:
   **مرسی** (mersi, 'thank you')

3. English loanwords:
   **کامپیوتر** (kāmpyuter, 'computer')
   **تاکسی** (tāksi, 'taxi')
   **فوتبال** (futbāl, 'football')

Many words have both Persian and Arabic origins, with the Persian word often used in colloquial speech and the Arabic in more formal contexts:

- 'begin': **شروع کردن** (shoru' kardan, Arabic origin) vs. **آغاز کردن** (āghāz kardan, Persian origin)
- 'end': **تمام شدن** (tamām shodan, Arabic origin) vs. **پایان یافتن** (pāyān yāftan, Persian origin)

## Formal vs. Colloquial Persian

There is a significant difference between formal (written) Persian and colloquial (spoken) Persian. Some key differences include:

1. Pronunciation:
   Formal: **خواهر** (khāhar, 'sister')
   Colloquial: [xɒːhær]

2. Vocabulary:
   Formal: **اکنون** (aknun, 'now')
   Colloquial: **حالا** (hālā, 'now')

   Colloquial: **اون** (un, 'he/she')

## Politeness and Formality

Persian has a complex system of politeness, reflected in pronouns, verbs, and vocabulary choices:

1. Formal 'you':
   **شما** (shomā) is used as a polite form of 'you', regardless of number.

2. Honorific prefixes:
   **جناب** (jenāb, 'Mr.')

7 - **هفت** (haft)
8 - **هشت** (hasht)
9 - **نه** (noh)
10 - **ده** (dah)

Numbers 11-19 are formed by combining the unit with **ده** (dah, 'ten'):
11 - **یازده** (yāzdah)
12 - **دوازده** (davāzdah)
...
19 - **نوزده** (nuzdah)

Multiples of ten:
20 - **بیست** (bist)

## Phonology and Pronunciation

Persian phonology includes some sounds that may be challenging for English speakers:

1. The glottal stop [ʔ], represented by the letter ع ('eyn):
   **معلم** (mo'allem, 'teacher')

2. The uvular consonant [ɢ], represented by the letter ق (qāf):
   **قلب** (qalb, 'heart')

3. The voiceless uvular fricative [χ], represented by the letter خ (khe):
   **خانه** (khāne, 'house')

4. The voiced uvular fricative [ʁ], represented by the letter غ (gheyn):
   **مغز** (maghz, 'brain')

Some pronunciation rules to note:

1. Stress is generally on the last syllable of a word:
   **کتاب** (ke-TĀB, 'book')

2. The ezafe construction is usually unstressed:
   **کتابِ من** (ke-TĀ-be man, 'my book')

3. In compound verbs, stress falls on the first element:
   **صحبت کردن** (SOH-bat kar-dan, 'to speak')

4. The prefix می- (mi-) used in present and imperfect tenses is unstressed:
   **می‌خورم** (mi-kho-RAM, 'I eat')

## Writing System

Persian uses a modified version of the Arabic alphabet, written from right to left. Some key features of the writing system include:

1. Most letters connect to the following letter:
   **سلام** (salām, 'hello') - س ـلـ ـا م

2. Some letters never connect to the following letter:
   و ز ر ذ د ا

3. Short vowels are usually omitted in writing, except in children's books or language learning materials:
   **کتاب** (ketāb, 'book') is written کتاب, not کِتاب

4. The letter ی (ye) at the end of a word can represent either the consonant [j] or the vowel [i]:
   **زندگی** (zendegi, 'life')

5. Numerals are written from left to right, even though the text is right-to-left:
   ۱۲۳۴ (1234)

## Dialects and Variants

Persian has several major dialects and variants:

1. Iranian Persian (Farsi): The standard form spoken in Iran.

2. Dari: The variety of Persian spoken in Afghanistan, with some differences in vocabulary and pronunciation.

3. Tajik: The variety spoken in Tajikistan, written in the Cyrillic alphabet and with some Russian influence.

4. Hazaragi: Spoken by the Hazara people in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Some differences between Iranian Persian and Dari:

- Pronunciation: 
  Iranian: **خواب** (khāb, 'sleep') [xɒb]
  Dari: **خواب** (khāb, 'sleep') [xɔb]

- Vocabulary:
  Iranian: **هویج** (havij, 'carrot')
  Dari: **زردک** (zardak, 'carrot')

## Persian Literature and Culture

Persian has a rich literary tradition spanning over a millennium. Some key figures and works include:

1. Ferdowsi's **شاهنامه** (Shāhnāme, 'Book of Kings'): An epic poem recounting the mythical and historical past of Iran.

2. Omar Khayyam's **رباعیات** (Rubā'iyāt, 'Quatrains'): A collection of philosophical and often skeptical poems.

3. Rumi's **مثنوی** (Masnavi): A vast collection of spiritual teachings and stories in verse.

4. Hafez's **دیوان** (Divān): A collection of lyric poems (ghazals) that are still widely read and recited today.

Persian poetry often employs complex metaphors and wordplay, making it challenging even for native speakers to fully appreciate without study.
