# Faroese

Faroese (Føroyskt [ˈfœːɹɪst]) is a North Germanic language spoken by about 75,000 people, primarily in the Faroe Islands. It is closely related to Icelandic and West Norwegian dialects, and more distantly to other Scandinavian languages. The language has maintained a relatively conservative structure compared to other Germanic languages, preserving many features of Old Norse.

## Orthography and Pronunciation

Faroese uses a modified Latin alphabet with 29 letters:

A Á B D Ð E F G H I Í J K L M N O Ó P R S T U Ú V Y Ý Æ Ø

The letters C, Q, W, X, and Z are only used in loanwords and foreign names.

### Vowels

Faroese has a complex vowel system with monophthongs and diphthongs:

| Letter | IPA | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| a | [a] | Like 'a' in “father” |
| á | [ɔa] | Diphthong, like 'oa' in “boat” |
| e | [e] | Like 'e' in “bed” |
| i, y | [ɪ] | Like 'i' in “bit” |
| í, ý | [ʊi] | Diphthong, like 'oo-ee' said quickly |
| o | [ɔ] | Like 'o' in “port” |
| ó | [ɔu] | Diphthong, like 'ow' in “cow” |
| u | [ʊ] | Like 'u' in “put” |
| ú | [ʉu] | Diphthong, starts like German 'ü' |
| æ | [ɛa] | Diphthong, like 'ea' in “yeah” |
| ø | [ø] | Like German 'ö' |

### Consonants

| Letter | IPA | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| b | [b], [p] | [b] initially, [p] finally |
| d | [d], [t] | [d] initially, [t] finally |
| ð | [ð] | Like 'th' in “this” |
| f | [f], [v] | [f] initially and finally, [v] between vowels |
| g | [ɡ], [k], [j] | [ɡ] initially, [k] finally, [j] before front vowels |
| h | [h] | Like 'h' in “hat” |
| j | [j] | Like 'y' in “yes” |
| k | [kʰ], [k] | Aspirated initially, unaspirated elsewhere |
| l | [l] | Like 'l' in “light” |
| m | [m] | Like 'm' in “man” |
| n | [n] | Like 'n' in “no” |
| p | [pʰ], [p] | Aspirated initially, unaspirated elsewhere |
| r | [ɹ] | Like British 'r' |
| s | [s] | Like 's' in “see” |
| t | [tʰ], [t] | Aspirated initially, unaspirated elsewhere |
| v | [v] | Like 'v' in “very” |

### Stress

Stress in Faroese words is generally on the first syllable: **maður** [ˈmaːvʊɹ] (“man”), **kona** [ˈkɔːna] (“woman”).

### Orthographic Rules

1. Double consonants indicate a preceding short vowel:
   **katta** [ˈkʰatːa] (“cat”) vs. **eta** [ˈeːta] (“to eat”)

2. 'ð' is never pronounced at the beginning of a word, but affects the preceding vowel:
   **veður** [ˈveːvʊɹ] (“weather”)

3. 'g' is often silent between vowels:
   **dagur** [ˈdɛavʊɹ] (“day”)

## Morphology

### Nouns

Faroese nouns have three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural), and four cases (nominative, accusative, dative, genitive). The definite article is a suffix.

Example declension of **maður** (“man”):

| Case | Singular Indefinite | Singular Definite | Plural Indefinite | Plural Definite |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Nom. | maður | maðurin | menn | menninir |
| Acc. | mann | mannin | menn | menninar |
| Dat. | manni | manninum | monnum | monnunum |
| Gen. | mans | mansins | manna | mannanna |

Example declension of **kona** (“woman”):

| Case | Singular Indefinite | Singular Definite | Plural Indefinite | Plural Definite |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Nom. | kona | konan | konur | konurnar |
| Acc. | konu | konuna | konur | konurnar |
| Dat. | konu | konuni | konum | konunum |
| Gen. | konu | konunnar | kvenna | kvennanna |

### Adjectives

Adjectives agree with nouns in gender, number, and case. They also have strong and weak declensions.

Strong declension of **góður** (“good”):

| Case | Masc. Sg. | Fem. Sg. | Neut. Sg. | Plural |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Nom. | góður | góð | gott | góðir/góðar/góð |
| Acc. | góðan | góða | gott | góðar/góðar/góð |
| Dat. | góðum | góðari | góðum | góðum |
| Gen. | góðs | góðrar | góðs | góðra |

Weak declension is used after the definite article or demonstratives:

| Case | Masc. Sg. | Fem. Sg. | Neut. Sg. | Plural |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Nom. | góði | góða | góða | góðu |
| Acc. | góða | góðu | góða | góðu |
| Dat. | góða | góðu | góða | góðu |
| Gen. | góða | góðu | góða | góðu |

Example: **tann góði maðurin** (“the good man”)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Nominative | Accusative | Dative | Genitive |
|--------|------------|------------|--------|----------|
| 1sg | eg | meg | mær | mín |
| 2sg | tú | teg | tær | tín |
| 3sg m | hann | hann | honum | hansara |
| 3sg f | hon | hana | henni | hennara |
| 3sg n | tað | tað | tí | tess |
| 1pl | vit | okkum | okkum | okkara |
| 2pl | tit | tykkum | tykkum | tykkara |
| 3pl | teir/tær/tey | teir/tær/tey | teimum | teirra |

Demonstrative pronouns:

| | Masc. Sg. | Fem. Sg. | Neut. Sg. | Plural |
|--|-----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| “this” | hesin | henda | hetta | hesir/hesar/hesi |
| “that” | hasin | handa | hatta | hasir/hasar/hasi |

### Numbers

Cardinal numbers:

1-10: **ein/eitt**, **tveir/tvær/tvey**, **tríggir/tríggjar/trý**, **fýra**, **fimm**, **seks**, **sjey**, **átta**, **níggju**, **tíggju**

11-20: **ellivu**, **tólv**, **trettan**, **fjúrtan**, **fimtan**, **sekstan**, **seytjan**, **átjan**, **nítjan**, **tjúgu**

Ordinal numbers:

1st-10th: **fyrsti/fyrsta**, **annar/onnur/annað**, **triði**, **fjórði**, **fimti**, **sætti**, **sjeyndi**, **áttandi**, **níggjundi**, **tíggjundi**

### Verbs

Faroese verbs conjugate for person, number, tense, mood, and voice. There are strong (irregular) and weak (regular) verbs.

Example of a weak verb: **at kalla** (“to call”)

Present tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | eg kalli | vit kalla |
| 2nd | tú kallar | tit kalla |
| 3rd | hann/hon/tað kallar | teir/tær/tey kalla |

Past tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | eg kallaði | vit kallaðu |
| 2nd | tú kallaði | tit kallaðu |
| 3rd | hann/hon/tað kallaði | teir/tær/tey kallaðu |

Example of a strong verb: **at fara** (“to go”)

Present tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | eg fari | vit fara |
| 2nd | tú fert | tit fara |
| 3rd | hann/hon/tað fer | teir/tær/tey fara |

Past tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | eg fór | vit fóru |
| 2nd | tú fórt | tit fóru |
| 3rd | hann/hon/tað fór | teir/tær/tey fóru |

Imperative: **far!** (“go!”)

Present participle: **farandi** (“going”)

Past participle: **farin/farin/farið** (“gone”)

Subjunctive mood:

Present: **eg fari**, **tú farir**, **hann/hon/tað fari**, etc.
Past: **eg fóri**, **tú fórir**, **hann/hon/tað fóri**, etc.

Middle voice:

Faroese has a middle voice formed by adding -st to the verb stem:

**at kalla** (“to call”) → **at kallast** (“to be called”)
**eg kalli** (“I call”) → **eg kallist** (“I am called”)

### Adverbs

Many adverbs are formed by adding -a or -liga to adjectives:

**skjótur** (“quick”) → **skjótt** (“quickly”)
**góður** (“good”) → **væl** (“well”)
**endaligur** (“final”) → **endaliga** (“finally”)

## Syntax

### Word Order

Faroese generally follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in main clauses:

**Eg eti epli.** (“I eat apples.”)

In subordinate clauses, the word order is often Subject-Object-Verb (SOV):

**Eg veit, at tú epli etur.** (“I know that you eat apples.”)

### V2 Word Order

Like other Germanic languages, Faroese has V2 word order in main clauses, meaning the finite verb must be the second constituent:

**Í dag eti eg epli.** (“Today I eat apples.”)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by inverting the subject and verb:

**Etur tú epli?** (“Do you eat apples?”)

Wh-questions start with the question word, followed by the verb:

**Hvat etur tú?** (“What do you eat?”)

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed with **ikki** after the finite verb:

**Eg eti ikki epli.** (“I don’t eat apples.”)

### Passive Voice

Passive voice can be formed in two ways:

1. Using the auxiliary verb **verða** (“to become”) with the past participle:
   **Húsið varð bygt í 1950.** (“The house was built in 1950.”)

2. Using the middle voice:
   **Húsið bygdist í 1950.** (“The house was built in 1950.”)

### Reflexive Constructions

Reflexive pronouns are used to refer back to the subject:

**Eg vasi meg.** (“I wash myself.”)

### Impersonal Constructions

Faroese uses impersonal constructions with **tað** (“it”) as a dummy subject:

**Tað regnar.** (“It rains.”)
**Tað eru nógv fólk her.** (“There are many people here.”)

## Vocabulary

Faroese vocabulary is primarily Germanic in origin, with many words shared with or similar to other Scandinavian languages. However, it also includes unique words and some loanwords from other languages.

Examples of common Faroese words:

1. Family terms:
   **faðir** (“father”), **móðir** (“mother”), **sonur** (“son”), **dóttir** (“daughter”), **systir** (“sister”), **beiggi** (“brother”)

2. Nature terms:
   **fjall** (“mountain”), **dalur** (“valley”), **á** (“river”), **hav** (“sea”), **oyggj** (“island”)

3. Animals:
   **seyður** (“sheep”), **kúgv** (“cow”), **ross** (“horse”), **fuglur** (“bird”), **fiskur** (“fish”)

4. Colors:
   **reyður** (“red”), **bláur** (“blue”), **grønur** (“green”), **gulur** (“yellow”), **svartur** (“black”), **hvítur** (“white”)

5. Time expressions:
   **í dag** (“today”), **í gjár** (“yesterday”), **í morgin** (“tomorrow”), **nú** (“now”), **seinni** (“later”)

### Loanwords

While Faroese has been relatively resistant to loanwords, some have entered the language, particularly in technical and modern contexts:

1. From Danish:
   **snakka** (“to chat”), **forstanda** (“to understand”)

2. From English:
   **teldufar** (“computer”), **bussur** (“bus”)

3. From Latin (often via other languages):
   **skúli** (“school”), **universitetið** (“university”)

### Word Formation

Faroese forms new words through various means:

1. Compounding:
   **summarfrítíð** (“summer vacation”) from **summar** (“summer”) + **frítíð** (“vacation”)

2. Prefixation:
   **ó-** (negation): **óheppin** (“unlucky”) from **heppin** (“lucky”)

3. Suffixation:
   **-leiki** (forms abstract nouns): **vakurleiki** (“beauty”) from **vakur** (“beautiful”)

## Dialectal Variation

While Faroese is relatively uniform across the Faroe Islands, there are some regional variations in pronunciation and vocabulary. The main dialectal divide is between Northern and Southern Faroese:

1. Northern dialects:
   - Tend to preserve [ʊ] before [v]: **trúgva** [ˈtrʊuva] (“to believe”)
   - Often use **eg eri** for “I am” instead of **eg eri**

2. Southern dialects:
   - Often change [ʊ] to [ɪ] before [v]: **trúgva** [ˈtrɪiva]
   - Typically use **eg eri** for “I am”

These differences are minor and do not impede mutual comprehension.

## Phonology

### Consonant Clusters

Faroese allows for complex consonant clusters, especially at the beginning of words:

**skjótur** [ˈʃoːtʊɹ] (“quick”)
**stjørna** [ˈʃœdna] (“star”)
**stranda** [ˈstɹanda] (“to strand”)

### Consonant Assimilation

Faroese exhibits various types of consonant assimilation:

1. Progressive assimilation:
   **ð** becomes voiceless after voiceless consonants:
   **heilsa** + **ði** → **heilsti** [ˈhailstɪ] (“greeted”)

2. Regressive assimilation:
   **n** becomes [m] before labial consonants:
   **einbýlishús** [ˈaimˌbiːlɪshʊːs] (“detached house”)

### Vowel Syncope

Unstressed vowels are often dropped in certain environments:

**gamalt** [ˈɡaːmalt] → [ɡamlt] (“old”, neuter)
**himmalin** [ˈhɪmːalɪn] → [ˈhɪmlɪn] (“the heaven”)

## Morphophonology

### Umlaut

Faroese exhibits umlaut (vowel mutation) in various contexts:

1. i-umlaut:
   **dagur** (“day”) → **degir** (“days”)
   **bók** (“book”) → **bøkur** (“books”)

2. u-umlaut:
   **land** (“land”) → **lond** (“lands”)
   **barn** (“child”) → **børn** (“children”)

### Consonant Gradation

Some words show alternation between strong and weak forms of consonants:

**bóka** (“book”, gen. sg.) → **bógar** (“books”, nom. pl.)
**skip** (“ship”) → **skips** (“ship's”, gen. sg.)

### Modal Verbs

Faroese has several modal verbs that behave differently from regular verbs:

**kunna** (“can, be able to”):
**eg kann**, **tú kanst**, **hann/hon/tað kann**, **vit kunnu**, **tit kunnu**, **teir/tær/tey kunnu**

**skula** (“shall, must”):
**eg skal**, **tú skalt**, **hann/hon/tað skal**, **vit skulu**, **tit skulu**, **teir/tær/tey skulu**

**vilja** (“will, want to”):
**eg vil**, **tú vilt**, **hann/hon/tað vil**, **vit vilja**, **tit vilja**, **teir/tær/tey vilja**

### Phrasal Verbs

Like other Germanic languages, Faroese makes extensive use of phrasal verbs:

**fara av** (“to leave”): **Eg fari av arbeiði klokkan fimm.** (“I leave work at five o'clock.”)
**geva upp** (“to give up”): **Vit góvu upp at finna svarið.** (“We gave up finding the answer.”)

### Aspect

While Faroese doesn’t have a grammaticalized aspect system like Slavic languages, it can express aspectual distinctions through various means:

1. Periphrastic constructions:
   **at vera at** + infinitive (progressive aspect):
   **Eg eri at lesa.** (“I am reading.”)

2. Verbal particles:
   **Eg las bókina.** (“I read the book.”)
   **Eg las bókina út.** (“I read the book completely/to the end.”)

## More on Syntax

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Faroese are introduced by the relative pronouns **sum** or **ið**:

**Maðurin, sum eg sá í gjár, er lærari.** (“The man whom I saw yesterday is a teacher.”)
**Húsið, ið stendur har, er gamalt.** (“The house that stands there is old.”)

### Subordinate Clauses

Various types of subordinate clauses exist in Faroese:

1. Conditional clauses:
   **Um tað regnar, fari eg ikki út.** (“If it rains, I won’t go out.”)

2. Purpose clauses:
   **Eg fari í skúla fyri at læra.** (“I go to school in order to learn.”)

3. Temporal clauses:
   **Tá ið eg kom heim, var eingin har.** (“When I came home, nobody was there.”)

### Topicalization

Faroese allows for topicalization, where an element is moved to the beginning of the sentence for emphasis:

**Hesa bókina havi eg lisið.** (“This book, I have read.”)

### Cleft Sentences

Cleft sentences are used for emphasis:

**Tað var Jógvan, sum vann kappingina.** (“It was Jógvan who won the competition.”)

## Idiomatic Expressions

Faroese has many idiomatic expressions, often related to nature and daily life:

**At kasta eyguni á** (lit. “to throw eyes on”) - “to glance at”
**At ganga sum kavin í fjøruni** (lit. “to go like seaweed on the beach”) - “to be very busy”
**At hava í hyggju** (lit. “to have in mind”) - “to intend”
**At taka dagar ímillum** (lit. “to take days between”) - “to take a break”

## Writing System and Orthography

The Faroese alphabet is based on the Latin script with additional letters:

A Á B D Ð E F G H I Í J K L M N O Ó P R S T U Ú V Y Ý Æ Ø

Some orthographic rules:

1. Double consonants indicate a preceding short vowel:
   **ketta** (“cat”) vs. **eta** (“to eat”)

2. 'ð' is never pronounced at the beginning of a word:
   **ðeir** is written as **teir** (“they”)

3. 'g' is often silent between vowels:
   **eg** [ɛa] (“I”), **sigur** [ˈsiːʊɹ] (“says”)

4. 'hv' is pronounced [kv]:
   **hvat** [kvat] (“what”), **hvítur** [ˈkviːtʊɹ] (“white”)

## Colloquial Faroese

Colloquial Faroese differs somewhat from the written standard:

1. Contractions:
   **eg eri** → **eri** (“I am”)
   **tað er** → **tað'r** (“it is”)

2. Informal pronunciations:
   **einki** [ˈaiŋ̊kɪ] → [ˈaiʃɪ] (“nothing”)
   **okkurt** [ˈɔhkʊɹt] → [ˈɔkʊt] (“something”)

3. Colloquial words:
   **knæstur** (“cool, awesome”) instead of more formal **frálíkur**
   **tann** as a filler word, similar to English “like”

## Code-Switching and Borrowing

Due to the influence of Danish and English, code-switching is common in informal speech:

**Eg downloadaði ein film í gjár.** (“I downloaded a movie yesterday.”)
**Tað var totally awesome!** (“It was totally awesome!”)

However, there are often Faroese alternatives that are preferred in formal contexts:

**Eg tók niður ein film í gjár.** (formal version of “I downloaded a movie yesterday.”)
**Tað var heilt ótrúligt!** (formal version of “It was totally awesome!”)

## Language Policy

The Faroese language policy is generally purist, aiming to create new Faroese words rather than borrowing foreign terms. This has led to the creation of many neologisms:

**telda** for “computer” (from Old Norse **telja**, “to count”)
**alnet** for “internet” (from **alur**, “all” + **net**, “net”)
**fartelefon** for “mobile phone” (from **fara**, “to go” + **telefon**, “telephone”)

However, many international words are still used, especially in informal contexts:

**computer**, **internet**, **mobil**

This tension between purism and internationalism is an ongoing aspect of Faroese language development.
