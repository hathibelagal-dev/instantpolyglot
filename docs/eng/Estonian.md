# Estonian

Estonian is a Finno-Ugric language spoken by about 1.1 million people, primarily in Estonia. It is closely related to Finnish and more distantly to Hungarian. The language is part of the Uralic language family and is not related to the Indo-European languages that surround it geographically.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Estonian uses the Latin alphabet with some additional letters. The pronunciation is generally regular, with stress usually on the first syllable.

### Vowels

Estonian has 9 vowel phonemes:

| Letter | IPA | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| a | [ɑ] | Open back unrounded vowel |
| e | [e] | Close-mid front unrounded vowel |
| i | [i] | Close front unrounded vowel |
| o | [o] | Close-mid back rounded vowel |
| u | [u] | Close back rounded vowel |
| õ | [ɤ] | Close-mid back unrounded vowel |
| ä | [æ] | Near-open front unrounded vowel |
| ö | [ø] | Close-mid front rounded vowel |
| ü | [y] | Close front rounded vowel |

Estonian also distinguishes between short and long vowels. Long vowels are written by doubling the vowel letter:

| Short | Long | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| a | aa | **kala** [ˈkɑlɑ] (fish) vs. **kaalu** [ˈkɑːlu] (weigh, imperative) |
| e | ee | **kena** [ˈkenɑ] (nice) vs. **keena** [ˈkeːnɑ] (boil, imperative) |

### Consonants

| Letter | IPA | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| b | [b] | Voiced bilabial plosive |
| d | [d] | Voiced alveolar plosive |
| f | [f] | Voiceless labiodental fricative |
| g | [ɡ] | Voiced velar plosive |
| h | [h] | Voiceless glottal fricative |
| j | [j] | Palatal approximant |
| k | [k] | Voiceless velar plosive |
| l | [l] | Alveolar lateral approximant |
| m | [m] | Bilabial nasal |
| n | [n] | Alveolar nasal |
| p | [p] | Voiceless bilabial plosive |
| r | [r] | Alveolar trill |
| s | [s] | Voiceless alveolar fricative |
| š | [ʃ] | Voiceless postalveolar fricative |
| z | [z] | Voiced alveolar fricative |
| ž | [ʒ] | Voiced postalveolar fricative |
| t | [t] | Voiceless alveolar plosive |
| v | [ʋ] | Labiodental approximant |

Like vowels, consonants can also be short or long. Long consonants are written by doubling the consonant letter:

| Short | Long | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| k | kk | **luku** [ˈluku] (genitive of lock) vs. **lukku** [ˈlukːu] (into the lock) |
| t | tt | **koti** [ˈkoti] (of the bag) vs. **kotti** [ˈkotːi] (into the bag) |

### Diphthongs

Estonian has a large number of diphthongs. Some examples:

| Diphthong | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| ai | **lai** [lɑi] (wide) |
| ei | **hein** [hein] (hay) |
| oi | **koi** [koi] (moth) |
| õi | **põis** [pɤis] (bladder) |
| äi | **päike** [ˈpæike] (sun) |
| öi | **öine** [ˈøine] (nocturnal) |
| ui | **kui** [kui] (if) |

### Consonant gradation

Estonian exhibits consonant gradation, a process where consonants alternate between strong and weak grades in different forms of the same word. This affects plosives (p, t, k) and some consonant clusters. For example:

| Strong grade | Weak grade | Meaning |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| **leib** [leib] | **leiva** [ˈleiʋɑ] | bread (nominative vs. genitive) |
| **sada** [ˈsɑdɑ] | **saja** [ˈsɑjɑ] | hundred (nominative vs. genitive) |
| **lukk** [lukː] | **luku** [ˈluku] | lock (nominative vs. genitive) |

### Stress

The primary stress in Estonian words is usually on the first syllable: **jalgratas** [ˈjɑlɡrɑtɑs] (bicycle), **õpetaja** [ˈɤpetɑjɑ] (teacher).

In compound words, each component usually retains its stress: **raud·tee·jaam** [ˈrɑudˌteːˈjɑːm] (railway station).

## Morphology

Estonian is an agglutinative language, meaning grammatical functions are expressed by adding suffixes to the stem of a word. This results in long, complex words that can express ideas that might require several words in other languages.

### Nouns

Estonian nouns do not have grammatical gender. They are declined for number (singular and plural) and 14 cases.

- 2nd - **teine**
- 3rd - **kolmas**
- 4th - **neljas**
- 5th - **viies**

### Verbs

Estonian verbs are conjugated for person, number, tense, mood, and voice. They do not distinguish gender.

#### Present tense

The present tense of the verb **olema** (to be):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **olen** | **oleme** |
| 2nd | **oled** | **olete** |
| 3rd | **on** | **on** |

Example with the verb **rääkima** (to speak):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **räägin** | **räägime** |
| 2nd | **räägid** | **räägite** |
| 3rd | **räägib** | **räägivad** |

#### Past tense

Estonian has several past tenses. The most common is the simple past (imperfect):

**olema** (to be) in simple past:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **olin** | **olime** |
| 2nd | **olid** | **olite** |
| 3rd | **oli** | **olid** |

**rääkima** (to speak) in simple past:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **rääkisin** | **rääkisime** |
| 2nd | **rääkisid** | **rääkisite** |
| 3rd | **rääkis** | **rääkisid** |

#### Perfect tenses

Perfect tenses are formed using the auxiliary verb **olema** (to be) and the past participle of the main verb:

Present perfect of **rääkima** (to speak):
- **Ma olen rääkinud** (I have spoken)
- **Sa oled rääkinud** (You have spoken)
- **Ta on rääkinud** (He/She has spoken)

Past perfect:
- **Ma olin rääkinud** (I had spoken)

#### Future tense

Estonian does not have a separate future tense. The present tense is used to express future actions, often with time adverbs for clarity:

- **Ma lähen homme kinno** (I will go to the cinema tomorrow)

#### Conditional mood

The conditional mood is formed by adding **-ks** to the stem:

- **oleksin** (I would be)
- **räägiksin** (I would speak)

#### Imperative mood

The imperative is formed differently for second person singular and plural:

- 2nd person singular: Use the stem of the verb
  - **räägi!** (speak!)
- 2nd person plural: Add **-ge** or **-ke** to the stem
  - **rääkige!** (speak! - to multiple people)

#### Infinitives

Estonian has several infinitive forms:

1. **ma**-infinitive: **rääkima** (to speak)
2. **da**-infinitive: **rääkida**
3. **des**-form (gerund): **rääkides** (while speaking)

#### Participles

1. Present participle: **rääkiv** (speaking)
2. Past participle: **rääkinud** (spoken)
3. Agent participle: **rääkija** (speaker)

### Word formation

Estonian makes extensive use of compounding and derivation to form new words.

#### Compounding

Compound words are formed by combining two or more words:

- **raudtee** (railway) = **raud** (iron) + **tee** (road)
- **külmkapp** (refrigerator) = **külm** (cold) + **kapp** (cabinet)

#### Derivation

New words are often formed by adding suffixes to existing words:

- **-ja** (agent): **õpetaja** (teacher) from **õpetama** (to teach)
- **-us** (abstract noun): **headus** (goodness) from **hea** (good)
- **-lik** (adjective): **sõbralik** (friendly) from **sõber** (friend)

## Syntax

Estonian is primarily an SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) language, but word order can be flexible due to its extensive case system. The word order can change for emphasis or stylistic reasons.

### Basic word order

1. SVO (Subject-Verb-Object):
   **Ma** (S) **ostsin** (V) **raamatu** (O).
   (I bought a book.)

2. OSV (for emphasis on the object):
   **Raamatu** (O) **ma** (S) **ostsin** (V).
   (It was a book that I bought.)

3. VSO (in questions):
   **Ostsin** (V) **ma** (S) **raamatu** (O)?
   (Did I buy a book?)

### Negation

Negation in Estonian is formed using the negative word **ei** before the verb. The verb then appears in a special form (usually similar to the stem):

- **Ma ei räägi eesti keelt.** (I don’t speak Estonian.)
- **Ta ei tulnud täna.** (He/She didn't come today.)

In the past tense, the negative form uses the auxiliary **ei** with the past participle:

- **Ma ei ole rääkinud.** (I haven't spoken.)

### Questions

Yes/no questions can be formed by changing the intonation or by using the question particle **kas**:

- **Kas sa räägid eesti keelt?** (Do you speak Estonian?)

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns at the beginning of the sentence:

- **Mis su nimi on?** (What is your name?)
- **Kus sa elad?** (Where do you live?)

### Subordinate clauses

Subordinate clauses are often introduced by conjunctions such as **et** (that), **kui** (when, if), **sest** (because):

- **Ma tean, et ta tuleb.** (I know that he/she is coming.)
- **Kui sa tuled, helista mulle.** (When you come, call me.)

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses are formed using relative pronouns **kes** (who) for people and **mis** (which, that) for things:

- **Mees, kes seal seisab, on minu isa.** (The man who is standing there is my father.)
- **Raamat, mille ma ostsin, on laual.** (The book that I bought is on the table.)

## Vocabulary

Estonian vocabulary has been influenced by various languages throughout its history. Some common sources of loanwords include:

1. German: due to historical dominance of Baltic Germans
   Example: **kartul** (potato) from German “Kartoffel”

2. Russian: due to Soviet occupation and proximity
   Example: **puskar** (moonshine) from Russian “пушка” (pushka)

3. Finnish: due to linguistic proximity
   Example: **pere** (family) cognate with Finnish “perhe”

4. English: especially in modern technology and pop culture
   Example: **arvuti** (computer)

5. Swedish: due to historical rule
   Example: **reede** (Friday) from Swedish “fredag”

Many Finno-Ugric roots are shared across Estonian and other Uralic languages, which can be helpful for learners familiar with Finnish or Hungarian.

## Colloquial Estonian

Colloquial Estonian differs from the standard written language in several ways:

### Pronunciation

1. Vowel harmony: In some dialects, vowels in unstressed syllables may change to match the vowels in stressed syllables:
   - Standard: **õpetaja** [ɤpetɑjɑ] -> Colloquial: [ɤpetæjæ] (teacher)

2. Consonant weakening: Some consonants may be weakened or dropped in rapid speech:
   - Standard: **ütleb** [ˈytleb] -> Colloquial: [ˈytlev] or [ˈytlev̥] (says)

### Grammar

1. Shortened pronouns: Personal pronouns are often shortened in colloquial speech:
   - **mina** -> **ma** (I)
   - **sina** -> **sa** (you)

2. Particle usage: Colloquial Estonian makes heavy use of particles for emphasis or to convey subtle meanings:
   - **ju** (implies shared knowledge): **Ta on ju haige.** (He's sick, you know.)
   - **küll** (emphasis): **Küll ma tean!** (I certainly know!)

3. Simplified case usage: Some cases might be replaced with simpler constructions:
   - Standard: **Lähen poodi.** (I'm going to the store. - Illative case)
   - Colloquial: **Lähen poodi peale.** (I'm going to the store. - Adessive case with postposition)

4. Contracted forms: Some common phrases are contracted in speech:
   - **ei ole** -> **pole** (is not)
   - **ära tee** -> **ärka** (don’t do)

### Vocabulary

Colloquial Estonian includes many slang terms and loanwords not found in formal language:

- **mobla** (mobile phone) instead of **mobiiltelefon**
- **töö** (cool) borrowed from Finnish, instead of **lahe**
- **okei** (okay) borrowed from English, instead of **hästi**

## Dialects

Estonian has two main dialect groups: North Estonian and South Estonian. The standard language is based on the North Estonian dialect.

1. North Estonian dialects:
   - Central dialect (basis for standard Estonian)
   - Eastern dialect
   - Western dialect
   - Insular dialect

2. South Estonian dialects:
   - Mulgi dialect
   - Tartu dialect
   - Võru dialect (sometimes considered a separate language)

The Võru dialect, spoken in southeastern Estonia, is particularly distinct and has its own literary tradition.

## Writing system

Estonian uses the Latin alphabet with some additional letters:

A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, Š, Z, Ž, T, U, V, Õ, Ä, Ö, Ü

The letters C, Q, W, X and Y are used only in foreign words and names.

### Orthography rules

1. Vowel length: Long vowels are indicated by doubling the vowel letter:
   - **kool** [koːl] (school)
   - **uus** [uːs] (new)

2. Consonant length: Long consonants are indicated by doubling the consonant letter:
   - **kass** [kɑsː] (cat)
   - **pikk** [pikː] (long)

3. Compound words: Generally written as one word without hyphens:
   - **raudtee** (railway)
   - **külmkapp** (refrigerator)

4. Foreign words: Often adapted to Estonian phonology and orthography:
   - **šokolaad** (chocolate)
   - **džungel** (jungle)

## Idiomatic expressions

Estonian has many idiomatic expressions that might be challenging for learners:

1. **Käsi peseb kätt** (Hand washes hand) - You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours
2. **Ega hunt hunti ei murra** (A wolf doesn’t bite another wolf) - Honor among thieves
3. **Kingitud hobuse suhu ei vaadata** (Don’t look in the mouth of a gifted horse) - Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth
4. **Igaüks on oma õnne sepp** (Everyone is the blacksmith of their own happiness) - You make your own luck
5. **Kus suitsu, seal tuld** (Where there's smoke, there's fire) - No smoke without fire

## Politeness and formality

Estonian distinguishes between formal and informal address:

- Informal: **sina** form (you - singular)
- Formal: **teie** form (you - plural, used for formal singular as well)

Example:
- Informal: **Kuidas sa elad?** (How are you?)
- Formal: **Kuidas Te elate?** (How are you? - formal)

Politeness is often expressed through the use of the conditional mood:

- **Kas sa võiksid mulle seda ulatada?** (Could you pass me that?)

## Numbers and time

1. Telling time:
   - **Kell on kolm.** (It's three o'clock.)
   - **Kell on pool neli.** (It's half past three.)
   - **Kell on veerand neli.** (It's quarter past three.)

2. Dates:
   - **23. veebruar 2023** (23rd February 2023)
   - Months are not capitalized in Estonian

3. Cardinal numbers govern the partitive case singular:
   - **üks raamat** (one book - nominative)
   - **kaks raamatut** (two books - partitive singular)
   - **viis raamatut** (five books - partitive singular)
