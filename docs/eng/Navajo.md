# Navajo (Diné bizaad)

Navajo, also known as Diné bizaad, is an Athabaskan language spoken primarily in the southwestern United States, particularly in the Navajo Nation. It is one of the most widely spoken Native American languages in North America, with approximately 170,000 speakers as of 2021. Navajo is known for its complex verb system, tonal phonology, and SOV word order.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Navajo has a rich consonant inventory, including ejectives and aspirated consonants:

| Manner | Labial | Alveolar | Lateral | Postalveolar | Velar | Glottal |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|--------------|-------|---------|
| Stop | p | t | | | k | ʔ |
| Aspirated stop | tʰ | | | kʰ | |
| Ejective stop | tʼ | | | kʼ | |
| Affricate | | ts | tɬ | tʃ | | |
| Ejective affricate | | tsʼ | tɬʼ | tʃʼ | | |
| Fricative | | s | ɬ | ʃ | x | h |
| Nasal | m | n | | | | |
| Approximant | w | | l | j | | |

Examples of minimal pairs showcasing consonant contrasts:

- **tá** (just) vs. **tʼá** (wing)
- **chį́** (hunger) vs. **jį́** (day)
- **kááʼ** (crow) vs. **gááʼ** (rabbit)
- **sá** (old age) vs. **zá** (mouth)

### Vowels

Navajo has four vowel qualities, each with oral and nasal counterparts:

| | Front | Central | Back |
|---|-------|---------|------|
| High | i, ĩ | | |
| Mid | e, ẽ | | o, õ |
| Low | | a, ã | |

Vowel length is also contrastive, resulting in a total of 16 vowel phonemes. Long vowels are typically written with doubled letters.

Examples of minimal pairs showcasing vowel contrasts:

- **ná** (to you) vs. **naa** (around)
- **shił** (with me) vs. **shįł** (younger sibling)
- **chʼil** (plant) vs. **chʼol** (mountain pass)

### Tone

Navajo is a tonal language with four tones:

1. High tone (á)
2. Low tone (à)
3. Rising tone (ǎ)
4. Falling tone (â)

Examples of minimal pairs showcasing tonal contrasts:

- **yá** (sky) vs. **ya** (louse)
- **náʼ** (again) vs. **nàʼ** (enemy)
- **shíí** (I, me) vs. **shii** (my)

### Phonological processes

1. Vowel harmony: Prefixes often assimilate to the vowel quality of the stem.
   Example: **shi-** (1SG possessive) + **-má** (mother) → **shimá** (my mother)
   Example: **bi-** (3SG possessive) + **-zaad** (language) → **bizaad** (his/her language)

2. Consonant mutation: Some consonants change in certain environments.
   Example: **-tą́ą́ʼ** (path) → **atiin** (road)
   Example: **-kaad** (to ask) → **yíílkeed** (he/she asked)

3. Tone sandhi: Tones can change based on adjacent tones.
   Example: **tó** (water) + **-líʼ** (flow) → **tó nílíʼ** (water flows)
   Example: **shí** (I) + **at'ééd** (girl) → **shí át'ééd** (I am a girl)

4. Nasalization spread: Nasalization can spread from nasal consonants to adjacent vowels.
   Example: **mąʼii** (coyote) - the initial **m** causes nasalization of the following vowel

## Morphology

Navajo is a highly agglutinative language with a complex verbal system. The morphology of Navajo is primarily prefixing, with numerous prefixes attaching to verb and noun stems.

### Nouns

Nouns in Navajo are relatively simple compared to verbs. They can be marked for possession and number.

1. Possession:
   Navajo uses possessive prefixes to indicate ownership:
   - **shizhéʼé** (my father)
   - **nizhéʼé** (your father)
   - **bizhéʼé** (his/her father)
   - **nihizhéʼé** (our father)
   - **nohizhéʼé** (your (pl.) father)
   - **dabizhéʼé** (their father)

2. Number:
   Plural is often formed by reduplication or with the suffix **-kę́ę́**.
   - **diné** (man) → **dinée** (men)
   - **tsídii** (bird) → **tsídii kę́ę́** (birds)
   - **łį́į́ʼ** (horse) → **łį́į́ʼ** (horses) - no change
   - **ashkii** (boy) → **ashiiké** (boys) - irregular plural

3. Compound nouns:
   Navajo frequently forms compound nouns:
   - **tsékooh** (canyon) = **tsé** (rock) + **-kooh** (gulch)
   - **chʼéʼétiin** (doorway) = **chʼééʼ** (horizontal) + **atiin** (trail)

### Verbs

Navajo verbs are highly complex, with numerous prefixes and suffixes that indicate various grammatical categories. The verb structure can be represented as follows:

(preverbs) - iterative/distributive - direct object - deictic subject - plural subject - classifier - STEM

1. Verb stem: The core meaning of the verb.
   Example: **-kaad** (to ask)

2. Aspectual prefixes: Indicate the nature of the action.
   - **yi-** (perfective)
   - **yi-...-h** (imperfective)
   - **di-** (inceptive)

3. Subject prefixes: Indicate the subject of the verb.
   - **sh-** (1SG)
   - **ni-** (2SG)
   - **yi-** (3SG)
   - **iid-** (1DU)
   - **oh-** (2DU)
   - **da-** (plural)

4. Object prefixes: Indicate the object of the verb.
   - **shi-** (1SG)
   - **ni-** (2SG)
   - **bi-** (3SG)
   - **nihi-** (1PL)
   - **nohi-** (2PL)
   - **dabi-** (3PL)

5. Classifier prefixes: Modify the meaning of the verb stem.
   - **l-** (causative)
   - **d-** (passive)
   - **ł-** (transitive)

Example of a complex verb form:
**yishkaad** (I ask him/her)
- **yi-** (3SG object)
- **sh-** (1SG subject)
- **-kaad** (to ask)

More complex example:
**chʼínídííłtʼood** (You will drive him/her out)
- **chʼí-** (out)
- **ní-** (perfective)
- **dí-** (inceptive)
- **í-** (2SG subject)
- **ł-** (causative)
- **-tʼood** (to move)

### Verb modes

Navajo verbs have several modes, including:

1. Imperfective: Ongoing or habitual actions
   **naashá** (I am walking)
   **naakai** (They are walking)

2. Perfective: Completed actions
   **yíyá** (I walked)
   **yíí'áázh** (They walked)

3. Future: Actions that will occur
   **deeshááł** (I will walk)
   **doogááł** (They will walk)

4. Iterative: Repeated actions
   **nááshá** (I walk repeatedly)
   **náánikai** (They walk repeatedly)

5. Optative: Desired actions
   **naasháá** (may I walk)
   **naakáá** (may they walk)

6. Progressive: Actions in progress
   **yishááł** (I am in the process of walking)
   **yiikááł** (They are in the process of walking)

### Postpositions

Navajo uses postpositions instead of prepositions. These often inflect for person and number:

- **tsin bikááʼ** (on top of the wood)
- **chidí biih** (inside the car)
- **hooghan bichʼį́** (towards the hogan)
- **shikááʼ** (on top of me)
- **nihitah** (among us)

## Syntax

### Word order

The basic word order in Navajo is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV):

**Ashkii atʼééd yiyiiłtsą́**
Boy girl he-saw-her
"The boy saw the girl"

However, due to the complex verbal system, the subject and object are often incorporated into the verb, allowing for more flexible word order:

**Yiyiiłtsą́ ashkii atʼééd**
He-saw-her boy girl
"The boy saw the girl"

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses in Navajo are typically formed using the relativizer **-ígíí**:

**Ashkii atʼééd yiyiiłtsą́nígíí naalnish**
Boy girl he-saw-her-REL he-works
"The boy who saw the girl is working"

**Atʼééd ashkii yiyiiłtsą́nígíí naaghá**
Girl boy she-saw-him-REL she-walks
"The girl who saw the boy is walking"

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed using the particle **doo** before the verb and **da** after:

**Doo naashá da**
NEG I-walk NEG
"I am not walking"

**Doo chidí biiʼ nahalin da**
NEG car in it-appears NEG
"It doesn't seem to be in the car"

### Questions

Yes/no questions are often formed by adding the particle **lá** or **sh** at the end of a statement:

**Naná lá?**
You-walk Q
"Are you walking?"

**Dibé nílį́į́ sh?**
Sheep they-are Q
"Are they sheep?"

Wh-questions use specific question words:

- **háadi** (where)
- **haaʼí** (which)
- **haitʼéego** (how)
- **haʼátʼíí** (what)
- **haʼátʼíísh** (why)
- **haʼátʼíída** (when)

Examples:
**Háadi naná?**
Where you-walk
"Where are you walking?"

**Haʼátʼíí biniinaa nihaa niya?**
What because-of to-us you-came
"Why did you come to us?"

### Topic and focus

Navajo uses the particle **éí** to mark topics:

**Díí ashkii éí Kinłání góneʼ naagháá**
This boy TOP Flagstaff in he-walks
"As for this boy, he walks in Flagstaff"

Focus can be expressed through word order, with the focused element typically appearing at the beginning of the sentence:

**Tó éí yidlą́**
Water FOC he-drinks
"It's water that he drinks"

### Subordination

Subordinate clauses in Navajo are often formed using nominalization:

**Atʼééd nahałtin biniinaa naashnish**
Girl she-teaches because-of I-work
"I work because the girl teaches"

**Ashkii chidí yiyiiłtsą́ągo naalnish**
Boy car he-saw-it-when he-works
"The boy works when he sees the car"

## Lexicon

### Numbers

Navajo uses a base-10 number system:

1. **tʼááłáʼí**
2. **naaki**
3. **táá'**
4. **dį́į́'**
5. **ashdlaʼ**
6. **hastą́ą́**
7. **tsostsʼid**
8. **tseebíí**
9. **náhástʼéí**
10. **neeznáá**

Numbers above 10 are formed by combination:
20: **naadiin** (2 x 10)
21: **naadiin dóó tʼááłáʼí** (20 and 1)
100: **neeznádiin** (10 x 10)
1000: **tʼááłáʼí mííl** (1 thousand, borrowed from Spanish "mil")

### Color terms

Navajo has four basic color terms:

- **łigai** (white)
- **łizhin** (black)
- **łichííʼ** (red)
- **łitso** (yellow)

Other colors are often described by comparison:
- **yágo** (sky blue, literally "like the sky")
- **chʼil łitso** (green, literally "yellow plant")
- **diłhił** (dark blue/purple, literally "bruise-colored")
- **łibáhí** (gray, literally "like ashes")

### Kinship terms

Navajo kinship terms are complex and distinguish between maternal and paternal relatives:

## Phonotactics

Navajo has relatively simple syllable structure, typically (C)V(C). Consonant clusters are rare and usually occur across syllable boundaries.

Common syllable types:
- V: **a.tiin** (road)
- CV: **tó** (water)
- VC: **atʼééd** (girl)
- CVC: **dził** (mountain)

Some phonotactic constraints in Navajo include:

1. Vowel clusters are not allowed within a single morpheme.
2. Word-initial consonant clusters are not permitted.
3. The glottal stop ʼ cannot occur word-initially.
4. Certain consonant combinations are restricted, e.g., **tl** and **dl** can occur, but **tł** and **dł** cannot.

Examples of permissible and impermissible syllable structures:
- Permissible: **na.ʼa.tsoh** (large barrel cactus)
- Impermissible: **\*naa.tsoh**, **\*nʼa.tsoh**

## Prosody

Stress in Navajo is generally on the first syllable of the stem, which is often the final syllable of the word due to the prefixing nature of the language. However, stress can shift in certain contexts:

1. In compound words, stress typically falls on the first element:
   **tsékooh** (canyon) = **tsé** (rock) + **-kooh** (gulch)

2. In verbs, stress often falls on the syllable containing the classifier prefix:
   **yishchʼid** (I scratch it)

Intonation patterns are closely tied to the tonal system. Yes/no questions often have a rising intonation at the end, while wh-questions typically have a falling intonation:

- Rising: **Dibé nílį́į́ sh?** (Are they sheep?)
- Falling: **Háadi naná?** (Where are you walking?)

Navajo also uses intonation for emphasis and contrast:

- **Shizhéʼé éí naalnish** (My father works) - neutral statement
- **Shizhéʼé éí NAALNISH** (My father WORKS) - emphasized verb

## Writing system

Navajo uses a Latin-based alphabet, developed in the 1930s:

a, ą, b, ch, chʼ, d, dl, dz, e, ę, g, gh, h, hw, i, į, j, k, kʼ, kw, l, ł, m, n, o, ǫ, s, sh, t, tʼ, tł, ts, tsʼ, w, x, y, z, zh, ʼ

The letter **ʼ** represents the glottal stop.

Diacritics are used to mark nasalization (˛) and tone (acute accent for high tone, grave accent for low tone).

Examples of words using various letters:
- **ałchʼį́** (towards each other)
- **dziłbąąh** (mountain climber)
- **ghąąjįʼ** (over there)
- **hwééłtʼéego** (correctly)
- **kʼé** (kinship)
- **łeetsʼaaʼ** (soil)
- **tsʼą́ą́** (excrement)

## Dialectal variation

While Navajo is relatively uniform across its speaking area, there are some regional variations:

1. Western Navajo: Tends to use **-gii** instead of **-ii** in certain words.
   Example: **hooghan** vs. **hoogan** (hogan, traditional dwelling)
   Example: **naagháí** vs. **naaghái** (he/she is walking around)

2. Eastern Navajo: May drop certain initial consonants.
   Example: **yáago** vs. **áago** (sky)
   Example: **yisdá** vs. **isdá** (he/she is sitting)

3. Central Navajo: Often considered the standard dialect, used in most educational materials.
   Example: **yiyiiłtsą́** (he/she saw it)

4. Northern Navajo: May have some unique vocabulary items.
   Example: **azídítsoh** instead of **bisóodi** for "pig"

Some phonological differences include:
- Variation in the pronunciation of **y**: some speakers pronounce it as [j], others as [ʒ]
- In some areas, **ł** may be pronounced as [l] in certain contexts

## Code-switching and bilingualism

Many Navajo speakers are bilingual in English, and code-switching between Navajo and English is common, especially among younger speakers:

**Shimá store góneʼ shopping áyiilaa**
My-mother store in shopping she-did
"My mother went shopping in the store"

**Shí éí computer class bichʼį́ʼ deeshááł**
I TOP computer class towards I-will-go
"I'm going to computer class"

Code-switching can occur at various levels:
1. Word level: **Hooghan biyi' TV silá** (There's a TV inside the hogan)
2. Phrase level: **Baa ntséskees "What should I do?"** (I'm thinking about "What should I do?")
3. Clause level: **Ashkii school góneʼ óołtaʼ but tʼáá hooghandi naná** (The boy studies at school but he walks at home)

## Honorifics and politeness

Navajo doesn't have a complex system of honorifics, but respect is often shown through:

1. Use of kinship terms even for non-relatives
   Example: **Shicheii** (my maternal grandfather) used to address an elderly man

2. Indirect speech
   Example: Instead of directly saying "You're wrong," one might say:
   **Tʼáá ánółtso baa nitsíkees lágo**
   All about-it you-think maybe
   "Perhaps you should think about it more"

3. Avoidance of certain taboo words or topics
   Example: Using **Máʼii** (coyote) instead of directly mentioning dangerous animals

4. Use of the fourth person in storytelling to show respect for characters
   Example: **Jidígíí éí naalnish nít'ę́ę́'** (It is said that this one used to work)

5. Use of plurals for singular referents as a sign of respect
   Example: **Shimá nihaa yah análwo'** (My mother came in to us) - even if speaking to one person

## Idiomatic expressions

Navajo has many idiomatic expressions, often related to nature or traditional life:

**Tó éí iiná**
Water is life
Meaning: Water is essential for life

**Diné niidlín**
Navajo you-are
Meaning: Be proud of your Navajo heritage

**Hózhǫ́ náhásdlíí'**
Beauty it-has-become-again
Meaning: Everything has returned to a state of balance and harmony

**Shil hózhǫ́**
With-me it-is-beautiful
Meaning: I am happy, I am content

**Shiyázhí łichíí'go nahałtin**
My-child red-ly he/she-teaches
Meaning: My child is very intelligent (literally "teaches redly")

**Doo ííshją́ą́ da**
Not I-age not
Meaning: I'm young at heart (literally "I don't age")

**Tʼáá hwó ájítʼé**
Just self it-is-so
Meaning: It is what it is

## Grammaticalization

Navajo shows interesting cases of grammaticalization:

1. The verb stem **-nii** (to say) has grammaticalized into an evidential marker indicating hearsay:
   **Diné yee hadoodzih nisin nii**
   People with-it they-will-speak I-think it-is-said
   "They say people will speak with it (the language)"

2. The postposition **bił** (with) has grammaticalized into a conjunction meaning "and":
   **Ashkii bił at'ééd**
   Boy and girl

3. The verb **ntséskees** (to think) is often used as a discourse marker:
   **Ntséskees, háadi deeshtááł?**
   I-think where I-will-go
   "I wonder, where should I go?"

4. The particle **lá** has grammaticalized from a question particle to a mirative marker indicating surprise:
   **Chidí náánaʼ lá!**
   Car it-crawls MIR
   "The car is moving!" (expressing surprise)

## Discourse markers

Navajo uses various particles and words as discourse markers:

- **háálá** (because, for)
   **Doo deeyá da, háálá shidziil da**
   Not I-went not because I-am-strong not
   "I didn't go because I'm not strong"

- **éí** (topic marker)
   **Díí éí shimá bitsį́į́' át'é**
   This TOP my-mother her-meat it-is
   "This is my mother's meat"

- **lá** (mirative, indicating surprise)
   **Chʼil náána' lá!**
   Plant it-grows MIR
   "The plant is growing!" (expressing surprise)

- **sha'shin** (probably, perhaps)
   **Naaltsoos ałtso ádaalyaa sha'shin**
   Papers all they-were-made probably
   "The papers were probably all made"

- **ndi** (but, however)
   **Naałnish ndi doo bił yáʼátʼééh da**
   He-works but not with-him it-is-good not
   "He works, but he's not happy with it"

- **áádóó** (and then, after that)
   **Chʼíyáán áshłaa áádóó séí**
   Food I-made and-then I-ate
   "I made food and then I ate"

These discourse markers help to structure conversation, indicate the speaker's attitude, and connect ideas in Navajo discourse.
