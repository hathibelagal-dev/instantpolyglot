# Ecclesiastical Latin Varieties

Ecclesiastical Latin, also known as Church Latin or Liturgical Latin, refers to the forms of Latin used by the Roman Catholic Church for liturgical and other ecclesiastical purposes. While based on Classical Latin, Ecclesiastical Latin has evolved distinct pronunciations, vocabulary, and usages over the centuries of church use. This document outlines the major varieties and characteristics of Ecclesiastical Latin.

## Pronunciation

The pronunciation of Ecclesiastical Latin varies somewhat by region and time period, but a standardized “Roman” pronunciation developed in the late 19th/early 20th century is now widely used. Some key features compared to Classical Latin pronunciation:

### Vowels

- Long/short vowel distinction is generally not maintained
- **ae** and **oe** are pronounced as [e], not as diphthongs 
- **y** is pronounced [i], not [y]

| Letter | Ecclesiastical | Classical |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| a | [a] | [a]/[aː] |
| e | [e] | [ɛ]/[eː] |
| i | [i] | [ɪ]/[iː] |
| o | [o] | [ɔ]/[oː] |
| u | [u] | [ʊ]/[uː] |
| y | [i] | [y]/[yː] |
| ae | [e] | [ae̯] |
| oe | [e] | [oe̯] |

Examples:
- **caelum** (“heaven”): [ˈtʃelum] vs Classical [ˈkae̯lʊm]
- **poena** (“punishment”): [ˈpena] vs Classical [ˈpoe̯na]
- **lyra** (“lyre”): [ˈlira] vs Classical [ˈlyra]
- **fides** (“faith”): [ˈfides] vs Classical [ˈfɪdɛs]

### Consonants 

- **c** is always [tʃ] before e, i, ae, oe, y
- **g** is always [dʒ] before e, i, ae, oe, y  
- **t** is [ts] before i followed by a vowel (unless preceded by s, t, x)
- **h** is silent
- **gn** is pronounced [ɲ]
- **ph**, **th**, **ch** are pronounced [f], [t], [k] respectively
- **sc** before e, i, ae, oe, y is pronounced [ʃ]
- **x** is pronounced [ks], not [gz] as in some Classical reconstructions

Examples:
- **cecidi** (“I fell”): [tʃeˈtʃidi] vs Classical [kɛˈkɪdɪ]
- **genu** (“knee”): [ˈdʒenu] vs Classical [ˈɡɛnʊ]
- **gratia** (“grace”): [ˈgratsia] vs Classical [ˈɡraːtɪa]
- **agnus** (“lamb”): [ˈaɲus] vs Classical [ˈagnʊs]
- **philosophia** (“philosophy”): [filoˈsofia] vs Classical [pʰɪlɔˈsɔpʰɪa]
- **theologia** (“theology”): [teoˈlodʒia] vs Classical [tʰɛɔˈlɔɡɪa]
- **cherubim** (“cherubim”): [keˈrubim] vs Classical [ˈkʰɛrʊbɪm]
- **descendit** (“he descended”): [deˈʃendit] vs Classical [dɛˈskɛndɪt]
- **excelsis** (“in the highest”): [ekˈtʃelsis] vs Classical [ɛkˈkɛlsɪs]

### Stress

Stress follows the same rules as Classical Latin:
- On the penultimate syllable if it is long
- Otherwise on the antepenultimate syllable

Examples: 
- **misericórdia** (“mercy”)
- **grátia** (“grace”)
- **glória** (“glory”)
- **ecclésia** (“church”)
- **resurrectiónem** (“resurrection”)

### Regional Variations

While there is a standardized “Roman” pronunciation, regional variations exist, influenced by local languages. Some examples:

#### Italian/Roman

- **c** before e, ae, oe, i, y: [tʃ]
- **g** before e, ae, oe, i, y: [dʒ]
- **gn**: [ɲ]
- **gl+i**: [ʎ]

Examples: 
- **regina** (“queen”): [reˈdʒina]

#### German

- **c** before e, ae, oe, i, y: [ts]
- **g** before e, ae, oe, i, y: [g]

- **sanctum** (“holy”): [sɑ̃ktœ̃]
- **una** (“one”): [ynə]

## Orthography

Ecclesiastical Latin largely maintains Classical Latin orthography, with a few notable differences:

- Use of **j** instead of **i** in some words: **Jesus** vs Classical **Iesus**
- Use of **v** instead of **u** for consonantal u: **veni** vs Classical **ueni**
- Capitalization of proper nouns and the first word of sentences
- Use of punctuation marks like period, comma, question mark
- Diacritical marks sometimes used for pedagogical purposes or in hymnals to indicate stress

Some medieval manuscripts and early printed texts may use additional letter forms or abbreviations, such as:

- **æ** or **œ** ligatures for **ae** and **oe**
- **ſ** (long s) for non-final **s**
- Various abbreviation symbols, e.g. **p̄** for **per**, **q̄** for **que**

Examples of orthographic variations:

Classical | Ecclesiastical
----------|---------------
**Iesus Christus** | **Jesus Christus**
**uita** | **vita**
**caelum** | **cælum** (in some texts)
**quamquam** | **quamquā** (in manuscripts)

## Vocabulary

## Grammar

Ecclesiastical Latin grammar is largely based on Classical Latin, but with some simplifications and changes in usage.

### Nouns

The case system is maintained, but some forms may be used interchangeably:

- Ablative often used instead of locative: **Romae**/**Roma** (“in Rome”)
- Accusative sometimes used for duration instead of ablative: **tres dies** for “for three days”
- Increased use of prepositions to clarify case relationships

Examples:
- Classical: **Romae vixit** (“He lived in Rome”)
  Ecclesiastical: **In Roma vixit** (“He lived in Rome”)
- Classical: **Tribus diebus** (“For three days”, ablative of time)
  Ecclesiastical: **Per tres dies** (“For three days”, accusative with preposition)

### Verbs

- Perfect and imperfect subjunctive often used interchangeably
- Increased use of auxiliary verbs, especially **habere** to form perfect tenses
- Future participle with forms of **esse** used as a periphrastic future
- Tendency to use indicative where Classical Latin might use subjunctive

Examples:
- Classical: **amabo** (“I will love”)
  Ecclesiastical: **amaturus sum** (“I am about to love”)
- Classical: **Cum venisset** (“When he had come”, subjunctive)
  Ecclesiastical: **Cum venit** (“When he came”, indicative)
- Classical: **Dixit se venturum esse** (“He said he would come”)
  Ecclesiastical: **Dixit quod venturus erat** (“He said that he was going to come”)

### Syntax

- Word order tends to be freer than in Classical Latin
- Increased use of subordinate clauses with **quod**, **quia** instead of accusative and infinitive construction
- More frequent use of finite verbs instead of participles

Examples:
- Classical: **Scio eum venisse** (“I know that he came”)
  Ecclesiastical: **Scio quod venit** (“I know that he came”)
- Classical: **Urbe capta, hostis discessit** (“The city having been captured, the enemy departed”)
  Ecclesiastical: **Postquam urbs capta est, hostis discessit** (“After the city was captured, the enemy departed”)

### Pronouns

- Increased use of pronouns where Classical Latin might omit them
- **ille** often used as a definite article

Examples:
- Classical: **Dico** (“I say”)
  Ecclesiastical: **Ego dico** (“I say”)
- Classical: **homo** (“the man”)
  Ecclesiastical: **ille homo** (“the man”)

## Liturgical Use

Ecclesiastical Latin remains the official language of the Roman Catholic Church and is used in various liturgical contexts. Some key uses include:

### Mass

The Traditional Latin Mass (Extraordinary Form) is conducted entirely in Latin. The Ordinary Form (Novus Ordo) may use Latin or vernacular languages. Key Latin phrases include:

- **Dominus vobiscum** (“The Lord be with you”)
- **Et cum spiritu tuo** (“And with your spirit”)
- **Oremus** (“Let us pray”)
- **Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus** (“Holy, Holy, Holy”)
- **Agnus Dei** (“Lamb of God”)
- **Corpus Christi** (“The Body of Christ”)

Example from the Roman Canon:

**Te igitur, clementissime Pater, per Iesum Christum, Filium tuum, Dominum nostrum, supplices rogamus ac petimus, uti accepta habeas et benedicas haec dona, haec munera, haec sancta sacrificia illibata.**

(“Therefore, most merciful Father, we humbly pray and implore You through Jesus Christ, Your Son, our Lord, to accept and bless these gifts, these offerings, these holy and unblemished sacrifices.”)

### Papal Documents

Official papal documents are typically issued in Latin, often with translations in modern languages. The opening words often serve as the document's title. Examples:

- **Summorum Pontificum** (“Of the Supreme Pontiffs”)
- **Lumen Fidei** (“The Light of Faith”)
- **Laudato Si'** (“Praise Be to You”)
- **Amoris Laetitia** (“The Joy of Love”)
- **Evangelii Gaudium** (“The Joy of the Gospel”)

Example from Lumen Fidei:

**Lumen fidei: hoc nomine traditio Ecclesiae donum ultimum appellavit quod Iesus, Resuscitatus, suis discipulis attulit.**

(“The light of faith: this is how the Church's tradition speaks of the great gift brought by Jesus.”)

### Hymns and Prayers

Many traditional hymns and prayers are in Latin. Examples:

- **Ave Maria** (“Hail Mary”)
- **Pater Noster** (“Our Father”)
- **Adeste Fideles** (“O Come, All Ye Faithful”)
- **Salve Regina** (“Hail, Holy Queen”)
- **Tantum Ergo** (“Down in Adoration Falling”)
- **Dies Irae** (“Day of Wrath”)

Example from Adeste Fideles:

**Adeste fideles, laeti triumphantes,
Venite, venite in Bethlehem.
Natum videte Regem angelorum.
Venite adoremus, venite adoremus,
Venite adoremus Dominum.**

(“O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
Come and behold Him, born the King of Angels.
O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.”)

## Medieval and Renaissance Latin

While not strictly “Ecclesiastical,” Medieval and Renaissance forms of Latin were heavily influenced by Church usage and are often encountered in religious and scholarly contexts.

### Medieval Latin

- Increased use of abstract nouns
- New word formations, often from vernacular languages
- Simplified grammar, e.g. reduced use of deponent verbs
- Increased use of prepositions instead of case endings
- Development of new grammatical structures, e.g. the passive infinitive with **esse**

Examples:
- **realitas** (“reality”) - abstract noun formation
- **imprisonare** (“to imprison”) - verb from Old French
- **guerra** (“war”) - from Germanic, replacing Classical **bellum**
- **in civitate** (“in the city”) instead of Classical ablative **civitate**
- **dictum est esse faciendum** (“it is said to be necessary to do”) - passive infinitive construction

More examples of Medieval Latin innovations:

- **frenum** (“bridle”) becomes **frenus**
- **gaudium** (“joy”) becomes **gaudia** in singular
- Use of **quod** for “that” instead of accusative and infinitive: **Credo quod Deus est** (“I believe that God exists”)
- New compounds: **arquebusium** (“arquebus”, a type of gun)
- Greek loanwords: **synodus** (“synod”), **schisma** (“schism”)

Example text from St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologiae:

**Respondeo dicendum quod necesse est ponere aliquas creaturas incorporeas. Id enim quod praecipue in rebus creatis Deus intendit, est bonum quod consistit in assimilatione ad Deum.**

(“I answer that it is necessary to suppose that there are some incorporeal creatures. For what God chiefly intends in created things is the good that consists in assimilation to God.”)

### Renaissance Latin

- Attempt to return to Classical norms
- Continued use of medieval vocabulary for concepts unknown in antiquity
- Influence of vernacular word order
- Renewed interest in Ciceronian style
- Increased use of Classical rhetorical devices

Examples:
- **typographus** (“printer”) - new word for new technology
- **America** - new geographical term
- **protestans** (“Protestant”) - new religious term

Example sentence:
**Typographus librum novum impressit** (“The printer printed a new book”)
- **typographus** and **impressit** are non-Classical terms for the new technology of printing

Example from Erasmus' Praise of Folly (Moriae Encomium):

**Stultitiam loquor, sed eam quae me deam fecit. Sed quid ego haec commemoro? Quasi vero non ipsa fronte, non ipso vultu prae me feram quis ego sim, aut quasi si quis me Minervam aut Sophiam esse contendat, non statim vel solo aspectu coargui possit, etiam si nulla accedat oratio, sincerus ille animi index.**

(“I speak of Folly, but of that folly which has made me a goddess. But why do I mention these things? As if I did not bear on my very brow who I am, or as if anyone who claimed I was Minerva or Sophia could not be immediately refuted by a single glance, even if no words were spoken, for the face is the true index of the mind.”)

## Ecclesiastical Latin in Modern Use

While Latin is no longer the primary language of communication in the Catholic Church, it continues to play a significant role in various contexts:

### Vatican Documents

Official documents from the Vatican are still issued in Latin, often accompanied by translations. The Latin version is considered the official text. Examples include:

- Papal encyclicals
- Apostolic constitutions
- Motu proprio documents

Example from Pope Francis' encyclical Laudato Si':

**Laudato si', mi' Signore, cum tucte le tue creature, spetialmente messor lo frate sole, lo qual è iorno, et allumini noi per lui. Et ellu è bellu e radiante cum grande splendore: de te, Altissimo, porta significatione.**

(“Praise be to you, my Lord, with all your creatures, especially Sir Brother Sun, who is the day and through whom you give us light. And he is beautiful and radiant with great splendor; and bears a likeness of you, Most High.”)

### Academic Use

Latin remains important in Catholic theological and philosophical studies. Many academic degrees in these fields have Latin names, such as:

- **Sacrae Theologiae Doctor** (S.T.D.) - Doctor of Sacred Theology
- **Iuris Canonici Licentiatus** (J.C.L.) - Licentiate of Canon Law
- **Philosophiae Doctor** (Ph.D.) - Doctor of Philosophy

Latin is also used in the formal defense of doctoral theses in some Catholic universities.

Example of a thesis defense opening:

**Ad laudem Sanctae Trinitatis, ad exaltationem Fidei Catholicae et ad incrementum scientiae, ego N.N. hanc dissertationem publice defendam.**

(“To the praise of the Holy Trinity, for the exaltation of the Catholic Faith, and for the advancement of knowledge, I, [Name], will publicly defend this dissertation.”)

### Motto and Inscriptions

Latin is often used for mottos of Catholic institutions and inscriptions on buildings:

- **Pontificia Universitas Gregoriana**: “Religioni et Bonis Artibus” (“For Religion and Culture”)
- St. Peter's Basilica: **“Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam”** (“You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church”)
- University of Notre Dame: **“Vita, Dulcedo, Spes”** (“Life, Sweetness, Hope”)
- Georgetown University: **“Utraque Unum”** (“Both into One”)

### Canon Law

The official text of the Code of Canon Law (Codex Iuris Canonici) is in Latin. Example canons:

**Can. 748 §1. Omnes homines veritatem in iis, quae Deum eiusque Ecclesiam respiciunt, quaerere tenentur eamque cognitam amplectendi ac servandi obligatione vi legis divinae adstringuntur.**

(“All persons are bound to seek the truth in those things which regard God and his Church and by virtue of divine law are bound by the obligation and possess the right of embracing and observing the truth which they have come to know.”)

**Can. 1055 §1. Matrimoniale foedus, quo vir et mulier inter se totius vitae consortium constituunt, indole sua naturali ad bonum coniugum atque ad prolis generationem et educationem ordinatum, a Christo Domino ad sacramenti dignitatem inter baptizatos evectum est.**

(“The matrimonial covenant, by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life and which is ordered by its nature to the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring, has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament between the baptized.”)

### Liturgical Music

Latin continues to be used in liturgical music, both traditional and contemporary. Examples include:

- Gregorian chant: **“Adoro te devote”**, **“Pange lingua gloriosi”**
- Polyphonic compositions: Palestrina's **“Missa Papae Marcelli”**
- Modern compositions: **“Ubi caritas”** by Maurice Duruflé

Example from “Adoro te devote”:

**Adoro te devote, latens Deitas,
Quae sub his figuris vere latitas;
Tibi se cor meum totum subiicit,
Quia te contemplans totum deficit.**

(“I devoutly adore you, O hidden Deity,
Truly hidden beneath these appearances.
My whole heart submits to you,
And in contemplating you, it surrenders itself completely.”)

## Ecclesiastical Latin in Scientific Nomenclature

While not strictly ecclesiastical, the influence of Church Latin extended into scientific fields, particularly in taxonomy and anatomy.

### Biological Taxonomy

Carl Linnaeus established the system of binomial nomenclature using Latin. Examples:

- **Homo sapiens** (wise man) - humans
- **Felis catus** (cat) - domestic cat
- **Quercus robur** (strength oak) - English oak

### Anatomical Terms

Many anatomical terms are derived from Ecclesiastical or Medieval Latin. Examples:

- **Corpus callosum** (“tough body”) - the structure connecting the brain's hemispheres
- **Foramen magnum** (“great hole”) - the large opening in the base of the skull
- **Vena cava** (“hollow vein”) - the large vein carrying deoxygenated blood to the heart
