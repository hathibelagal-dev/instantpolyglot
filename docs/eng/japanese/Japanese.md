# Japanese

Japanese (日本語, nihongo) is an East Asian language spoken by about 128 million people, primarily in Japan. It is an agglutinative language with a complex system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society. The language is relatively uniform, with only minor dialectal differences in grammar, though pronunciation can vary significantly between regions.

## Writing System

Japanese uses a combination of three writing systems: kanji (Chinese characters), hiragana, and katakana. Romaji, the Latin alphabet, is also used for some purposes.

### Kanji

Kanji (漢字) are logographic characters borrowed from Chinese. There are thousands of kanji in use, with about 2,000 taught in schools and considered necessary for functional literacy. Each kanji can have multiple readings depending on context.

Example:
- 木 (ki / moku) - tree
- 森 (mori) - forest (composed of three 木)

### Hiragana

Hiragana (ひらがな) is a phonetic script used for native Japanese words, grammatical particles, and inflectional endings. It consists of 46 basic characters.

### Katakana

Katakana (カタカナ) is another phonetic script, primarily used for loanwords, onomatopoeia, and sometimes for emphasis. It also has 46 basic characters.

### Basic Hiragana and Katakana Charts

| Hiragana | Katakana | Romaji |
|----------|----------|--------|
| あ | ア | a |
| い | イ | i |
| う | ウ | u |
| え | エ | e |
| お | オ | o |
| か | カ | ka |
| き | キ | ki |
| く | ク | ku |
| け | ケ | ke |
| こ | コ | ko |

(This chart would continue with the remaining characters)

## Pronunciation

Japanese phonology is relatively simple, with only 5 vowel sounds and 14 consonant sounds. The language has a pitch accent system, which can affect the meaning of words.

### Vowels

| Vowel | Sound | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| あ / ア | [a] | **赤い** (aka'i) [akaꜜi] - red |
| い / イ | [i] | **意味** (imi) [iꜜmi] - meaning |
| う / ウ | [ɯ] | **上手** (umaꜜi) [ɯmaꜜi] - skillful |
| え / エ | [e] | **映画** (eiga) [eꜜiga] - movie |
| お / オ | [o] | **大きい** (ōki'i) [oːꜜkiː] - big |

Note: Long vowels are indicated by a macron in romaji (ā, ī, ū, ē, ō) and are pronounced for approximately twice the duration of short vowels.

### Consonants

Japanese consonants are generally similar to English, with a few exceptions:

- **ら行** (ra-gyō): The Japanese "r" sound is a flapped [ɾ], similar to the "tt" in American English "butter"
  Example: **りんご** (ringo) [ɾiŋgo] - apple

- **は行** (ha-gyō): The "h" becomes [ɸ] before "u"
  Example: **ふたつ** (futatsu) [ɸɯꜜtatsɯ] - two

- Geminate consonants (doubled consonants) are held for a beat
  Example: **きって** (kitte) [kitꜜte] - stamp

### Pitch Accent

Japanese has a pitch accent system where the pitch of a word can change its meaning. This is different from stress accent languages like English. 

Example:
- **箸** (haꜜshi) - chopsticks
- **橋** (hashiꜜ) - bridge

The downward arrow (ꜜ) indicates where the pitch drops.

## Morphology

Japanese is an agglutinative language, meaning that grammatical elements are added to the end of words as suffixes or particles.

### Nouns

Japanese nouns do not have grammatical gender or number. Plurality can be indicated by context, counters, or suffixes like たち (-tachi) for people.

Example:
- **猫** (neko) can mean "cat" or "cats"
- **猫たち** (neko-tachi) specifically means "cats" (plural)

Nouns can be formed by compounding:
- **手** (te) - hand
- **紙** (kami) - paper
- **手紙** (tegami) - letter (hand + paper)

### Particles

Particles are short words that follow nouns, verbs, or sentences to indicate grammatical function. Some common particles include:

- **は** (wa) - topic marker
- **が** (ga) - subject marker
- **を** (o) - direct object marker
- **に** (ni) - indirect object marker, direction, time
- **で** (de) - location of action, means
- **の** (no) - possessive, descriptor

Example:
**私は日本語で手紙を書きます。**
(Watashi wa nihongo de tegami o kakimasu.)
[wataꜜshi wa nihongo de tegami o kakimasɯ]
"I write letters in Japanese."

### Pronouns

Japanese has many pronouns, and their usage depends on the social context, the speaker's gender, and the relationship between the speaker and the listener. Some common pronouns include:

First person:
- **私** (watashi) - I (neutral)
- **僕** (boku) - I (masculine, informal)
- **俺** (ore) - I (masculine, very informal)

Second person:
- **あなた** (anata) - you (can be impolite in some contexts)
- **君** (kimi) - you (informal, often used by men)

Third person:
- **彼** (kare) - he
- **彼女** (kanojo) - she

Note that pronouns are often omitted when the subject is clear from context.

### Adjectives

Japanese has two main types of adjectives:

1. い-adjectives (形容詞, keiyōshi)
   These end in い and conjugate directly.
   Example: **高い** (taka'i) - expensive/tall

2. な-adjectives (形容動詞, keiyōdōshi)
   These are followed by な when modifying a noun and behave more like nouns.
   Example: **きれいな** (kireina) - beautiful/clean

Conjugation of い-adjectives:

| Form | Example |
|------|---------|
| Present affirmative | **高い** (taka'i) - is expensive |
| Present negative | **高くない** (takaku na'i) - is not expensive |
| Past affirmative | **高かった** (takakatta) - was expensive |
| Past negative | **高くなかった** (takaku nakatta) - was not expensive |

Conjugation of な-adjectives:

| Form | Example |
|------|---------|
| Present affirmative | **きれいだ** (kirei da) - is beautiful |
| Present negative | **きれいじゃない** (kirei ja na'i) - is not beautiful |
| Past affirmative | **きれいだった** (kirei datta) - was beautiful |
| Past negative | **きれいじゃなかった** (kirei ja nakatta) - was not beautiful |

### Verbs

Japanese verbs are conjugated for tense, politeness, and aspect, but not for person or number. There are three main types of verbs:

1. Godan (五段) verbs
2. Ichidan (一段) verbs
3. Irregular verbs

#### Godan Verbs

Godan verbs change their final syllable during conjugation. An example with **書く** (kaku) - to write:

| Form | Conjugation |
|------|-------------|
| Dictionary form | **書く** (kaku) |
| Polite present | **書きます** (kakimasu) |
| Polite past | **書きました** (kakimashita) |
| Plain negative | **書かない** (kakanai) |
| Te-form | **書いて** (kaite) |

#### Ichidan Verbs

Ichidan verbs are easier to conjugate, as they simply drop the final る and add endings. An example with **食べる** (taberu) - to eat:

| Form | Conjugation |
|------|-------------|
| Dictionary form | **食べる** (taberu) |
| Polite present | **食べます** (tabemasu) |
| Polite past | **食べました** (tabemashita) |
| Plain negative | **食べない** (tabenai) |
| Te-form | **食べて** (tabete) |

#### Irregular Verbs

The two main irregular verbs are **する** (suru) - to do, and **来る** (kuru) - to come:

**する** (suru) - to do:

| Form | Conjugation |
|------|-------------|
| Dictionary form | **する** (suru) |
| Polite present | **します** (shimasu) |
| Polite past | **しました** (shimashita) |
| Plain negative | **しない** (shinai) |
| Te-form | **して** (shite) |

**来る** (kuru) - to come:

| Form | Conjugation |
|------|-------------|
| Dictionary form | **来る** (kuru) |
| Polite present | **来ます** (kimasu) |
| Polite past | **来ました** (kimashita) |
| Plain negative | **来ない** (konai) |
| Te-form | **来て** (kite) |

### Verb Aspects and Voices

Japanese has several verbal aspects and voices, including:

1. Causative: Makes someone do something
   Formation: Verb stem + させる
   Example: **食べさせる** (tabesaseru) - to make (someone) eat

2. Passive: Action done to the subject
   Formation: Verb stem + られる
   Example: **食べられる** (taberareru) - to be eaten

3. Potential: Ability to do something
   Formation: For ichidan verbs, replace る with られる; for godan verbs, change the last kana to the え sound and add る
   Example: **食べられる** (taberareru) - can eat; **書ける** (kakeru) - can write

4. Volitional: Expressing intention or suggestion
   Formation: For ichidan verbs, replace る with よう; for godan verbs, change the last kana to the お sound and add う
   Example: **食べよう** (tabeyō) - let's eat; **書こう** (kakō) - let's write

## Syntax

Japanese follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, which is different from English's SVO order.

Basic sentence structure:
(Topic) (Subject) (Object) (Verb)

Example:
**私は昨日図書館で本を読みました。**
(Watashi wa kinō toshokan de hon o yomimashita.)
[wataꜜshi wa kinoː toshokan de hoꜜn o jomimashita]
"I read a book at the library yesterday."

In this sentence:
- 私は (watashi wa) - I (topic)
- 昨日 (kinō) - yesterday (time)
- 図書館で (toshokan de) - at the library (location)
- 本を (hon o) - book (object)
- 読みました (yomimashita) - read (verb, past tense, polite form)

### Topic and Subject

Japanese is a topic-prominent language, often using the particle は (wa) to mark the topic of a sentence. The particle が (ga) is used to mark the grammatical subject.

Example:
**象は鼻が長い。**
(Zō wa hana ga naga'i.)
[zoː wa hana ga nagaꜜi]
"As for elephants, (their) noses are long."

Here, "elephants" is the topic of the sentence, while "noses" is the grammatical subject.

### Relative Clauses

Japanese doesn't use relative pronouns. Instead, the modifying clause comes before the noun it describes.

Example:
**私が読んだ本**
(Watashi ga yonda hon)
[wataꜜshi ga jonda hon]
"The book that I read"

### Question Formation

Questions are formed by adding the particle か (ka) at the end of a sentence or by using question words.

Example:
**日本語を話しますか。**
(Nihongo o hanashimasu ka.)
[nihongo o hanashimasɯ ka]
"Do you speak Japanese?"

Question words:
- **何** (nani) - what
- **誰** (dare) - who
- **どこ** (doko) - where
- **いつ** (itsu) - when
- **なぜ** (naze) / **どうして** (dōshite) - why
- **どう** (dō) - how

Example:
**何を食べましたか。**
(Nani o tabemashita ka.)
[naꜜni o tabemashita ka]
"What did you eat?"

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed by changing the verb or adjective ending.

For verbs:
- Polite form: ます (masu) → ません (masen)
- Plain form: う-ending → ない (nai)

Example:
**日本語を話します。** → **日本語を話しません。**
(Nihongo o hanashimasu.) → (Nihongo o hanashimasen.)
[nihongo o hanashimasɯ] → [nihongo o hanashimaseꜜn]
"I speak Japanese." → "I don't speak Japanese."

For い-adjectives:
Replace い with くない

Example:
**高い** → **高くない**
(Taka'i) → (Takaku na'i)
[takaꜜi] → [takakɯ naꜜi]
"expensive" → "not expensive"

For な-adjectives:
Add じゃない (ja nai) after the stem

Example:
**きれい** → **きれいじゃない**
(Kirei) → (Kirei ja na'i)
[kiɾeꜜi] → [kiɾeꜜi ʑa naꜜi]
"beautiful" → "not beautiful"

## Honorifics and Politeness

Japanese has an extensive system of honorifics and polite language, known as 敬語 (keigo). This system reflects the social relationships between speakers, listeners, and referents. There are three main types of honorific speech:

1. 尊敬語 (sonkeigo) - Respectful language
2. 謙譲語 (kenjōgo) - Humble language
3. 丁寧語 (teineigo) - Polite language

### Respectful Language (尊敬語, sonkeigo)

Used to show respect to the person being talked about. It often involves special verb forms or prefixes.

Example:
**食べる** (taberu) → **召し上がる** (meshiagaru)
"to eat" → "to eat" (respectful)

**先生はもう到着されました。**
(Sensei wa mō tōchaku saremashita.)
[seꜜnsei wa moː toːʨakɯ saɾemashita]
"The teacher has already arrived." (respectful)

### Humble Language (謙譲語, kenjōgo)

Used to lower oneself when talking about one's actions to someone of higher status.

Example:
**行く** (iku) → **伺う** (ukagau)
"to go" → "to go" (humble)

**明日お客様のところへ伺います。**
(Ashita okyaku-sama no tokoro e ukagaimasu.)
[ashita okʲakɯsama no tokoro e ɯkagaimasɯ]
"I will go to the customer's place tomorrow." (humble)

### Polite Language (丁寧語, teineigo)

Used to show general politeness, often by using the です/ます (desu/masu) forms of verbs and adjectives.

Example:
**これは本です。**
(Kore wa hon desu.)
[koɾe wa hon desɯ]
"This is a book." (polite)

vs.

**これは本だ。**
(Kore wa hon da.)
[koɾe wa hon da]
"This is a book." (plain)

### Honorific Prefixes

The prefixes お (o-) and ご (go-) are often added to nouns to show politeness or respect.

- お (o-) is generally used with native Japanese words
  Example: **名前** (namae) → **お名前** (o-namae) "name"

- ご (go-) is generally used with Sino-Japanese words
  Example: **家族** (kazoku) → **ご家族** (go-kazoku) "family"

## Sentence-final Particles

Japanese uses various sentence-final particles to express the speaker's attitude or emotion. Some common ones include:

- ね (ne) - seeking agreement or confirmation
  **いい天気ですね。**
  (Ii tenki desu ne.)
  [iː teŋki desɯ ne]
  "It's nice weather, isn't it?"

  **日本語を勉強していますか。**
  (Nihongo o benkyō shite imasu ka.)
  [nihongo o beŋkʲoː shite imasɯ ka]
  "Are you studying Japanese?"

- な (na) - mild emphasis (casual)
  **美味しいな。**
  (Oishii na.)
  [oishiː na]
  "This is delicious."

## Counters

Japanese uses a complex system of counters when counting objects. Different counters are used depending on the shape, size, or category of the item being counted. Some common counters include:

- つ (-tsu) - general counter for small objects
  **りんごを三つ買いました。**
  (Ringo o mittsu kaimashita.)
  [ɾiŋgo o mittsɯ kaimashita]
  "I bought three apples."

## Onomatopoeia and Mimetic Words

Japanese has a rich vocabulary of onomatopoeia and mimetic words, known as 擬音語 (giongo) and 擬態語 (gitaigo). These words are used to vividly describe sounds, actions, emotions, and states.

Examples:

These words are often used in everyday conversation and writing to add expressiveness:

**雨がザーザー降っています。**
(Ame ga zā-zā futte imasu.)
[ame ga zaːzaː ɸɯtte imasɯ]
"It's raining heavily." (literally: "Rain is falling zā-zā")

## Loanwords

Japanese has borrowed many words from other languages, particularly English in recent times. These loanwords, called 外来語 (gairaigo), are usually written in katakana.

Examples:
- コンピューター (konpyūtā) - computer
- アイスクリーム (aisukurīmu) - ice cream
- スマートフォン (sumātofon) - smartphone

Sometimes, these loanwords are abbreviated:
- パソコン (pasokon) - personal computer (パーソナル・コンピューター)
