# Somali

Somali (Af Soomaali) is a Cushitic language spoken by approximately 16 million people, primarily in Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya. It belongs to the Afroasiatic language family and is the official language of Somalia. Somali has been written using various scripts throughout its history, including an indigenous script called Osmanya, but since 1972, it has officially used the Latin alphabet.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Somali has 22 consonant phonemes:

| Manner | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Retroflex | Palatal | Velar | Uvular | Glottal |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|-----------|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| Plosive | b | d̪ | d | ɖ |  | k | q | ʔ |
| Nasal | m | n̪ | n |  |  |  |  |  |
| Trill |  |  | r |  |  |  |  |  |
| Fricative |  |  | s | ʃ |  | x | χ | h |
| Approximant | w |  | l |  | j |  |  |  |

Some notable features:
- The dental consonants /d̪/ and /n̪/ are pronounced with the tongue touching the back of the upper teeth. These sounds are distinct from their alveolar counterparts /d/ and /n/.
- The retroflex /ɖ/ is pronounced with the tongue curled back. This sound is often challenging for non-native speakers to produce correctly.
- The uvular consonants /q/ and /χ/ are pronounced further back in the throat than their velar counterparts. These sounds are common in many Afroasiatic languages and can be difficult for speakers of languages without these phonemes.
- The glottal stop /ʔ/ is a consonant produced by closing the vocal cords. It's represented in writing by an apostrophe.

Examples of minimal pairs showcasing consonant distinctions:
- **baraf** (ice) vs. **faraf** (branch)
- **dar** (touch) vs. **ɖar** (narrowness)
- **kab** (shoe) vs. **qab** (hold)

### Vowels

Somali has 5 vowel qualities, each with a phonemic length distinction:

| | Front | Central | Back |
|-|-------|---------|------|
| Close | i, iː |  | u, uː |
| Mid | e, eː |  | o, oː |
| Open |  | a, aː |  |

The length distinction in vowels is crucial in Somali, as it can change the meaning of words. Here are some examples:

- **bir** [bir] (iron) vs. **biir** [biːr] (well)
- **deg** [deg] (burn) vs. **deeg** [deːg] (plateau)
- **laf** [laf] (bone) vs. **laaf** [laːf] (weakness)
- **hog** [hog] (lead) vs. **hoog** [hoːg] (drought)
- **tuk** [tuk] (crow) vs. **tuuk** [tuːk] (shoulder)

### Tone

Somali is a tonal language with high and low tones. Tone can distinguish both lexical and grammatical meanings. This tonal system is complex and interacts with stress and vowel length.

Lexical tone distinctions:
- **ínan** (boy) vs. **inán** (girl)
- **béer** (liver) vs. **beér** (garden)
- **gées** (side) vs. **geés** (brave person)

Grammatical tone distinctions:
- **náag** (woman) vs. **naág** (the woman)
- **albaáb** (door) vs. **álbaab** (doors)

Tone patterns can also indicate grammatical features such as case, gender, and number. For example:
- **ínan** (boy, absolutive case) vs. **inán** (boy, nominative case)
- **gúri** (house, masculine) vs. **gurí** (house, feminine)

It's important to note that tone is not marked in the standard orthography, which can lead to ambiguity in written texts. Context usually helps to disambiguate such cases.

### Phonotactics

Somali syllable structure is generally (C)V(V)(C). Consonant clusters are not allowed in native words, though they may occur in loanwords. The possible syllable structures are:

- V: **a** (and)
- CV: **ka** (from)
- VC: **ab** (half)
- CVC: **bar** (teach)
- VV: **ii** (to me)
- CVV: **gee** (take)
- CVVC: **beer** (garden)

Examples of words with different syllable structures:
- **ka** (from)
- **aan** (I)
- **qor** (write)
- **qaad** (take)
- **koob** (cup)
- **daaqad** (window)

In loanwords, consonant clusters may be preserved or broken up with epenthetic vowels:
- **istiraatiijiyadda** (strategy, from English)
- **buluug** (blue, from English)

### Phonological Processes

Several phonological processes occur in Somali:

1. Assimilation: Consonants often assimilate in voicing or place of articulation to adjacent consonants.
   Example: **san** + **bo** → **sambo** (fifty)

2. Vowel harmony: In some dialects, vowels in suffixes harmonize with the vowels in the root.
   Example: **guri** (house) + **-kayga** (my) → **gurigayga** (my house)

3. Consonant gradation: Some consonants alternate between strong and weak forms in certain grammatical contexts.
   Example: **af** (mouth) → **afka** (the mouth)

4. Vowel elision: In rapid speech, vowels may be elided between consonants.
   Example: **waxaan** → **waxan** (I/we)

## Orthography

Somali uses a Latin-based alphabet, officially adopted in 1972. The alphabet consists of 26 letters:

**A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z**

Some letters represent sounds different from their typical values in English:

- **C** represents the pharyngeal fricative /ʕ/
- **X** represents the voiceless pharyngeal fricative /ħ/
- **'** (apostrophe) represents the glottal stop /ʔ/

Long vowels are represented by doubling the vowel letter:

- **aa** /aː/
- **ee** /eː/
- **ii** /iː/
- **oo** /oː/
- **uu** /uː/

Examples of words with long vowels:
- **baan** (open space)
- **dheer** (long)
- **liid** (ash)
- **door** (turn)
- **suug** (wait)

Tone is not marked in the standard orthography, which can sometimes lead to ambiguity. Context usually helps to resolve such ambiguities in written text.

Some digraphs are used to represent single sounds:
- **dh** represents the retroflex /ɖ/
- **kh** represents the uvular fricative /χ/
- **sh** represents the palatal fricative /ʃ/

Examples:
- **dheg** (ear)
- **khatar** (danger)
- **shimbir** (bird)

## Morphology

Somali is an agglutinative language with a rich morphological system. Words are formed by adding affixes to roots, and these affixes carry grammatical information such as case, number, gender, tense, and aspect.

### Nouns

Nouns in Somali are marked for gender, number, and case.

#### Gender

Somali has two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. Gender is not always predictable from the form of the noun, but there are some patterns:

- Nouns ending in -e are usually feminine: **gabadhé** (girl), **hooyadé** (mother)
- Nouns ending in -o are usually masculine: **áabo** (father), **ílo** (spring)

Some nouns can change gender based on their meaning:
- **walaál** (sibling): masculine when referring to a brother, feminine when referring to a sister

Gender affects agreement with adjectives, verbs, and determiners:
- **nin weyn** (big man)
- **naag weyn** (big woman)

#### Number

Somali has singular and plural forms. Plural formation is complex, with several patterns:

1. Suffix -o:
   **buug** (book) → **buug-o** (books)
   **kursi** (chair) → **kursi-yo** (chairs)

2. Suffix -yaal:
   **macallin** (teacher) → **macallimiin-yaal** (teachers)
   **askari** (soldier) → **askar-yaal** (soldiers)

3. Broken plurals (internal vowel changes):
   **naag** (woman) → **naago** (women)
   **miis** (table) → **miisas** (tables)
   **geed** (tree) → **geedo** (trees)

4. Reduplication:
   **gabar** (girl) → **gabdho** (girls)
   **wiil** (boy) → **wiilal** (boys)

5. Irregular plurals:
   **il** (eye) → **indho** (eyes)
   **af** (mouth) → **afaf** (mouths)

Some nouns have multiple plural forms with different meanings:
- **magaalo** (town): **magaalooyin** (towns), **magaalooyinka** (the towns)

#### Case

Somali has four cases: absolutive, nominative, genitive, and vocative. Case is often marked by tone changes or suffixes.

1. Absolutive (unmarked): Used for the subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive verbs
   **naag** (a woman)
   **Naagi waa timid** (A woman came)

2. Nominative: Used for the subject of transitive verbs
   **naági** (the woman, as subject)
   **Naági baa cunto cuntay** (The woman ate food)

3. Genitive: Used to show possession
   **naagta** (of the woman)
   **guriga naagta** (the woman's house)

4. Vocative: Used for direct address
   **naagyahay** (O woman!)
   **Naagyahay, kaalay halkan!** (O woman, come here!)

Case marking can interact with definiteness and focus:
- **nin** (a man, absolutive)
- **ninka** (the man, absolutive)
- **ninku** (the man, nominative)

### Pronouns

Somali has a complex system of pronouns that encode person, number, gender, and case.

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | **aan** (I) | **annaga** (we, exclusive)<br>**innaga** (we, inclusive) |
| 2nd    | **adigu** (you) | **idinka** (you all) |
| 3rd    | **isagu** (he)<br>**iyadu** (she) | **iyaga** (they) |

These pronouns change form based on their grammatical function:

- Subject pronouns: **Aniga waan tegayaa** (I am going)
- Object pronouns: **Isagu i arkay** (He saw me)
- Possessive pronouns: **Gurigayga** (my house)

Possessive pronouns are formed by adding suffixes to nouns:

- **gurigayga** (my house)
- **gurigaaga** (your house)
- **gurigeeda** (her house)
- **gurigiisa** (his house)
- **gurigeenna** (our house)
- **gurigiinna** (your (pl.) house)
- **gurigooda** (their house)

Demonstrative pronouns:
- **kan** (this, masculine)
- **tan** (this, feminine)
- **kuwan** (these)
- **kaas** (that, masculine)
- **taas** (that, feminine)
- **kuwaas** (those)

Relative pronouns:
- **oo**: **Ninkii oo guriga tegay** (The man who went to the house)

Interrogative pronouns:
- **kuma** (who)
- **maxaa** (what)
- **kee** (which)

### Verbs

Somali verbs are highly complex, with many derived forms and inflections for tense, aspect, mood, and agreement.

#### Verb Roots

Most Somali verb roots are monosyllabic:

- **qor** (write)
- **cun** (eat)
- **jeer** (turn)
- **tag** (go)
- **kar** (cook)

#### Inflection

Verbs inflect for person, number, tense, and mood. Here's an example with the verb **qor** (write):

Present tense:
- **waan qoraa** (I write)
- **waad qortaa** (you write)
- **wuu qoraa** (he writes)
- **way qortaa** (she writes)
- **waan qornaa** (we write)
- **waad qortaan** (you all write)
- **way qoraan** (they write)

Past tense:
- **waan qoray** (I wrote)
- **waad qortay** (you wrote)
- **wuu qoray** (he wrote)
- **way qortay** (she wrote)
- **waan qornay** (we wrote)
- **waad qorteen** (you all wrote)
- **way qoreen** (they wrote)

Future tense is formed using the auxiliary verb **doon**:
- **waan qori doonaa** (I will write)
- **waad qori doontaa** (you will write)

Progressive aspect is formed using the auxiliary verb **jiir**:
- **waan qorayayaa** (I am writing)
- **waad qoraysaa** (you are writing)

Habitual aspect uses the suffix -aa:
- **waan qoraa** (I write, habitually)

Subjunctive mood is used for wishes, commands, and hypothetical situations:
- **aan qoro** (let me write)
- **ha qorto** (may he/she write)

#### Derived Forms

Somali has several derived verb forms that change the meaning or valency of the verb:

1. Causative: add -i-
   **qor** (write) → **qori** (make write)
   **cun** (eat) → **cuni** (feed)

2. Autobenefactive: add -o-
   **qor** (write) → **qoro** (write for oneself)
   **iibso** (buy for oneself) from **iib** (sell)

3. Passive: add -m-
   **qor** (write) → **qorm** (be written)
   **dil** (kill) → **dilm** (be killed)

4. Reciprocal: add -oon-
   **gacan** (help) → **gargaaroon** (help each other)
   **dagaal** (fight) → **dagaaloon** (fight each other)

5. Intensive: reduplication or gemination
   **qor** (write) → **qorqor** (write intensively)
   **jar** (cut) → **jarjar** (cut into pieces)

These derived forms can be combined to create complex verb meanings:
**cunsiiyey** (he made someone feed something to someone else)
from **cun** (eat) + causative + causative + past tense

#### Verb-Subject Agreement

Verbs agree with their subjects in person and number:
- **Aniga waan tagayaa** (I am going)
- **Iyadu way tagaysaa** (She is going)
- **Iyaga waytagayaan** (They are going)

This agreement is often reflected in the verb endings and the focus markers (like **waa**, **baa**, etc.) that accompany the verb.

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Somali agree with the noun they modify in gender and number:

- **naag weyn** (big woman)
- **naago waaweyn** (big women)
- **nin weyn** (big man)
- **niman waaweyn** (big men)

Adjectives can also function as stative verbs:

- **Ninku waa weyn yahay** (The man is big)
- **Naagtu waa weyn tahay** (The woman is big)

Comparatives are formed using the word **ka** (than):
- **Cali waa ka dheer yahay Maryam** (Ali is taller than Maryam)

Superlatives use **ugu** before the adjective:
- **Cali waa ugu dheer yahay fasalka** (Ali is the tallest in the class)

Some common adjectives:
- **weyn** (big)
- **yar** (small)
- **cad** (white)
- **madow** (black)
- **cusub** (new)
- **gaaban** (short)
- **dheer** (long, tall)

### Numbers

Cardinal numbers in Somali:

1. **kow**
2. **laba**
3. **saddex**
4. **afar**
5. **shan**
6. **lix**
7. **toddoba**
8. **siddeed**
9. **sagaal**
10. **toban**

Numbers 11-19 are formed by adding **iyo** (and) between the units and ten:
- 11: **kow iyo toban**
- 15: **shan iyo toban**
- 19: **sagaal iyo toban**

Multiples of ten use the suffix -aatan:
- 20: **labaatan**
- 30: **soddon**
- 40: **afartan**
- 50: **konton**
- 60: **lixdan**
- 70: **toddobaatan**
- 80: **siddeetan**
- 90: **sagaashan**
- 100: **boqol**

For numbers between multiples of ten, **iyo** is used:
- 25: **shan iyo labaatan**
- 38: **siddeed iyo soddon**
- 72: **laba iyo toddobaatan**

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding the suffix -aad to the cardinal number:
- first: **kowaad**
- second: **labaad**
- third: **saddexaad**

Numbers agree with nouns in case and definiteness:
- **laba nin** (two men)
- **labada nin** (the two men)
- **saddex naagood** (three women)

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Somali is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb):

**Cali baa rooti cunay**
Ali FOC bread ate
"Ali ate bread"

However, Somali also uses focus particles (like **baa** in the example above) that can change the word order for emphasis. The focused element typically comes first in the sentence.

### Focus System

Somali has a complex focus system that interacts with word order and verbal morphology. The main focus particles are:

- **baa**: subject focus
- **ayaa**: subject or object focus
- **waa**: verb focus or neutral statement
- **waxaa**: cleft sentences

Examples:
- **Cali baa tegay** (It was Ali who went)
- **Cali ayaa tegay** (Ali went - emphasizing Ali)
- **Cali waa tegay** (Ali went - neutral statement)
- **Waxaa tegay Cali** (The one who went was Ali)

These focus particles play a crucial role in Somali syntax and information structure. They often replace case markers and can affect the form of the verb.

### Negation

Negation is expressed using the particle **ma** for declarative sentences and **ha** for imperatives:

- **Ma iman doono** (I will not come)
- **Cali ma tegin** (Ali did not go)
- **Ha tegin** (Don't go)

In past tense negations, the verb takes a special negative form:
- **ma tegín** (I/you/he/she did not go)
- **ma tegnín** (we/you/they did not go)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by using the particle **ma**:

- **Ma tegaysaa?** (Are you going?)
- **Ma cuntay cuntada?** (Did you eat the food?)

Wh-questions use question words like:
- **maxaa** (what)
- **xaggee** (where)
- **goorma** (when)
- **sidee** (how)
- **immisa** (how many)

Examples:
**Xaggee baad tegaysaa?**
Where FOC-you going
"Where are you going?"

**Maxay samaysay Maryam?**
What-she did Maryam
"What did Maryam do?"

### Subordinate Clauses

Relative clauses in Somali use the particle **oo**:

**Ninkii oo guriga tegay**
The-man who house-the went
"The man who went to the house"

**Gabadha aan la hadlay**
The-girl I with spoke
"The girl I spoke with"

Conditional clauses use **haddii** (if):

**Haddii ay roobto, ma tegi doono**
If it rains, NEG go will-I
"If it rains, I will not go"

Temporal clauses often use **markii** (when):

**Markii aan imid, way seexatay**
When I came, she-FOC slept
"When I came, she was sleeping"

Purpose clauses use **si** (so that):

**Waxaan u tegey si aan u arko**
I-FOC to went so-that I to see
"I went in order to see"

### Coordination

Coordination is achieved using conjunctions such as:

- **iyo** (and): **wiil iyo gabadh** (a boy and a girl)
- **ama** (or): **shaah ama qaxwo** (tea or coffee)
- **laakiin** (but): **waa weyn yahay laakiin waa gaaban tahay** (he is big but she is short)

### Comparison

Comparatives use **ka** (than):

**Cali waa ka dheer yahay Maryam**
Ali FOC than tall is Maryam
"Ali is taller than Maryam"

Superlatives use **ugu** before the adjective:

**Cali waa ugu dheer yahay fasalka**
Ali FOC most tall is class-the
"Ali is the tallest in the class"

### Possessive Constructions

Possession is indicated by word order in Somali, with the possessor preceding the possessed:

**guriga Cali**
house-the Ali
"Ali's house"

For pronominal possession, suffixes are used:

**gurigayga** (my house)
**gurigaaga** (your house)
**gurigiisa** (his house)
**gurigeeda** (her house)

### Verb Serialization

Somali allows for verb serialization, where multiple verbs are used in sequence to describe a complex action:

**Wuu kacay tegey**
He-FOC got-up went
"He got up and left"

## Lexicon

Somali vocabulary is primarily Cushitic in origin, but has borrowed words from Arabic, Italian, and English due to historical and cultural influences.

### Arabic Loanwords

Many Arabic loanwords are related to religion, commerce, and administration:

- **kitaab** (book) from Arabic كتاب
- **suuq** (market) from Arabic سوق
- **macallin** (teacher) from Arabic معلم
- **xisaab** (mathematics) from Arabic حساب
- **waqti** (time) from Arabic وقت
- **magaalo** (city) from Arabic محلة

### Italian Loanwords

Italian loanwords often relate to modern concepts and technology:

- **baasto** (pasta) from Italian "pasta"
- **kumbuyuutar** (computer) from Italian "computer"
- **baaskiil** (bicycle) from Italian "bicicletta"
- **boorsó** (purse) from Italian "borsa"
- **kaamero** (camera) from Italian "camera"

### English Loanwords

Recent English loanwords are common in technology and pop culture:

- **mobayil** (mobile phone)
- **internet** (internet)
- **Facebook** (Facebook)
- **tilifoon** (telephone)
- **raadiye** (radio)

### Word Formation

Somali uses several methods for word formation:

1. Compounding:
   **af** (mouth) + **maay** (soft) → **af-maay** (Maay dialect of Somali)
   **bir** (iron) + **qalam** (pen) → **birqalam** (pencil)

2. Derivation:
   **qor** (write) → **qoraal** (writing, text)
   **xisaab** (mathematics) → **xisaabiye** (accountant)

3. Reduplication:
   **yar** (small) → **yaryar** (very small)
   **dheer** (long) → **dheerdheer** (very long)

4. Conversion:
   Many words can function as different parts of speech without changing form:
   **qor** as a noun means "back", as a verb means "write"

## Dialectology

Somali has several dialects, with the main division being between Northern and Southern dialects:

1. Northern dialects:
   - Northern Somali (the basis for standard Somali)
   - Benaadir

2. Southern dialects:
   - Maay
   - Digil

The differences between dialects are mainly in pronunciation and vocabulary, with some grammatical variations. For example:

- Northern: **aniga** (I/me)
- Southern Maay: **ani**

- Northern: **wuu tegay** (he went)
- Southern Maay: **uu ṯegey**

The Northern dialect, particularly the variety spoken in Mudug, forms the basis of standard Somali. However, the Maay dialect is significantly different and is sometimes considered a separate language.

## Idiomatic Expressions

Somali has many colorful idiomatic expressions:

- **Ilaahay ha ku siiyo calool adayg**
  (May God give you a strong stomach)
  Meaning: Be patient / Have courage

- **Af daboolan waa dahab**
  (A closed mouth is gold)
  Meaning: Similar to "Silence is golden"

- **Gacmo wadajir baa wax ku gooya**
  (Hands working together can cut through anything)
  Meaning: Unity is strength

- **Aqoon la'aan waa iftiin la'aan**
  (Lack of knowledge is lack of light)
  Meaning: Education is important

- **Nin aad taqaan iyo tuug aadan aqoon midna ha rumaysan**
  (Don't trust a man you know or a thief you don't know)
  Meaning: Be cautious in your dealings with others

## Colloquial Language

Colloquial Somali differs from the standard language in several ways:

1. Contraction of pronouns:
   Standard: **waan tagayaa** (I am going)
   Colloquial: **wan tagayaa**

2. Dropping of final consonants:
   Standard: **waxaan** (I/we)
   Colloquial: **waxaa**

3. Use of slang terms:
   Standard: **saaxiib** (friend)
   Colloquial: **jaalle**

4. Code-switching with English or Arabic, especially among young urban speakers:
   **Waan ku call garaynayaa later**
   (I will call you later)

5. Shortened forms of common phrases:
   Standard: **ma ogtahay** (do you know)
   Colloquial: **mooyee**

6. Use of filler words:
   **walaahi** (by God) is often used as a filler or to emphasize a point

7. Informal greetings:
   Standard: **Nabad ma?** (How are you?)
   Colloquial: **Iska waran?** (What's up?)

This overview covers the main features of the Somali language, providing a comprehensive look at its phonology, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary. The examples and details should give learners and laymen a solid understanding of the language's structure and use.
