# Romansh

Romansh (Rumantsch) is a Romance language spoken primarily in the Swiss canton of Grisons (Graubünden). It is one of Switzerland's four national languages, alongside German, French, and Italian. Romansh is descended from spoken Latin and has been influenced by German and Italian over the centuries.

There are approximately 60,000 Romansh speakers, most of whom are bilingual in German. Romansh is notable for having five main regional varieties, each with its own written standard:

1. Sursilvan
2. Sutsilvan
3. Surmiran
4. Puter
5. Vallader

In addition to these regional varieties, there is a standardized written form called Rumantsch Grischun, created in 1982 to serve as a pan-regional written language for official purposes.

## Phonology and Orthography

Romansh phonology varies somewhat between the different regional varieties. The following description focuses on the most common features, with notes on significant variations.

### Vowels

Romansh has a rich vowel system, including both oral and nasal vowels in some varieties.

- Some words have irregular stress, often marked with an accent:
  **cafè** [kaˈfɛ] (coffee)

### Differences between varieties

The five main Romansh varieties have some phonological differences:

- Sursilvan and Sutsilvan tend to retain Latin -A as **-a**, while the other varieties change it to **-e**:
  Sursilvan **casa** vs. Vallader **chasa** (house)
- Puter and Vallader have the sound [y] (written ü), which is not present in the other varieties:
  Puter **lüna** vs. Sursilvan **glina** (moon)
- The pronunciation of 'house' varies significantly:
  Sursilvan **casa** [ˈkaza], Sutsilvan **tgea** [tʃea], Surmiran **tgesa** [ˈtʃeza], Puter/Vallader **chasa** [ˈxaza] or [ˈkaza]

## Morphology

### Nouns

Romansh nouns have two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural). The plural is generally formed by adding -s or -as to the singular form.

### Verbs

Romansh verbs are conjugated for person, number, tense, and mood. There are three main conjugation classes, based on the infinitive endings: -ar, -er, and -ir.

Present tense of regular verbs:

| | chantar (to sing) | vender (to sell) | dormir (to sleep) |
|-|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|

#### Tenses

Romansh has several tenses, including:

1. Present: **Jau chant.** (I sing.)
2. Imperfect: **Jau chantava.** (I was singing.)
3. Perfect: **Jau hai chantà.** (I have sung.)
4. Pluperfect: **Jau aveva chantà.** (I had sung.)
5. Future: **Jau chantarai.** (I will sing.)
6. Conditional: **Jau chantass.** (I would sing.)

#### Moods

Romansh has several moods, including:

1. Indicative (used for factual statements)
2. Subjunctive (used for hypothetical or uncertain situations)
3. Imperative (used for commands)

Example of subjunctive:
- **Sche jau avess daners, cumprassi in auto.** (If I had money, I would buy a car.)

Example of imperative:
- **Chanta!** (Sing!)
- **Durmì!** (Sleep!)

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Romansh is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):

**Jau ves il chaun.** (I see the dog.)

However, like other Romance languages, Romansh allows for some flexibility in word order for emphasis or stylistic reasons.

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by inverting the subject and verb:

**Ves ti il chaun?** (Do you see the dog?)

Wh-questions use interrogative words at the beginning of the sentence:

**Tge fas ti?** (What are you doing?)
**Nua vas ti?** (Where are you going?)

### Negation

Negation is typically formed using the particle **na** before the verb:

**Jau na chant betg.** (I do not sing.)

In some varieties, especially in colloquial speech, **na** can be omitted:

**Jau chant betg.** (I don't sing.)

### Reflexive Verbs

Reflexive verbs use reflexive pronouns:

**Jau ma lav.** (I wash myself.)
**Nus ans vestgain.** (We dress ourselves.)

### Passive Voice

The passive voice is formed using the auxiliary verb **vegnir** (to come) or **esser** (to be) plus the past participle:

**Il cudesch vegn legì.** (The book is being read.)
**La chasa è vegnida vendida.** (The house has been sold.)

## Dialectal Variations

As mentioned earlier, Romansh has five main regional varieties. Here are some key differences between them:

### Sursilvan

Spoken in the Surselva region, this is the most widely used variety.

Characteristics:
- Retains Latin final -A: **casa** (house)
- Uses **tgei** for "what": **Tgei fas ti?** (What are you doing?)
- "To be" in present tense: **jeu sun, ti eis, el/ella ei, nus essan, vus essas, els/ellas ein**

### Sutsilvan

Spoken in the Schons Valley and parts of the Domleschg region.

Characteristics:
- Changes Latin final -A to -O: **tgeso** (house)
- Uses **tge** for "what": **Tge fas te?** (What are you doing?)
- "To be" in present tense: **jou sunt, tei eist, el/ella ei, nous ischan, vous ischas, els/ellas ein**

### Surmiran

Spoken in the Surses region.

Characteristics:
- Changes Latin final -A to -A or -E: **tgesa** (house)

### Rumantsch Grischun

This is the standardized written form created in 1982 to serve as a compromise between the different varieties. It's used for official purposes and in some media, but it's not spoken as a native language.

Characteristics:
- Tends to choose forms that are common to most varieties or represent a compromise between them
- Uses **tge** for "what": **Tge fas ti?** (What are you doing?)
- "To be" in present tense: **jau sun, ti es, el/ella è, nus essan, vus essas, els/ellas èn**

## Grammar Peculiarities

### Dual Number

Sursilvan retains a vestigial dual number for some words, a feature rare in Romance languages:

- **nus** (we, general plural)
- **nus dus** (we two, dual)

### Prepositional Article Contractions

Like many Romance languages, Romansh contracts certain prepositions with articles:

- **da** + **il** = **dil** (of the, masculine singular)
- **da** + **la** = **dalla** (of the, feminine singular)
- **en** + **il** = **el** (in the, masculine singular)
- **en** + **la** = **ella** (in the, feminine singular)

### Partitive Article

Romansh uses a partitive article similar to French:

- **Jau hai cumprà dal paun.** (I bought some bread.)

### Diminutives and Augmentatives

Romansh has a rich system of diminutives and augmentatives:

- **chat** (cat) → **chattin** (kitten)
- **chasa** (house) → **chasuna** (big house)

### Gerund

The gerund in Romansh is formed by adding -nd to the verb stem:

- **chantar** (to sing) → **chantand** (singing)
- **vender** (to sell) → **vendend** (selling)

Example: **El va chantand per via.** (He goes singing along the way.)

### Conditional Perfect

Romansh has a conditional perfect tense, used for hypothetical situations in the past:

- **Sche jau avess savì, avess jau fatg auter.** (If I had known, I would have done differently.)

### Pluperfect Subjunctive

The pluperfect subjunctive is used in contrary-to-fact conditions in the past:

- **Sche ti avessas studegià, avessas ti reussì l'examen.** (If you had studied, you would have passed the exam.)

## Idiomatic Expressions

Romansh has many idiomatic expressions, often reflecting its Alpine environment and rural history:

- **Avair il tgau en las nivlas** (To have one's head in the clouds)
- **Esser sco tschunc e set** (To be like five and seven - to be at odds)
- **Far ora il tschiel blau** (To make out the blue sky - to exaggerate)
- **Avair nagin sal en la scadiola** (To have no salt in the skull - to be stupid)
- **Esser sut tetg** (To be under roof - to be married)

## Word Formation

Romansh has several ways of forming new words:

### Prefixes

- **mal-**: indicates badness or wrongness
  **saun** (healthy) → **malsaun** (sick)

- **re-**: indicates repetition
  **far** (to do) → **refar** (to redo)

### Suffixes

- **-adur**: forms agent nouns
  **chantar** (to sing) → **chantadur** (singer)

- **-aivel**: forms adjectives
  **vender** (to sell) → **vendaivel** (saleable)

### Compound Words

Romansh can form compound words, often with a linking -s-:

- **chasa** (house) + **porta** (door) = **chasaporta** (front door)
- **fim** (smoke) + **tiba** (pipe) = **fimstiba** (chimney)

## Loanwords

While Romansh has many native words, it has also borrowed from neighboring languages:

From German:
- **schnitzel** → **schnitzel**
- **Rucksack** → **rucsac**

From Italian:
- **cappuccino** → **cappuccino**
- **pizza** → **pizza**

From English (more recent):
- **computer** → **computer**
- **football** → **football**

## Text Sample

Here's a sample text in Rumantsch Grischun with an English translation:

**La Vuolp e la Cicogna**

**Ina vuolp aveva envidà ina cicogna per tschaina. La tschaina è vegnida servida sin in taglier plat, e la povra cicogna cun ses pichel lung n'ha strusch pudì gustar insatge, entant che la vuolp ha litgà si tut en in batter d'egl. Per render la pareiglia, la cicogna ha envidà la vuolp per tschaina il di suenter. Ella ha servì la supa en in vaider cun in culiez lung e stret, uschia che la vuolp ha mo pudì litgar la surfatscha, entant che la cicogna cun ses pichel lung ha pudì mangiar tut.**

**La morala: Betg far als auters quai che ti na vuls betg ch'ins fetschia cun tai!**

Translation:

"The Fox and the Stork"

"A fox had invited a stork for dinner. The dinner was served on a flat plate, and the poor stork with its long beak could hardly taste anything, while the fox licked up everything in the blink of an eye. To return the favor, the stork invited the fox for dinner the next day. She served the soup in a glass with a long and narrow neck, so that the fox could only lick the surface, while the stork with her long beak could eat everything."

"The moral: Don't do to others what you don't want done to you!"

This text demonstrates several features of Romansh, including its vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. It also shows how Romansh, like many languages, uses animal fables to convey moral lessons.
