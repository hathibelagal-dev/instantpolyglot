# Norwegian Bokmål

Norwegian is a North Germanic language spoken primarily in Norway by about 5 million people. It belongs to the Scandinavian branch of the Germanic languages, closely related to Danish and Swedish. A key feature of Norwegian is its flexibility in written and spoken forms.

## Writing Systems

Norwegian has two official written standards:

1. Bokmål (Book Language): Used by the majority (85-90%) of Norwegians.
2. Nynorsk (New Norwegian): Used by a minority (10-15%), mainly in western Norway.

This overview will focus primarily on Bokmål, while noting some Nynorsk variations where relevant.

## Alphabet and Pronunciation

Norwegian uses the Latin alphabet with 29 letters:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Æ Ø Å

The letters C, Q, W, X, and Z are only used in loanwords and names.

### Vowels

Norwegian has 9 vowel phonemes, which can be short or long:

| Letter | Short sound | Long sound | Example |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------|
| A, a | [ɑ] | [ɑː] | **kant** [kɑnt] (edge), **kake** [ˈkɑːkə] (cake) |
| E, e | [ɛ] | [eː] | **hekk** [hɛk] (hedge), **lese** [ˈleːsə] (read) |

| T, t | [t] | **tid** [tiː] (time) |
| V, v | [ʋ] | **vann** [ʋɑn] (water) |

Note: The pronunciation of 'r' can vary significantly between dialects, from the alveolar flap [ɾ] to a uvular trill [ʀ] or approximant [ʁ].

### Consonant clusters and special sounds

1. Retroflex consonants:
   When /r/ is followed by /d/, /l/, /n/, /s/, or /t/, they often form retroflex consonants in Eastern Norwegian:
   - rd [ɖ]: **hard** [hɑːɖ] (hard)
   - rl [ɭ]: **perle** [ˈpæːɭə] (pearl)
   - rn [ɳ]: **barn** [bɑːɳ] (child)
   - rs [ʂ]: **vers** [ʋæʂ] (verse)
   - rt [ʈ]: **svart** [sʋɑʈ] (black)

   Note: These retroflex sounds are not used in all dialects.

2. The "sj" sound [ʃ]:
   - **sj**: **sjø** [ʃøː] (sea)
   - **skj**: **skjære** [ˈʃæːɾə] (magpie)
   - **sk** before front vowels: **ski** [ʃiː] (ski)

3. The "kj" sound [ç]:
   - **kj**: **kjøpe** [ˈçøːpə] (buy)
   - **tj**: **tjue** [ˈçʉːə] (twenty)
   - **k** before front vowels: **kino** [ˈçiːnu] (cinema)

   Note: In some dialects and among younger speakers, the [ç] sound is merging with [ʃ].

4. The "ng" sound [ŋ]:
   - **ng**: **sang** [sɑŋ] (song)
   - **nk**: **tanke** [ˈtɑŋkə] (thought)

### Stress

Stress in Norwegian words is typically on the first syllable:
- **arbeid** [ˈɑɾbɛid] (work)
- **vinter** [ˈʋɪntəɾ] (winter)

Exceptions include:
- Many loanwords: **banan** [bɑˈnɑːn] (banana)
- Words with certain prefixes: **betale** [bəˈtɑːlə] (pay)

### Tone

Norwegian is a tonal language with two distinct pitch accents, often called Tone 1 and Tone 2. This feature is known as toneme and can distinguish between otherwise identical words:

- Tone 1 (falling): **bønder** [ˈbønəɾ˥˩] (farmers)
- Tone 2 (rising-falling): **bønner** [ˈbønəɾ˩˥˩] (beans)

The tonal distinction is not represented in the written language and varies between dialects. Some dialects, particularly in Western Norway, do not use tonal distinctions.

## Morphology

### Nouns

Bokmål Norwegian has a flexible gender system, allowing for both a three-gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and a two-gender (common, neuter) approach:

Three-gender system:

| Gender | Indefinite sg. | Definite sg. | Indefinite pl. | Definite pl. |
|--------|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| Masculine | en bil (a car) | bilen (the car) | biler (cars) | bilene (the cars) |
| Feminine | ei bok (a book) | boka (the book) | bøker (books) | bøkene (the books) |
| Neuter | et hus (a house) | huset (the house) | hus (houses) | husa/husene (the houses) |

Two-gender system:

| Gender | Indefinite sg. | Definite sg. | Indefinite pl. | Definite pl. |
|--------|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| Common | en bil (a car) | bilen (the car) | biler (cars) | bilene (the cars) |
| Common | en bok (a book) | boka/boken (the book) | bøker (books) | bøkene (the books) |
| Neuter | et hus (a house) | huset (the house) | hus (houses) | husa/husene (the houses) |

Many speakers and writers use a mixed system, treating some traditionally feminine nouns as masculine. The choice often depends on dialect, personal preference, or style.

Some nouns have irregular plurals:
- **mus** (mouse, fem.) → **mus** (mice)

### Adjectives

Adjectives agree with the noun they modify in gender, number, and definiteness:

| Gender | Indefinite sg. | Definite sg./pl. | Indefinite pl. |
|--------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Masc./Common | en **stor** bil (a big car) | den **store** bilen (the big car) | **store** biler (big cars) |
| Feminine | ei **stor** bok (a big book) | den **store** boka/boken (the big book) | **store** bøker (big books) |
| Neuter | et **stort** hus (a big house) | det **store** huset (the big house) | **store** hus (big houses) |

Comparative and superlative forms:
- Positive: **stor** (big)

## Syntax

### Word Order

Norwegian generally follows the SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order:

**Jeg leser ei/en bok** (I read a book)

In questions and subordinate clauses, the word order changes:

- Question: **Leser du ei/en bok?** (Are you reading a book?)
- Subordinate clause: **Jeg vet at du leser ei/en bok** (I know that you are reading a book)

### V2 Rule

Norwegian is a V2 language, meaning the finite verb must be the second element in main clauses:

**I dag leser jeg en ei/bok** (Today I am reading a book)

### Negation

The negation word **ikke** typically comes after the finite verb in main clauses:

**Jeg leser ikke ei/en bok** (I am not reading a book)

In subordinate clauses, **ikke** comes before the finite verb:

**Jeg veit/vet at du ikke leser ei/en bok** (I know that you are not reading a book)

### Question Formation

Yes/no questions are formed by inverting the subject and verb:

**Leser du ei/en bok?** (Are you reading a book?)

Wh-questions start with the question word, followed by the verb:

**Hva leser du?** (What are you reading?)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by the relative pronoun **som**:

**Mannen som står der er faren min** (The man who is standing there is my father)

### Conjunctions

Coordinating conjunctions:
- **og** (and)
- **men** (but)
- **eller** (or)

Subordinating conjunctions:
- **at** (that)
- **fordi** (because)
- **hvis** (if)

### Modal Verbs

Modal verbs are followed by the main verb in the infinitive form without **å**:

**Jeg kan snakke norsk** (I can speak Norwegian)

Common modal verbs:
- **kan** (can)
- **vil** (want)
- **må** (must)
- **skal** (shall)
- **bør** (should)

## Vocabulary

Norwegian vocabulary is primarily Germanic in origin, with significant influence from other languages:

1. Old Norse: The base of most Norwegian words
   Example: **hus** (house), **skip** (ship)

2. Low German: Due to Hanseatic influence
   Example: **arbeid** (work), **betale** (pay)

3. Danish: Due to the long union with Denmark
   Example: **betydning** (meaning), **forsøk** (attempt)

4. French: Mostly in cuisine and culture
   Example: **sjåfør** (chauffeur), **paraply** (umbrella)

5. English: Especially in modern and technical terms
   Example: **weekend** (weekend), **bacon** (bacon)

### Word Formation

Compound words are common in Norwegian:

- **togstasjon** (train station): **tog** (train) + **stasjon** (station)
- **arbeidsplass** (workplace): **arbeid** (work) + **plass** (place)

Prefixes and suffixes are used to form new words:

- Prefixes: **u-** (un-), **for-** (for-), **mis-** (mis-)
  Example: **uheldig** (unfortunate), **forsiktig** (careful), **misforstå** (misunderstand)

- Suffixes: **-lig** (-ly), **-het** (-ness), **-else** (-tion)
  Example: **vennlig** (friendly), **skjønnhet** (beauty), **følelse** (feeling)

## Dialects and Variation

Norwegian has a wide variety of dialects, which can differ significantly in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. Some major dialect groups include:

1. Eastern Norwegian (Østnorsk)
2. Western Norwegian (Vestnorsk)
3. Central Norwegian (Trøndersk)
4. Northern Norwegian (Nordnorsk)

These dialects can vary in features such as:

- Pronunciation of 'r' (trilled, uvular, or flapped)
- Use of retroflex consonants
- Vocabulary differences
- Grammatical structures (e.g., different verb conjugations or pronoun usage)

## Colloquial Norwegian

Spoken Norwegian often differs from the written standard. Some common features of colloquial Norwegian include:

2. Contraction of common phrases: **har ikke** → **hakke** (have not)
3. Use of English loanwords: **nice**, **chill**, **keen**
4. Slang expressions: **fett** (cool), **drit-** (very, extremely)

## Politeness and Formality

Norwegian society is generally informal, but there are still some politeness conventions:

1. The formal pronoun **De** (you) is rarely used.
2. **Du** (you) is the standard form of address for most situations.
3. Titles are rarely used; first names are common even in professional settings.
4. Politeness is often expressed through tone and use of modal verbs rather than specific polite forms.
