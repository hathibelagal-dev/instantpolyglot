# Vulgar Latin

Vulgar Latin refers to the nonstandard forms of Latin spoken by common people throughout the Roman Empire from roughly the 3rd century BCE to the 8th century CE. It existed alongside Classical Latin and eventually evolved into the various Romance languages. This vernacular form of Latin differed from the literary standard in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.

## Phonology

Vulgar Latin underwent significant sound changes compared to Classical Latin, laying the foundation for the phonological systems of Romance languages.

### Vowels

The Classical Latin vowel system consisted of ten vowels: five short (ă, ĕ, ĭ, ŏ, ŭ) and five long (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū). Vulgar Latin lost the distinction between long and short vowels, replacing it with a system based on vowel quality:

| Classical Latin | Vulgar Latin | Example |
|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| ă, ā | a [a] | **mare** [ˈmare] (sea) |
| ĕ, ē | e [e] | **terra** [ˈterra] (earth) |
| ĭ, ī | i [i] | **fīlius** > **filiu** [ˈfilju] (son) |
| ŏ, ō | o [o] | **bonus** [ˈbonus] (good) |
| ŭ, ū | u [u] | **lūna** > **luna** [ˈluna] (moon) |

Examples of vowel quality changes:
- **vĕnit** [ˈwenit] > **venit** [ˈvɛnit] (he comes)
- **dōnum** [ˈdoːnum] > **donu** [ˈdonu] (gift)

Additionally, Vulgar Latin developed new diphthongs:

1. [au̯] remained from Classical Latin: 
   - **aurum** [ˈau̯rum] (gold)
   - **paucum** [ˈpau̯kum] (little)

2. [ai̯] from AE: 
   - **caelum** [ˈkai̯lu] (sky)
   - **aetas** [ˈai̯tas] (age)

3. [oi̯] from OE: 
   - **poena** [ˈpoi̯na] (punishment)
   - **foedus** [ˈfoi̯dus] (treaty)

4. New diphthongs from vowel + [j]:
   - **filiu** [ˈfilju] (son)
   - **muliere** [muˈljere] (woman)

### Consonants

Significant consonant changes in Vulgar Latin included:

1. Loss of final -m:
   - Classical **rosam** [ˈrosam] > Vulgar **rosa** [ˈrosa] (rose, acc.)
   - **lupum** [ˈlupum] > **lupu** [ˈlupu] (wolf, acc.)

2. Palatalization of [k] and [g] before front vowels:
   - **caelum** [ˈkai̯lum] > [ˈtʃɛlo] (sky)
   - **gentem** [ˈgentem] > [ˈdʒɛnte] (people)
   - **civitatem** [kiwiˈtaːtem] > [tʃiviˈtate] (city)

3. Assimilation of consonant clusters:
   - **septem** [ˈseptem] > [ˈsɛtte] (seven)
   - **octo** [ˈokto] > [ˈotto] (eight)
   - **factum** [ˈfaktum] > [ˈfattu] (done)

4. Simplification of geminate consonants:
   - **annum** [ˈanːum] > [ˈanu] (year)
   - **terra** [ˈtɛrːa] > [ˈtɛra] (earth) in some dialects

5. Development of the glide [j]:
   - **video** [ˈwideɔː] > [ˈvɛdjo] (I see)
   - **iam** [jam] > [dʒa] (already)

6. Loss of [h]:
   - **habere** [haˈbeːre] > [aˈvere] (to have)
   - **homo** [ˈhɔmoː] > [ˈɔmu] (man)

7. Betacism: [w] > [β] > [v] in many regions:
   - **vivere** [ˈwiːwere] > [ˈvivere] (to live)
   - **novem** [ˈnɔwem] > [ˈnɔve] (nine)

8. Lenition of intervocalic stops in Western Romance:
   - **vita** [ˈwiːta] > [ˈviða] (life)
   - **ripa** [ˈriːpa] > [ˈriba] (riverbank)

### Stress

Vulgar Latin generally maintained the Classical Latin stress patterns:

1. Stress on the penultimate syllable if it's heavy (long vowel or closed syllable):
   - **a**.**mī**.cus > **a**.**mi**.**cu** (friend)
   - **per**.**fec**.tus > **per**.**fet**.**tu** (perfect)

2. Stress on the antepenultimate syllable if the penultimate is light:
   - **fē**.**mi**.na > **fe**.**mi**.na (woman)
   - **tá**.**bu**.la > **ta**.**vu**.la (table)

However, some changes occurred:

1. Loss of distinction between long and short vowels led to stress shifts in some words:
   - Classical **mulíerem** > Vulgar **mulíere** (woman, acc.)
   - **intégrum** > **íntegru** (entire)

2. Syncope could lead to stress shifts:
   - **cálidus** > **cáldu** (hot)
   - **víridis** > **vírde** (green)

3. Greek loanwords often retained their original stress:
   - **ecclésia** (church) instead of expected **eccle**.**si**.a

## Morphology

Vulgar Latin saw significant changes in its morphological system, moving from the highly inflected Classical Latin towards more analytic structures.

### Nouns

The case system was greatly simplified in Vulgar Latin. The Classical Latin six-case system (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, vocative) was reduced to a two-case system in most areas:

1. Subject case (derived from nominative)
2. Object case (derived from accusative)

Example with **lupus** (wolf):

| Case | Classical Latin | Vulgar Latin |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| Nominative | lupus | **lupu** |
| Accusative | lupum | **lupu** |
| Genitive | lupi | de **lupu** |
| Dative | lupo | ad **lupu** |
| Ablative | lupo | (various prepositions) + **lupu** |
| Vocative | lupe | **lupu** |

The loss of final -m led to the merger of nominative and accusative in many nouns:

- Classical **rosa** (nom.) / **rosam** (acc.) > Vulgar **rosa** (both nom. and acc.)
- **murus** (nom.) / **murum** (acc.) > **muru** (both nom. and acc.)

Gender system remained largely intact, with masculine, feminine, and neuter. However, neuter nouns tended to be reanalyzed as masculine or feminine:

- **vinum** (wine, neut.) > **vinu** (masc.)
- **folium** (leaf, neut.) > **folia** (fem.)
- **mare** (sea, neut.) > **mare** (fem. in some dialects)

New declension patterns emerged:

1. Third declension nouns with -is nominative often added -e in Vulgar Latin:
   - **panis** > **pane** (bread)
   - **mensis** > **mese** (month)

2. Some consonant-stem nouns added -e to the stem:
   - **nox, noctis** > **nocte** (night)
   - **dens, dentis** > **dente** (tooth)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns underwent changes, particularly in the first and second person plural forms:

| Person | Classical Latin | Vulgar Latin | Example |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| 1st sg. | ego | **eo** | **Eo canto** (I sing) |
| 2nd sg. | tu | **tu** | **Tu cantas** (You sing) |
| 3rd sg. m. | is | **illu** | **Illu cantat** (He sings) |
| 3rd sg. f. | ea | **illa** | **Illa cantat** (She sings) |
| 1st pl. | nos | **nos** / **noi** | **Nos cantamus** (We sing) |
| 2nd pl. | vos | **vos** / **voi** | **Vos cantatis** (You sing) |
| 3rd pl. m. | ei | **illi** | **Illi cantant** (They sing) |
| 3rd pl. f. | eae | **illas** | **Illas cantant** (They sing) |

Demonstrative pronouns were simplified:

- **hic**, **iste**, **ille** > **eccu** + **ille** (this), **ille** (that)

Examples: 
- Classical **hic homo** > Vulgar **eccu illu omu** (this man)
- **illa femina** > **eccu illa femina** (this woman)

Relative pronouns were also simplified:

- **qui**, **quae**, **quod** > invariable **que**
  Example: **homu que venit** (the man who comes)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Vulgar Latin generally followed the same pattern as nouns, with the loss of neuter forms and case simplification:

| Gender | Classical Latin | Vulgar Latin |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| Masc. | bonus, bonum | **bonu** |
| Fem. | bona | **bona** |
| Neut. | bonum | (lost) |

Comparative and superlative forms became increasingly analytic:

- Classical comparative **altior** (higher) > Vulgar **plus altu**
- Classical superlative **altissimus** (highest) > Vulgar **lu plus altu**

However, some common adjectives retained synthetic forms:
- **bonus**, **melior**, **optimu**
- **malus**, **peior**, **pessimu**

### Verbs

Vulgar Latin verbal system underwent significant changes:

1. Loss of deponent verbs:
   - Classical **loquor** (I speak) > Vulgar **parlo**
   - **sequor** (I follow) > **sequo**

2. Replacement of synthetic passive with analytic forms:
   - Classical **amor** (I am loved) > Vulgar **so amatu** (I am loved)
   - **laudatur** (he is praised) > **est laudatu**

3. Development of compound tenses:
   - Future: **cantare habeo** (I have to sing) > I will sing
     Example: **amare habeo** > French **aimerai** (I will love)
   - Perfect: **habeo cantatum** (I have sung)
     Example: **habeo factum** > Italian **ho fatto** (I have done)

4. Loss of perfect/aorist distinction:
   - **cantavi** (I sang / I have sung) used for both meanings
   - Example: **feci** meaning both "I did" and "I have done"

5. Emergence of conditional mood:
   - **cantare habebam** (I had to sing) > I would sing
   - Example: **amare habebam** > Spanish **amaría** (I would love)

6. Loss of the future participle and supine

7. Spread of inchoative infix -sc- to more verbs:
   - **florire** > **florescere** (to bloom)

Example conjugation of **cantare** (to sing) in present tense:

| Person | Classical Latin | Vulgar Latin |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1st sg. | canto | **canto** |
| 2nd sg. | cantas | **cantas** |
| 3rd sg. | cantat | **cantat** |
| 1st pl. | cantamus | **cantamus** |
| 2nd pl. | cantatis | **cantatis** |
| 3rd pl. | cantant | **cantant** |

Past tense (perfect) of **cantare**:

| Person | Classical Latin | Vulgar Latin |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1st sg. | cantavi | **cantai** |
| 2nd sg. | cantavisti | **cantasti** |
| 3rd sg. | cantavit | **cantaut** |
| 1st pl. | cantavimus | **cantammus** |
| 2nd pl. | cantavistis | **cantastis** |
| 3rd pl. | cantaverunt | **cantarunt** |

## Syntax

Vulgar Latin syntax moved towards more analytic structures, relying less on inflection and more on word order and prepositions.

### Word Order

While Classical Latin had a relatively free word order due to its case system, Vulgar Latin tended towards a more fixed Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order:

- Classical: **Lupus agnum vidit** / **Agnum lupus vidit** / **Vidit lupus agnum** (The wolf saw the lamb)
- Vulgar: **Lu lupu vidit lu agnu** (The wolf saw the lamb)

Other word order changes:

1. Adjectives tended to follow nouns:
   - Classical: **magna domus** (big house)
   - Vulgar: **casa grande** (big house)

2. Possessives often followed nouns:
   - Classical: **meus pater** (my father)
   - Vulgar: **patre meu** (my father)

3. Object pronouns began to precede verbs:
   - Classical: **video te** (I see you)
   - Vulgar: **te video** (I see you)

### Prepositions

With the simplification of the case system, prepositions took on a more important role in expressing grammatical relationships:

- Classical genitive: **domus patris** (father's house)
- Vulgar Latin: **casa de patre** (house of father)

Other examples:
- **ad** replacing dative: **do ad te** (I give to you)
- **de** for partitive: **unu de illi** (one of them)
- **in** with accusative for motion: **vado in Roma** (I go to Rome)

### Subordinate Clauses

Vulgar Latin saw a shift from using subjunctive mood in subordinate clauses to indicative:

- Classical: **Timeo ne veniat** (I fear that he may come)
- Vulgar: **Timeo que venit** (I fear that he comes)

The infinitive was often replaced by **que** + finite verb:
- Classical: **Volo venire** (I want to come)
- Vulgar: **Volo que venio** (I want that I come)

### Comparison of Adjectives

The synthetic comparative and superlative forms were largely replaced by analytic constructions:

- Classical: **altior** (higher), **altissimus** (highest)
- Vulgar: **plus altu** (more high), **lu plus altu** (the most high)

### Negation

Double negation became common in Vulgar Latin:

- Classical: **Neminem video** (I see no one)
- Vulgar: **Non video nemo** (I don't see no one)

### Question Formation

Question particles like **que** (what) and **quomodo** (how) became more common in forming questions:

- Classical: **Quid facis?** (What are you doing?)
- Vulgar: **Que facis?** (What are you doing?)

- Classical: **Quomodo vales?** (How are you?)
- Vulgar: **Quomodo stas?** (How are you?)

Yes/no questions were often formed with the particle **si** (if):

- Classical: **Venisne?** (Are you coming?)
- Vulgar: **Si venis?** (Are you coming?)

## Vocabulary

Vulgar Latin vocabulary differed significantly from Classical Latin, with many classical words replaced by colloquial terms or new formations.

### Lexical Replacements

Many common Classical Latin words were replaced in Vulgar Latin:

| Classical Latin | Vulgar Latin | Meaning | Example |
|-----------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| equus | **caballu** | horse | Spanish "caballo", French "cheval" |
| ignis | **focu** | fire | Italian "fuoco", Romanian "foc" |

### Word Formation

New words were formed through various processes:

1. Compounding:
   - **male** + **habitus** > **malabitu** (sick)
   - **bene** + **venire** > **benvenire** (to welcome)

2. Affixation:
   - Diminutives: **-ellu**, **-ittu**
     Example: **porcus** (pig) > **porcellu** (little pig)

     Example: **nasus** (nose) > **nasone** (big nose)

3. Semantic shifts:
   - **testa** (pot) > "head"
   - **focus** (hearth) > "fire"
   - **plumbu** (lead) > "grey" in some dialects

4. Borrowings:
   - From Greek: **colpus** (gulf) from κόλπος

## Regional Variations

Vulgar Latin was not a uniform language but varied across different regions of the Roman Empire. These variations laid the groundwork for the development of distinct Romance languages.

### Western Romance

Characteristics of Western Romance (precursor to Spanish, Portuguese, French, etc.):

1. Lenition of intervocalic consonants:
   - **vita** [ˈvita] > [ˈviða] (life)

3. Unique developments:
   - Latin F > [h] or Ø: **filia** > **fiza** [ˈfiða] (daughter)
   - Retention of -s plurals: **canes** > **canes** (dogs)

## Phonological Developments

### Vowel Changes

1. Metaphony: vowel harmony affecting stressed vowels
   - **vinti** (twenty) > **venti** in some dialects
   - **illi** (those) > **elli** in some areas

2. Diphthongization of stressed vowels:
   - **petra** [ˈpetra] > [ˈpjɛtra] (stone)
   - **focus** [ˈfokus] > [ˈfwoku] (fire)

3. Syncope: loss of unstressed vowels
   - **calidus** > **caldu** (hot)
   - **viridis** > **virde** (green)

4. Apocope: loss of final vowels (in Western Romance)
   - **amare** > **amar** (to love)
   - **muru** > **mur** (wall)

### Consonant Changes

1. Lenition: weakening of consonants between vowels
   - **ripa** > **riba** (riverbank)
   - **securu** > **seguru** (safe)

2. Yod effects: palatalization due to [j]
   - **puteu** [ˈputeu] > [ˈputtsu] (well)

6. Metathesis: reordering of sounds:
   - **crocodilus** > **cocodrilus** (crocodile)
   - **parabola** > **palabra** (word) in Spanish

## Examples of Vulgar Latin Texts

While no extensive texts in pure Vulgar Latin exist, some inscriptions and glosses provide glimpses into its features:

1. Graffiti from Pompeii (1st century CE):
   **"Quisquis ama valia peria qui nosci amare"**
   (Whoever loves, may they be well; may they perish who know not how to love)

   Classical Latin: "Quisquis amat valeat, pereat qui nescit amare"

2. From the Appendix Probi (3rd-4th century CE), a list of "correct" and "incorrect" forms:
   **"speculum non speclum"** (mirror, not 'speclum')
   **"calida non calda"** (hot, not 'calda')
   **"auris non oricla"** (ear, not 'oricla')
   **"oculus non oclus"** (eye, not 'oclus')

3. From the Reichenau Glosses (8th century CE):
   **"matus: tristis"** ('matus' means sad)
   This shows the use of **matus** (from **mattus**, 'drunk') for 'sad', a semantic shift from Classical Latin.

4. The Oaths of Strasbourg (842 CE), while technically Old French, show many Vulgar Latin features:
   **"Pro Deo amur et pro christian poblo et nostro commun salvament..."**
   (For the love of God and for the Christian people and our common salvation...)

These examples demonstrate various features of Vulgar Latin, including:
- Simplification of consonant clusters (**speclum** for **speculum**)
- Loss of neuter gender (**vinu** for **vinum**)
- Syncope (**calda** for **calida**)
- Semantic shifts (**matus** for 'sad')
- Development of definite articles (**lo**, **la**)
- Use of prepositions to replace case endings (**de**, **pro**)
