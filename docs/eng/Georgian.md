# Georgian

Georgian (ქართული ენა, **kartuli ena**) is the official language of Georgia, spoken by about 4 million people primarily in Georgia and by emigrant communities in various countries. It belongs to the Kartvelian language family, which is unrelated to any other language family. Georgian has a unique alphabet and a long literary tradition dating back to the 5th century.

## Alphabet and Pronunciation

The Georgian alphabet, known as Mkhedruli (მხედრული), consists of 33 letters. Each letter represents a single sound, making the orthography highly phonemic.

### Pronunciation Notes

1. Aspiration: Georgian distinguishes between aspirated and ejective consonants. For example, თ /tʰ/ is aspirated, while ტ /tʼ/ is ejective.

2. Vowels: Georgian has five vowels (ა, ე, ი, ო, უ), which are generally pronounced as in Italian or Spanish.

3. Consonant Clusters: Georgian is known for its complex consonant clusters, which can occur at the beginning, middle, or end of words. For example:
   - **გვპრთხილობს** /gvprtʰxilɔbs/ (“he/she is warning us”)
   - **მწვრთნელი** /mtsʼvrtʰnɛli/ (“coach”)

4. Stress: Stress in Georgian is generally weak and falls on the first syllable of a word, but it can shift in certain grammatical forms or compound words.

## Morphology

Georgian is an agglutinative language with a rich morphological system. Verbs are particularly complex, while nouns have a relatively simpler structure.

### Nouns

Nouns in Georgian do not have grammatical gender. They decline for number (singular and plural) and case.

#### Number

The plural is typically formed by adding the suffix -ები (-ebi) to the singular form:

- **წიგნი** (tsigni) “book” → **წიგნები** (tsignebi) “books”
- **კაცი** (katsi) “man” → **კაცები** (katsebi) “men”

Some nouns have irregular plurals:
- **ძმა** (dzma) “brother” → **ძმები** (dzmebi) “brothers”
- **და** (da) “sister” → **დები** (debi) “sisters”

#### Cases

Georgian has seven cases:

1. Nominative (subject)
2. Ergative (subject of transitive verbs in certain tenses)
3. Dative (indirect object, possession)
4. Genitive (possession)
5. Instrumental (means, accompaniment)
6. Adverbial (purpose, function)
7. Vocative (direct address)

Example declension of **კაცი** (katsi) “man”:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | კაცი (katsi) | კაცები (katsebi) |
| Ergative | კაცმა (katsma) | კაცებმა (katsebma) |
| Dative | კაცს (katss) | კაცებს (katsebs) |
| Genitive | კაცის (katsis) | კაცების (katsebis) |
| Instrumental | კაცით (katsit) | კაცებით (katsebit) |
| Adverbial | კაცად (katsad) | კაცებად (katsebad) |
| Vocative | კაცო (katso) | კაცებო (katsebo) |

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Georgian usually precede the noun they modify and agree with it in case and number. Most adjectives end in -ი (-i) in their basic form.

Example with **დიდი** (didi) “big”:

- Nominative: **დიდი სახლი** (didi sakhli) “big house”
- Ergative: **დიდმა სახლმა** (didma sakhlma) “by the big house”
- Dative: **დიდ სახლს** (did sakhls) “to the big house”

Comparatives are formed with the prefix უ- (u-) and suffix -ეს (-es):
- **დიდი** (didi) “big” → **უდიდესი** (udidesi) “biggest”

Superlatives add the prefix ყველაზე (qvelaze) “most” to the comparative:
- **ყველაზე უდიდესი** (qvelaze udidesi) “the biggest”

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Georgian decline for case but not for gender. Here are the nominative and ergative forms:

| Person | Nominative | Ergative |
|--------|------------|----------|
| 1sg | მე (me) | მე (me) |
| 2sg | შენ (shen) | შენ (shen) |
| 3sg | ის (is) | მან (man) |
| 1pl | ჩვენ (chven) | ჩვენ (chven) |
| 2pl | თქვენ (tkven) | თქვენ (tkven) |
| 3pl | ისინი (isini) | მათ (mat) |

Demonstrative pronouns:
- **ეს** (es) “this” (near)
- **ეგ** (eg) “that” (medium distance)
- **ის** (is) “that” (far)

Possessive pronouns are formed by adding the genitive case ending to personal pronouns:
- **ჩემი** (chemi) “my”
- **შენი** (sheni) “your”
- **მისი** (misi) “his/her/its”

### Verbs

Georgian verbs are notoriously complex, with many features that are challenging for learners:

1. Person and Number: Verbs agree with both the subject and object in person and number.

2. Screeves: Georgian verbs have three sets of tenses called screeves (მწკრივი, mtsskrivi):
   - Present/Future screeve
   - Aorist screeve
   - Perfect screeve

3. Series: Within each screeve, verbs are conjugated in different series:
   - Present series
   - Future series
   - Aorist series
   - Perfect series
   - Pluperfect series
   - Subjunctive series

4. Version: Verbs can indicate the direction of action (towards or away from the speaker) or benefaction.

5. Preverbs: Prefixes that can change the meaning or aspect of a verb.

#### Basic Verb Structure

A Georgian verb can have the following structure:

(Preverb) - (Version vowel) - Root - (Thematic suffix) - (Screeve marker) - Person marker

Example with the verb **აკეთებს** (aketebs) “he/she does”:

- Preverb: **გა-** (ga-)
- Version vowel: **ა-** (a-)
- Root: **-კეთ-** (-ket-)
- Thematic suffix: **-ებ-** (-eb-)
- Person marker: **-ს** (-s)

#### Conjugation Example

Let's conjugate the verb **აკეთებს** (aketebs) “to do” in the present tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | ვაკეთებ (vaketeb) | ვაკეთებთ (vaketebт) |
| 2 | აკეთებ (aketeb) | აკეთებთ (aketebт) |
| 3 | აკეთებს (aketebs) | აკეთებენ (aketeben) |

#### Aspect

Georgian verbs have perfective and imperfective aspects, often distinguished by preverbs:

- Imperfective: **აკეთებს** (aketebs) “he/she is doing”
- Perfective: **გააკეთებს** (gaaketebs) “he/she will do”

#### Passive Voice

Passive voice is formed by adding the prefix **ი-** (i-) or **ე-** (e-) to the verb stem:

- Active: **აშენებს** (ashenebs) “he/she builds”
- Passive: **შენდება** (shendeba) “it is being built”

## Syntax

Georgian is a SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) language, but word order can be flexible due to the case system.

### Basic Sentence Structure

A typical Georgian sentence follows this pattern:

(Subject) (Indirect Object) (Direct Object) Verb

Example:
**გიორგი მარიამს წიგნს აძლევს.**
(Giorgi Mariams tsigns adzlevs.)
“George gives Mary a book.”

### Agreement

Verbs agree with both the subject and direct object in person and number:

**მე შენ გხედავ.**
(Me shen gkhedav.)
“I see you.”

Here, the verb **გხედავ** (gkhedav) contains markers for both the first-person subject (“I”) and the second-person object (“you”).

### Postpositions

Georgian uses postpositions rather than prepositions:

**სახლის წინ**
(sakhlis tsin)
“in front of the house”

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are formed using the relative pronoun **რომელიც** (romelits) “which”:

**კაცი, რომელიც აქ ცხოვრობს, ჩემი მეზობელია.**
(Katsi, romelits ak tskhovrobs, chemi mezobelia.)
“The man who lives here is my neighbor.”

### Questions

Questions can be formed by adding the particle **-ა** (-a) to the verb or using question words:

- **მოდიხარ?** (modikhar?) “Are you coming?”
- **სად მიდიხარ?** (sad midikhar?) “Where are you going?”

## Vocabulary

Georgian vocabulary is primarily derived from Common Kartvelian roots, but has been influenced by various languages throughout its history:

1. Persian: 
   - **ფანჯარა** (panjara) “window”
   - **ქალაქი** (kalaki) “city”

2. Arabic:
   - **ალამი** (alami) “flag”
   - **ქარავანი** (karavani) “caravan”

3. Greek:
   - **ანგელოზი** (angelozi) “angel”
   - **ეკლესია** (eklesia) “church”

4. Turkish:
   - **ფაშა** (pasha) “pasha”
   - **ყავა** (qava) “coffee”

5. Russian (mostly modern terms):
   - **მანქანა** (mankan) “car”
   - **ტელევიზორი** (televizori) “television”

### Word Formation

Georgian uses several methods for word formation:

1. Compounding:
   - **მზე** (mze) “sun” + **სინათლე** (sinatle) “light” → **მზესინათლე** (mzesinatle) “sunlight”

2. Affixation:
   - **წერა** (tsera) “to write” → **მწერალი** (mtserali) “writer”

3. Conversion:
   - **თეთრი** (tetri) “white” → **თეთრი** (tetri) “coin” (historically a silver coin)

## Dialects

Georgian has several dialects, mostly corresponding to historical provinces:

1. Kartlian (central Georgia)
2. Kakheti (eastern Georgia)
3. Imereti (western Georgia)
4. Gurian (southwestern Georgia)
5. Adjaran (southwestern Georgia, near Turkey)
6. Rachian (northwestern Georgia)
7. Lechkhumian (northwestern Georgia)
8. Svan (northwestern Georgia, sometimes considered a separate language)
9. Mingrelian (western Georgia, sometimes considered a separate language)

Standard Georgian is based on the Kartlian dialect, but incorporates features from other dialects.

## Colloquial Georgian

Colloquial Georgian can differ significantly from the standard written language:

1. Contractions:
   - Standard: **არ არის** (ar aris) “is not”
   - Colloquial: **არაა** (araa)

2. Vowel reduction:
   - Standard: **გამარჯობა** (gamarjoba) “hello”
   - Colloquial: **გამარჯობ** (gamarjob)

3. Particle usage:
   - The particle **-ო** (-o) is often added to reported speech in colloquial Georgian:
     **მოვდივარო** (modivaro) “He says he's coming”

4. Loanwords:
   Colloquial Georgian, especially among younger speakers, incorporates many English loanwords:
   - **ოკეი** (okei) “okay”
   - **ბაი** (bai) “bye”

## Idiomatic Expressions

Georgian has many colorful idiomatic expressions:

1. **შენი ჭირიმე** (sheni chirime) - literally “may I take your trouble,” used as a term of endearment or gratitude

2. **გულის გახეთქვა** (gulis gakhetkva) - literally “to tear one's heart,” meaning to worry excessively

3. **თავის მოკატუნება** (tavis mokatuneba) - literally “to make oneself into a kitten,” meaning to pretend to be innocent

4. **ენის მოტეხვა** (enis motexva) - literally “to break one's tongue,” meaning to struggle with pronunciation

5. **ყურების ჩამოყრა** (qurebis chamoqra) - literally “to drop one's ears,” meaning to become sad or disappointed

## Phonological Processes

Georgian exhibits several interesting phonological processes:

1. Vowel Syncopation: In certain grammatical forms, unstressed vowels may be dropped:
   - **ქალაქი** (kalaki) “city” → **ქალქის** (kalkis) “of the city”

2. Consonant Assimilation: Consonants often assimilate in voicing or place of articulation:
   - **გადმო-** (gadmo-) + **კვეთა** (kveta) → **გადმოგვეთა** (gadmogveta) “to cross over”

3. Epenthesis: In some consonant clusters, a vowel may be inserted:
   - **ფიქრი** (pikri) → colloquial **ფიქირი** (pikiri) “thought”

## Verb Classes

Georgian verbs can be categorized into several classes based on their morphological behavior:

1. Transitive verbs: Take direct objects and use the ergative case for subjects in certain tenses.
   Example: **წერს** (tsers) “he/she writes”

2. Intransitive verbs: Do not take direct objects.
   Example: **დგას** (dgas) “he/she stands”

3. Indirect verbs: Take indirect objects in the dative case.
   Example: **უყვარს** (uqvars) “he/she loves”

4. Medial verbs: Express actions done for oneself.
   Example: **იბანს** (ibans) “he/she washes oneself”

5. Stative verbs: Express states rather than actions.
   Example: **აქვს** (akvs) “he/she has”

## Verb Screeves

The Georgian verb system is organized into screeves, which are groups of related tenses and moods. Here's a more detailed look at the main screeves:

1. Present/Future Screeve:
   - Present: **აკეთებს** (aketebs) “he/she does”
   - Future: **გააკეთებს** (gaaketebs) “he/she will do”
   - Present Subjunctive: **აკეთებდეს** (aketebdes) “he/she may do”

2. Imperfect/Conditional Screeve:
   - Imperfect: **აკეთებდა** (aketebda) “he/she was doing”
   - Conditional: **გააკეთებდა** (gaaketebda) “he/she would do”

3. Aorist/Optative Screeve:
   - Aorist: **გააკეთა** (gaaketa) “he/she did”
   - Optative: **გააკეთოს** (gaaket'os) “let him/her do”

4. Perfect Screeve:
   - Perfect: **გაუკეთებია** (gauket'ebia) “he/she has apparently done”
   - Pluperfect: **გაეკეთებინა** (gaeket'ebina) “he/she had done”

## Numerals

Georgian has a vigesimal (base-20) number system, which is evident in numbers from 20 to 99:

- 1-10: **ერთი** (erti), **ორი** (ori), **სამი** (sami), **ოთხი** (otkhi), **ხუთი** (khuti), **ექვსი** (ekvsi), **შვიდი** (shvidi), **რვა** (rva), **ცხრა** (tsxra), **ათი** (ati)
- 20: **ოცი** (otsi)
- 21: **ოცდაერთი** (otsdaerti) (literally “twenty and one”)
- 40: **ორმოცი** (ormotsi) (literally “two twenty”)
- 50: **ორმოცდაათი** (ormotsdaati) (literally “two twenty and ten”)

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding the circumfix **მე- -ე** (me- -e) to the cardinal number:
- **მეორე** (meore) “second”
- **მესამე** (mesame) “third”

## Reduplication

Georgian uses reduplication for emphasis or to create new words:

- **ნელ-ნელა** (nel-nela) “very slowly” (from **ნელი** (neli) “slow”)
- **ცოტ-ცოტა** (tsot-tsota) “little by little” (from **ცოტა** (tsota) “little”)

## Politeness and Formality

Georgian has several ways to express politeness and formality:

1. Second person plural forms used for formal address:
   - Informal: **შენ ხარ** (shen khar) “you are”
   - Formal: **თქვენ ბრძანდებით** (tkven brdzandebit) “you are” (polite)

2. Honorific verbs:
   - **ბრძანება** (brdzaneba) “to order, to say” (polite)
   - **მობრძანება** (mobrdzaneba) “to come” (polite)

3. Polite particles:
   - **-ო** (-o) added to the end of a sentence when addressing someone formally

## Loan Translation (Calques)

Georgian has many calques, particularly from Russian:

- **წყალსაცავი** (tsqalsatsavi) “water reservoir” (from Russian водохранилище)
- **თვითმფრინავი** (tvitmfrinavi) “airplane” (literally “self-flyer”, from Russian самолёт)

## Nominal Derivation

Georgian uses various affixes to derive nouns:

1. Agent nouns:
   - **-ელი** (-eli): **მასწავლებელი** (mastsavlebeli) “teacher” (from **სწავლა** (stsavla) “to learn”)

2. Abstract nouns:
   - **-ობა** (-oba): **მეგობრობა** (megobroba) “friendship” (from **მეგობარი** (megobari) “friend”)

3. Diminutives:
   - **-იკო** (-iko): **კაციკო** (katsiko) “little man” (from **კაცი** (katsi) “man”)

## Verbal Nouns (Masdar)

Georgian can form verbal nouns (similar to gerunds in English) from verbs:

- **კეთება** (keteba) “doing” (from **აკეთებს** (aketebs) “to do”)
- **სიარული** (siaruli) “walking” (from **დადის** (dadis) “to walk”)

These verbal nouns can be used as subjects or objects in sentences:

**სიარული სასიამოვნოა.**
(Siaruli sasiamovnoa.)
“Walking is pleasant.”

## Evidentiality

Georgian has grammatical markers for evidentiality, indicating the source of information:

- Direct evidence: **წვიმს** (tsvims) “It's raining” (the speaker sees it raining)
- Indirect evidence: **წვიმდა** (tsvimda) “It was raining” (the speaker infers it rained, e.g., from wet ground)
- Reported speech: **წვიმსო** (tsvimso) “It's raining, they say” (the speaker heard it from someone else)

This comprehensive overview covers many aspects of the Georgian language, from its unique alphabet and complex verb system to its idiomatic expressions and cultural nuances. The language's rich morphology, flexible syntax, and distinct features like its vigesimal number system make it a fascinating subject for linguistic study.
