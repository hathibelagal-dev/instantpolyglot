# Breton

Breton (Brezhoneg) is a Celtic language spoken in Brittany, northwestern France. It is part of the Brythonic branch of Celtic languages, closely related to Cornish and Welsh. As of 2023, there are approximately 200,000 speakers of Breton, with most being bilingual in French. The language has been in decline since the early 20th century due to French language policies, but revitalization efforts have been ongoing since the late 20th century.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Breton has the following consonant phonemes:

| Manner | Labial | Dental/Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--------|--------|-----------------|---------|-------|---------|
| Plosive | p b | t d | | k g | |
| Nasal | m | n | ɲ | | |
| Fricative | f v | s z | ʃ ʒ | x | h |
| Approximant | w | l | j | | |
| Trill | | r | | | |

Note: The sound [x] is often realized as [h] in modern Breton.

Some consonant clusters in Breton can be challenging for non-native speakers:

- **skr-**: **skrivañ** [ˈskriːvə̃] (to write)
- **str-**: **strad** [strat] (bottom)
- **c'hw-**: **c'hwec'h** [xwɛx] (six)

### Vowels

Breton has the following vowel phonemes:

| | Front | Central | Back |
|-------|-------|---------|------|
| Close | i y | | u |
| Mid | e ø | ə | o |
| Open | ɛ | | ɔ |
| Open | | a | |

Breton also has nasal vowels: [ã], [ɛ̃], [õ].

Vowel length is phonemic in Breton, although it's not always marked in writing:

- **kar** [kaːr] (relative) vs. **karr** [kar] (cart)
- **tomm** [tɔ̃m] (hot) vs. **tom** [tɔ̃ːm] (heap)

### Diphthongs

Breton has several diphthongs:

- **ae**: **mae** [maɛ] (May)
- **ao**: **aod** [awt] (coast)
- **ei**: **seiz** [sɛjz] (seven)
- **eu**: **feunteun** [fœ̃ntœ̃n] (fountain)
- **ou**: **dour** [duːr] (water)

### Stress

Stress in Breton is usually on the penultimate syllable:

- **kazetenn** [kaˈzɛtən] (newspaper)
- **labour** [ˈlabuːr] (work)

However, there are exceptions, particularly with words ending in certain suffixes:

- **brezhoneg** [brəˈzõːnək] (Breton language)
- **gwirionez** [gwiˈrjõːne] (truth)

In compound words, each element typically retains its original stress:

- **ti-kêr** [ˈtiˈkɛːr] (town hall, literally "house-town")

### Mutations

Breton, like other Celtic languages, features initial consonant mutations. There are four types of mutations in Breton:

1. Soft mutation (lenition)
2. Spirant mutation
3. Hard mutation (provection)
4. Mixed mutation

Examples:

1. Soft mutation:
   - **penn** (head) → **e benn** (his head)
   - **tad** (father) → **da dad** (your father)
   - **gwele** (bed) → **ur wele** (a bed)

2. Spirant mutation:
   - **tad** (father) → **ho tad** (your father)
   - **penn** (head) → **o fenn** (their head)

3. Hard mutation:
   - **gwele** (bed) → **ar c'hwele** (the bed)
   - **bras** (big) → **ar pras** (the big one)

4. Mixed mutation:
   - **kwele** (bed) → **o hwele** (their bed)
   - **gwin** (wine) → **o hwin** (their wine)

These mutations occur in various grammatical contexts, such as after certain prepositions, possessive adjectives, or the definite article.

## Orthography

Breton uses the Latin alphabet with some additional letters and diacritics. The standard orthography, known as peurunvan (unified), was established in 1941. However, other orthographic systems exist, including skolveurieg and etrerannyezhel.

### Alphabet

The Breton alphabet consists of the following letters:

a b ch c'h d e f g h i j k l m n o p r s t u v w y z

Additional letters:

- ñ: used in some dialects
- ù: used in some dialects to represent [y]

Digraphs:

- ch: [ʃ] as in **chas** [ʃas] (dogs)
- c'h: [x] or [h] as in **c'hoari** [ˈxwaːri] (to play)

### Diacritics

- Acute accent (´): used on é to represent [e]
  Example: **kaféenn** [kaˈfeːən] (coffee)

- Grave accent (`): used on è to represent [ɛ]
  Example: **kèr** [kɛːr] (city)

- Circumflex (ˆ): used to indicate long vowels, e.g., â, ê, î, ô, û
  Example: **môr** [moːr] (sea)

### Sound-Symbol Correspondences

Some notable sound-symbol correspondences:

- c: always [k] as in **car** [kaːr] (car)
- g: always [g], never soft, as in **glas** [glas] (blue)
- s: always [s], never [z], as in **stered** [ˈstɛrət] (stars)
- z: [z] as in **kazh** [kaz] (cat)
- zh: [z] (in some orthographies) as in **brezhoneg** [brəˈzõːnək] (Breton language)
- ou: [u] as in **dour** [duːr] (water)
- añ, eñ, oñ: nasal vowels [ã], [ɛ̃], [õ] as in **añ** [ã] (that), **leñv** [lɛ̃v] (cry), **skoñs** [skõs] (sconce)

### Spelling Rules

1. Word-final voiceless consonants are often written as their voiced counterparts:
   - **tad** [tat] (father)
   - **bag** [bak] (boat)

2. The letter 'n' before 'k' or 'g' is often pronounced [ŋ]:
   - **bank** [bãŋk] (bank)
   - **angel** [ˈãŋgəl] (angel)

3. The combination 'zh' is used in some orthographies to represent [z], especially in word-final position:
   - **kazh** [kaz] (cat)

4. The apostrophe is used to indicate elision:
   - **d'an** (to the) from **da** + **an**
   - **n'eo ket** (it is not) from **ne** + **eo** + **ket**

## Morphology

### Nouns

Breton nouns have two genders: masculine and feminine. They can be singular or plural, and there is no case system.

#### Gender

Gender in Breton is not always predictable, but there are some patterns:

- Masculine: most animals, professions, trees, mountains, winds
- Feminine: most abstract nouns, rivers, boats

Examples:
- **ki** (dog, masc.)
- **kazh** (cat, masc.)
- **gwez** (tree, masc.)
- **menez** (mountain, masc.)
- **avel** (wind, masc.)
- **lestr** (boat, fem.)
- **stêr** (river, fem.)
- **karantez** (love, fem.)

Some nouns change gender when they change from singular to plural:
- **ar c'harr** (the car, masc.) → **ar c'hirri** (the cars, fem.)

#### Plural Formation

Plural formation in Breton is complex, with several patterns:

1. Adding a suffix:
   - **-où**: **ti** (house) → **tiez** (houses)
   - **-ed**: **evn** (bird) → **evned** (birds)
   - **-ien**: **mestr** (master) → **mistri** (masters)
   - **-i**: **ki** (dog) → **chas** (dogs)

2. Changing the final consonant:
   - **bran** (crow) → **brini** (crows)
   - **maen** (stone) → **mein** (stones)

3. Internal vowel change:
   - **dant** (tooth) → **dent** (teeth)
   - **kar** (relative) → **kerent** (relatives)

4. Irregular plurals:
   - **den** (person) → **tud** (people)
   - **bugel** (child) → **bugale** (children)
   - **loen** (animal) → **loened** (animals)

Some nouns have multiple plural forms with different meanings:
- **breur** (brother) → **breudeur** (brothers) or **breuriez** (brotherhood)

#### Diminutives

Breton uses diminutive suffixes to create affectionate or smaller versions of nouns:

- **-ig**: **ti** (house) → **tiig** (little house)
- **-ik**: **paotr** (boy) → **paotrik** (little boy)

### Articles

Breton has definite articles but no indefinite articles.

Definite article: **an** (the)

Before vowels and most consonants:
- **an ti** (the house)
- **an dud** (the people)

Before "n", "d", "t", "h":
- **an neizh** (the nest)
- **an dour** (the water)
- **an ti** (the house)
- **an hent** (the road)

The article causes mutations in following words:
- **penn** (head) → **ar penn** (the head)
- **kador** (chair) → **ar gador** (the chair)
- **gwele** (bed) → **ar gwele** (the bed)

For indefinite nouns, the article is simply omitted:
- **Ti zo e kêr** (There is a house in town)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Breton usually follow the noun they modify and agree in gender and number.

Examples:
- **ti bras** (big house)
- **tier bras** (big houses)
- **plac'h vihan** (small girl)
- **merc'hed bihan** (small girls)

Some adjectives precede the noun:
- **kozh den** (old man)
- **gwir vignoned** (true friends)
- **fall amzer** (bad weather)

Adjectives also undergo mutations:
- **bras** (big) → **ur vazh vras** (a big stick)
- **kaer** (beautiful) → **ur gêr gaer** (a beautiful city)

Comparative and superlative forms:

- Comparative: **-oc'h**
  **bras** (big) → **brasoc'h** (bigger)

- Superlative: **ar ... -añ**
  **bras** (big) → **ar brasañ** (the biggest)

Irregular forms exist:
- **mat** (good) → **gwell** (better) → **ar gwellañ** (the best)
- **fall** (bad) → **gwazh** (worse) → **ar gwashañ** (the worst)

### Pronouns

#### Personal Pronouns

|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **me** | **ni** |

Impersonal: **an** (one, people)

In addition to these basic forms, Breton has a complex system of inflected prepositions that combine pronouns with prepositions:

### Verbs

Breton verbs are conjugated for person, number, tense, and mood. The infinitive typically ends in **-añ**, **-iñ**, or **-out**.

#### Present Tense

Example with **kanañ** (to sing):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **kanan** | **kanomp** |
| 2nd | **kanez** | **kanit** |
| 3rd | **kan** | **kanont** |

In everyday speech, Breton often uses a periphrastic construction with the verbal noun and the auxiliary verb **ober** (to do):

- **Kanañ a ran** (I sing, lit. "Singing I do")
- **Kanañ a rez** (You sing)
- **Kanañ a ra** (He/She sings)

#### Past Tense

Breton uses a compound past tense formed with the auxiliary **bezañ** (to be) and the past participle:

- **Kaned em eus** (I have sung)
- **Kaned ec'h eus** (You have sung)
- **Kaned en deus** (He has sung)
- **Kaned he deus** (She has sung)
- **Kaned hon eus** (We have sung)
- **Kaned hoc'h eus** (You have sung)
- **Kaned o deus** (They have sung)

There's also a simple past tense, though it's less common in modern spoken Breton:

- **Kanis** (I sang)
- **Kanjomp** (We sang)

#### Imperfect Tense

The imperfect tense is used for habitual or continuous actions in the past:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **kanen** | **kanemp** |
| 2nd | **kanez** | **kanec'h** |
| 3rd | **kane** | **kanent** |

Example: **Kane ar vugale bemdez** (The children sang every day)

#### Future Tense

The future tense is formed by adding specific endings to the verb stem:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **kanin** | **kanimp** |
| 2nd | **kani** | **kanot** |
| 3rd | **kano** | **kanint** |

Example: **Kanin ur ganaouenn warc'hoazh** (I will sing a song tomorrow)

#### Conditional Mood

The conditional mood is used to express hypothetical situations:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **kanfen** | **kanfemp** |
| 2nd | **kanfes** | **kanfec'h** |
| 3rd | **kanfe** | **kanfent** |

Example: **Kanfen ma ouifen ar c'homzoù** (I would sing if I knew the words)

#### Imperative

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 2nd | **kan** | **kanit** |

Example: **Kan ur son evidon!** (Sing a song for me!)

#### Participles

- Present participle: **o kanañ** (singing)
- Past participle: **kanet** (sung)

#### Verbal Noun

The verbal noun is a crucial feature of Breton verbs. It's used in many constructions and often corresponds to the English gerund or infinitive:

- **Karout a ran kanañ** (I like singing/to sing)
- **Deuet on da ganañ** (I've come to sing)

#### Irregular Verbs

Some common irregular verbs include:

1. **bezañ** (to be):
   - Present: **on**, **out**, **eo**, **omp**, **oc'h**, **int**
   - Past participle: **bet**

2. **mont** (to go):

   - Past participle: **aet**

3. **dont** (to come):
   - Present: **teuan**, **teuez**, **teu**, **teuomp**, **teuit**, **teuont**
   - Past participle: **deuet**

4. **gouzout** (to know):
   - Present: **gouzon**, **gouzout**, **goar**, **gouzomp**, **gouzoc'h**, **gouezont**

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Breton is Verb-Subject-Object (VSO):

**Debriñ a ra Yann avalou.**
(Eat does Yann apples)
"Yann eats apples."

However, Breton often uses a periphrastic construction where the verbal noun comes first, followed by a conjugated form of the verb **ober** (to do):

**Debriñ a ra Yann avalou.**
(Eating does Yann apples)
"Yann eats apples."

For emphasis, other elements can be fronted:

**Yann a zebr avalou.**
(Yann eats apples)
"It's Yann who eats apples."

**Avalou a zebr Yann.**
(Apples eats Yann)
"It's apples that Yann eats."

### Questions

Questions can be formed by using the particle **ha** at the beginning of the sentence:

**Ha debriñ a ra Yann avalou?**
"Does Yann eat apples?"

Or by using interrogative words:

**Petra a zebr Yann?**
"What does Yann eat?"

**Piv a zebr avalou?**
"Who eats apples?"

**Pegoulz e tebr Yann avalou?**
"When does Yann eat apples?"

### Negation

Negation is formed using the particles **ne** before the verb and **ket** after:

**Ne zebr ket Yann avalou.**
"Yann doesn't eat apples."

In colloquial Breton, **ne** is often omitted:

**Zebr ket Yann avalou.**
"Yann doesn't eat apples."

For emphasis, **tamm** can be used instead of **ket**:

**Ne zebr tamm Yann avalou.**
"Yann doesn't eat apples at all."

### Prepositions

Breton has a rich system of prepositions, many of which can be conjugated. For example, **da** (to):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **din** | **deomp** |
| 2nd | **dit** | **deoc'h** |
| 3rd masc. | **dezhañ** | **dezho** |
| 3rd fem. | **dezhi** | **dezho** |

Example:
**Reiñ a ran ul levr dezhi.**
"I give a book to her."

Other common prepositions include:

- **e** (in): **er gêr** (in the house)
- **war** (on): **war an daol** (on the table)
- **gant** (with): **gant ma breur** (with my brother)
- **eus** (from): **eus Brest** (from Brest)

### Conjunctions

- **ha** (and): **bara hag amann** (bread and butter)
- **pe** (or): **te pe kafe** (tea or coffee)
- **met** (but): **bihan met kreñv** (small but strong)
- **rak** (because): **Chomet on er gêr rak klanv e oan** (I stayed at home because I was sick)
- **ma** (if): **Ma teu an heol, ez in d'ar mor** (If the sun comes out, I'll go to the sea)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Breton are introduced by the particle **a** for subject relatives and **e** for object relatives:

- Subject relative: **Ar paotr a zo o kanañ** (The boy who is singing)
- Object relative: **An dra e welan** (The thing that I see)

## Vocabulary

2. Leoneg (Léonais): spoken in the northwest
3. Tregerieg (Trégorrois): spoken in the north
4. Gwenedeg (Vannetais): spoken in the southeast

The standard written form, Peurunvan (Unified Breton), was developed to bridge these dialects, although it is based primarily on Leoneg.

Some differences between dialects include:

- Pronunciation: e.g., **kazh** (cat) is [kas] in Kerneveg but [kah] in Gwenedeg
- Vocabulary: e.g., "potato" is **patatez** in Kerneveg but **aval-douar** in Leoneg
- Grammar: e.g., the future tense ending **-o** in most dialects becomes **-ou** in Gwenedeg

## Current Status

Breton is classified as a "severely endangered" language by UNESCO. However, revitalization efforts have been ongoing since the late 20th century:

1. Education: Diwan schools offer Breton-medium education from preschool to high school
2. Media: Radio and television programs in Breton, including on France 3 Bretagne
3. Publishing: Books, magazines, and newspapers in Breton
4. Technology: Breton language interfaces for software and websites
5. Cultural events: Festivals, music concerts, and theatre performances in Breton

Despite these efforts, the number of native speakers continues to decline, and most Breton speakers today are bilingual with French.
