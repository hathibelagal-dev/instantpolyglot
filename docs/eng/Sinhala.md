# Sinhala

Sinhala (සිංහල, also known as Sinhalese) is an Indo-Aryan language primarily spoken in Sri Lanka by about 17 million people. It is one of the official and national languages of Sri Lanka, alongside Tamil. Sinhala has been influenced by various languages throughout its history, including Pali, Sanskrit, Tamil, and Portuguese.

## Writing System

Sinhala uses its own unique alphabet, known as the Sinhala script (සිංහල අක්ෂර මාලාව). The script is an abugida, where consonants have an inherent vowel that can be changed with diacritical marks.

### Consonants

The Sinhala script has 42 consonant letters:

| Letter | Romanized | IPA |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| ක | ka | /kə/ |
| ඛ | kha | /kʰə/ |
| ග | ga | /ɡə/ |
| ඝ | gha | /ɡʱə/ |

| ච | ca | /cə/ |
| ඡ | cha | /cʰə/ |
| ජ | ja | /ɟə/ |
| ඣ | jha | /ɟʱə/ |

| ස | sa | /sə/ |
| හ | ha | /hə/ |

Additionally, there are several consonants used mainly in Sanskrit and Pali loanwords:

| ඟ | ṅga | /ŋɡə/ |
| ඦ | ñja | /ɲɟə/ |
| ඬ | ṇḍa | /ɳɖə/ |
| ඳ | nda | /n̪d̪ə/ |
| ඹ | mba | /mbə/ |

### Vowels

Sinhala has 12 vowels, each with its own letter when written independently:

| Letter | Romanized | IPA |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| අ | a | /ə/ |
| ආ | ā | /aː/ |
| ඇ | æ | /æ/ |
| ඈ | ǣ | /æː/ |
| ඉ | i | /i/ |
| ඊ | ī | /iː/ |
| උ | u | /u/ |
| ඌ | ū | /uː/ |
| එ | e | /e/ |
| ඒ | ē | /eː/ |
| ඔ | o | /o/ |
| ඕ | ō | /oː/ |

When vowels are combined with consonants, they are represented by diacritical marks. For example:

- ක (ka) + ා (ā) = කා (kā)
- ම (ma) + ැ (æ) = මැ (mæ)
- ස (sa) + ි (i) = සි (si)

### Special Characters

- ඃ (visarga): represents a voiceless glottal fricative /h/ at the end of a word

## Pronunciation

### Vowels

Stress in Sinhala typically falls on the first syllable of a word, unless that syllable contains a schwa (/ə/), in which case the stress moves to the second syllable.

## Grammar

### Nouns

Sinhala nouns are inflected for number (singular and plural) and case. There are no grammatical genders.

#### Number

The plural is typically formed by adding a suffix to the singular form:

- **ළමයා** (ḷamayā) “child” → **ළමයි** (ḷamayi) “children”
- **පොත** (pota) “book” → **පොත්** (pot) “books”

Some nouns have irregular plurals:

- **මිනිසා** (minisā) “man” → **මිනිස්සු** (minissu) “men, people”

#### Case

Sinhala has several cases, including:

1. Nominative (subject)
2. Accusative (direct object)
3. Dative (indirect object)
4. Genitive (possession)
5. Instrumental (means or instrument)
6. Locative (location)

Example of case declension for **ළමයා** (ḷamayā) “child”:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | ළමයා (ḷamayā) | ළමයි (ḷamayi) |
| Accusative | ළමයා (ḷamayā) | ළමයින් (ḷamayin) |

Some adjectives can also function as predicates:

### Adverbs

Many adverbs in Sinhala are formed by adding the suffix **-ව** (-va) to adjectives:

- **හොඳ** (hoňda) “good” → **හොඳට** (hoňdaṭa) “well”
- **ඉක්මන්** (ikman) “quick” → **ඉක්මනින්** (ikmanin) “quickly”

### Word Order

The basic word order in Sinhala is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV):

**මම පොත කියවනවා** (mama pota kiyavanavā)
S    O    V
“I   book read”
“I read the book”

However, the word order can be more flexible in spoken Sinhala, especially for emphasis or in questions.
