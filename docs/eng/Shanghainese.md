# Shanghainese

Shanghainese (上海话 **Zånhae-ghó** [zɑ̃.hɛ ɦoʏ]) is a variety of Wu Chinese spoken in Shanghai and the surrounding Yangtze River Delta region. It belongs to the Taihu Wu subgroup and is mutually unintelligible with Mandarin Chinese. Shanghainese has approximately 14 million native speakers.

## Phonology

Shanghainese has a complex phonological system with a rich inventory of consonants, vowels, and tones.

### Consonants

| Manner | Labial | Alveolar | Alveolopalatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--------|--------|----------|----------------|-------|---------|
| Stop   | p pʰ b | t tʰ d   |                | k kʰ ɡ |         |
| Affricate |      | ts tsʰ dz | tɕ tɕʰ dʑ      |       |         |
| Fricative | f v  | s z      | ɕ ʑ            | x ɦ   | h       |
| Nasal   | m     | n        | ɲ              | ŋ     |         |
| Lateral |       | l        |                |       |         |

Note: The voiced stops and affricates (b, d, ɡ, dz, dʑ) are actually tenuis (unaspirated voiceless) in initial position, but voiced between vowels.

### Vowels

Monophthongs:
| Front | Central | Back |
|-------|---------|------|
| i y   | ɪ       | u    |
| e ø   | ə       | o    |
| ɛ     | a       | ɔ    |

Diphthongs: aɪ, aʊ, eɪ, øʏ, oʊ

### Tones

Shanghainese has five tones in citation form, but only two or three in connected speech due to tone sandhi:

1. Yin Ping (阴平): 53 (high falling)
2. Yang Ping (阳平): 34 (mid rising)
3. Shang Sheng (上声): 13 (low rising)
4. Yin Qu (阴去): 55 (high level)
5. Yang Qu (阳去): 12 (low dipping)

Examples:
- **纸** [tsɿ⁵³] "paper"
- **时** [zɿ²³⁴] "time"
- **试** [sɿ¹³] "to try"
- **四** [sɿ⁵⁵] "four"
- **是** [zɿ¹²] "to be"

### Tone Sandhi

Shanghainese has extensive tone sandhi rules. In a phonological word, only the first syllable retains its original tone, while subsequent syllables are reduced:

- If the first syllable is tone 1, 2, or 4, following syllables become tone 3 (high level).
- If the first syllable is tone 3 or 5, following syllables become tone 4 (low falling).

Example:
- **小姑娘** "little girl"
  - Citation form: [ɕiɔ⁵³ ku³⁴ niɑ̃²³⁴]
  - After sandhi: [ɕiɔ⁵³ ku⁵⁵ niɑ̃⁵⁵]

## Morphology

Shanghainese, like other Chinese languages, is largely isolating, with little inflectional morphology. However, it does have some derivational processes and grammatical particles.

### Word Formation

1. Compounding:
   - Noun + Noun: **饭店** [vɛ²³⁴ tɪ⁵⁵] "restaurant" (lit. "meal-shop")
   - Verb + Object: **睏觉** [kʰwən³⁴ kɔ⁵⁵] "to sleep" (lit. "sleep-sleep")

2. Affixation:
   - Diminutive suffix **儿** [ɲi²³⁴]: **盒儿** [hhɔ⁵³ ɲi⁵⁵] "small box"
   - Nominalizing suffix **头** [dəʏ²³⁴]: **枕头** [tsən³⁴ dəʏ⁵⁵] "pillow"

3. Reduplication:
   - Adjectives: **慢慢** [mɛ²³⁴ mɛ⁵⁵] "slowly"
   - Verbs: **看看** [kʰø³⁴ kʰø⁵⁵] "to take a look"

### Classifiers

Shanghainese uses classifiers between numerals and nouns, similar to Mandarin:

- **一本书** [ɦi²³⁴ pən³⁴ sɿ⁵⁵] "one book"
- **三张纸** [sɛ⁵⁵ tsɑ̃⁵⁵ tsɿ³⁴] "three sheets of paper"

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | 我 [ŋu²³⁴] | 阿拉 [ɑ⁵³ lɑ⁵⁵] |
| 2nd    | 侬 [nɔŋ²³⁴] | 伊拉 [ɦi²³⁴ lɑ⁵⁵] |
| 3rd    | 伊 [ɦi²³⁴] | 伊拉 [ɦi²³⁴ lɑ⁵⁵] |

Demonstrative pronouns:
- **搿个** [ɡəʔ⁴ ɡəʔ⁵⁵] "this"
- **埃个** [ɛ⁵³ ɡəʔ⁵⁵] "that"

### Verbs

Verbs do not conjugate for tense, person, or number. Tense and aspect are expressed through particles and context:

- Present continuous: Verb + **辰光** [zən²³⁴ kwɑ̃⁵⁵]
  **我吃辰光饭。** [ŋu²³⁴ tɕʰiʔ⁵⁵ zən⁵⁵ kwɑ̃⁵⁵ vɛ⁵⁵] "I am eating."

- Past tense: **拉** [lɑ⁵³] + Verb
  **我拉去上海。** [ŋu²³⁴ lɑ⁵³ tɕʰi⁵⁵ zɑ̃⁵⁵ hɛ⁵⁵] "I went to Shanghai."

- Future tense: **要** [iɔ³⁴] + Verb
  **我要去上海。** [ŋu²³⁴ iɔ³⁴ tɕʰi⁵⁵ zɑ̃⁵⁵ hɛ⁵⁵] "I will go to Shanghai."

### Adjectives

Adjectives can function as predicates without a copula:

**搿本书好看。** [ɡəʔ⁴ pən³⁴ sɿ⁵⁵ hɔ³⁴ kʰø⁵⁵] "This book is interesting."

Comparatives are formed with **比** [pi³⁴]:

**伊比我高。** [ɦi²³⁴ pi³⁴ ŋu²³⁴ kɔ⁵⁵] "He/She is taller than me."

Superlatives use **最** [tsøɪ³⁴]:

**伊是最高个。** [ɦi²³⁴ zɿ²³⁴ tsøɪ³⁴ kɔ⁵⁵ ɡəʔ⁵⁵] "He/She is the tallest."

## Syntax

### Word Order

Shanghainese generally follows an SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order:

**我吃饭。** [ŋu²³⁴ tɕʰiʔ⁵⁵ vɛ⁵⁵] "I eat rice."

Adverbs typically precede the verb:

**我经常去上海。** [ŋu²³⁴ tɕiŋ⁵⁵ zɑ̃²³⁴ tɕʰi⁵⁵ zɑ̃⁵⁵ hɛ⁵⁵] "I often go to Shanghai."

### Topic-Comment Structure

Like many Chinese languages, Shanghainese allows for topic-comment structures:

**饭，我吃好了。** [vɛ²³⁴ | ŋu²³⁴ tɕʰiʔ⁵⁵ hɔ³⁴ləʔ⁵⁵] "As for the meal, I've finished eating."

### Questions

Yes-no questions are formed by adding the particle **伐** [vɑʔ⁵⁵] at the end of a statement:

**侬去上海伐？** [nɔŋ²³⁴ tɕʰi⁵⁵ zɑ̃⁵⁵ hɛ⁵⁵ vɑʔ⁵⁵] "Are you going to Shanghai?"

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns in situ:

**侬吃啥个？** [nɔŋ²³⁴ tɕʰiʔ⁵⁵ sɑʔ⁴ ɡəʔ⁵⁵] "What are you eating?"

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed by placing **勿** [vəʔ⁴] before the verb:

**我勿去。** [ŋu²³⁴ vəʔ⁴ tɕʰi⁵⁵] "I'm not going."

For past tense negation, **朆** [vɛ²³⁴] is used:

**我朆去过。** [ŋu²³⁴ vɛ²³⁴ tɕʰi⁵⁵ ku⁵⁵] "I haven't been there before."

### Serial Verb Constructions

Shanghainese makes extensive use of serial verb constructions:

**我去买书。** [ŋu²³⁴ tɕʰi⁵⁵ mɛ²³⁴ sɿ⁵⁵] "I go to buy books."

### Passive Voice

The passive is formed using **被** [bəɪ²³⁴] or **拨** [pəʔ⁴]:

**书拨我买脱了。** [sɿ⁵⁵ pəʔ⁴ ŋu²³⁴ mɛ²³⁴ təʔ⁵⁵ ləʔ⁵⁵] "The book was bought by me."

## Vocabulary

Shanghainese vocabulary shows influence from various sources, including Classical Chinese, other Wu dialects, and loanwords from English and other languages.

### Native Vocabulary

Many basic words differ from Mandarin:

- "to eat": **吃** [tɕʰiʔ⁵⁵] (cf. Mandarin 吃 chī)
- "to speak": **讲** [kɑ̃³⁴] (cf. Mandarin 说 shuō)
- "thing": **物事** [məʔ⁴ zɿ²³⁴] (cf. Mandarin 东西 dōngxi)

### Classical Chinese Retention

Some words preserved from Classical Chinese are still used in everyday Shanghainese:

- **宁** [niŋ²³⁴] "you" (polite, cf. Mandarin 您 nín)
- **勿** [vəʔ⁴] "not" (cf. Mandarin 不 bù)

### Loanwords

Shanghainese has borrowed words from various languages:

1. English:
   - **摩斯** [mu⁵³ sɿ⁵⁵] "morse (code)"
   - **沙发** [sɔ⁵³ fɑʔ⁵⁵] "sofa"

2. French:
   - **芭蕾** [pɔ⁵³ lɛ²³⁴] "ballet"

3. Russian:
   - **布拉吉** [pu³⁴ lɑʔ⁵⁵ tɕi²³⁴] "платье (dress)"

### Colloquial Expressions

Shanghainese has many unique colloquial expressions:

- **阿拉勿要浪** [ɑ⁵³ lɑ⁵⁵ vəʔ⁴ iɔ³⁴ lɑ̃²³⁴] "Let's not waste (time/money)"
- **侬朆浪到无** [nɔŋ²³⁴ vɛ²³⁴ lɑ̃²³⁴ tɔ³⁴ m̩²³⁴] "You haven't seen anything yet"

## Dialectal Variation

While this overview focuses on urban Shanghainese, there is significant variation within the greater Shanghai area:

1. Suzhou dialect influence: 
   In some western suburbs, features of the Suzhou dialect are present:
   - Use of [ŋ] instead of [ɲ]: **娘** [niɑ̃²³⁴] becomes [ŋiɑ̃²³⁴]

2. Ningbo dialect influence:
   In some southern suburbs, features of the Ningbo dialect can be heard:
   - Retention of [ʔ] in some words where urban Shanghainese has lost it

3. Subao dialect:
   Spoken on Chongming Island, this dialect retains some archaic features:
   - Preservation of the [ɲ] initial in words where urban Shanghainese uses [z]

## Writing System

Shanghainese does not have a standardized writing system. When written, it typically uses Chinese characters, either borrowing standard characters used for Mandarin or using locally created characters.

1. Standard character usage:
   - **明天** [miŋ²³⁴ tʰi⁵⁵] "tomorrow"

2. Non-standard character usage:
   - **伐** [vɑʔ⁵⁵] (question particle, not used in this sense in Mandarin)

3. Locally created characters:
   - **㑚** [nɔŋ²³⁴] "you" (singular)
   - **勒** [ləʔ⁵⁵] (perfective aspect marker)

4. Phonetic loans:
   Some characters are used for their sound value rather than meaning:
   - **格** [ɡəʔ⁴] used as a demonstrative "this" (cf. Standard Chinese 这 zhè)

When writing Shanghainese using Latin script, various romanization systems have been proposed, but none have been officially adopted. The system used in this overview is based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) with some modifications for ease of typing.

## Phonological Processes

Shanghainese exhibits several interesting phonological processes:

1. Syllable contraction:
   In rapid speech, some common phrases undergo contraction:
   - **侬好** [nɔŋ²³⁴ hɔ³⁴] "hello" → [nɔ²³⁴]
   - **勿要** [vəʔ⁴ iɔ³⁴] "don't" → [viɔ³⁴]

2. Tone sandhi in compounds:
   Besides the general tone sandhi rules mentioned earlier, some specific compounds have their own patterns:
   - **小** [ɕiɔ³⁴] + **姐** [tɕia³⁴] → **小姐** [ɕiɔ²³⁴ tɕia¹²] "miss, young lady"

3. Consonant assimilation:
   In some contexts, consonants may assimilate to neighboring sounds:
   - **饭店** [vɛ²³⁴ tɪ⁵⁵] "restaurant" → [vɛ²³⁴ dɪ⁵⁵] in fast speech

4. Vowel reduction:
   Unstressed syllables may have their vowels reduced:
   - **勿晓得** [vəʔ⁴ ɕiɔ³⁴ təʔ⁵⁵] "don't know" → [vəʔ⁴ ɕɔ³⁴ təʔ⁵⁵] in casual speech

## Grammatical Particles

Shanghainese makes extensive use of sentence-final particles to express various grammatical and pragmatic meanings:
