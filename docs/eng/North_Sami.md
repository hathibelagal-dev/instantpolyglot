# North Sami

North Sami (Northern Sami, or simply Sami) is a Uralic language spoken by approximately 25,000 people, primarily in the northern parts of Norway, Sweden, and Finland. It is the most widely spoken of the Sami languages, which form a branch of the Uralic language family. North Sami has several dialects, but there is a standardized written form used across national borders.

## Spelling and pronunciation

North Sami uses a Latin-based alphabet with some additional letters. The pronunciation is generally consistent with the spelling, but there are some complex rules and sound changes to be aware of.

### Vowels

North Sami has a rich vowel system, including both short and long vowels, as well as diphthongs.

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
**a** | [a]
**á** | [aː]
**e** | [e]
**i** | [i]
**o** | [o]
**u** | [u]

The letter **y** is only used in loanwords and pronounced [y].

Common diphthongs include:

| Diphthong | Sound |
|-----------|-------|
**ea** | [ea]
**ie** | [ie]
**uo** | [uo]

### Consonants

North Sami has several consonants that may be unfamiliar to speakers of many European languages:

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
**č** | [tʃ]
**đ** | [ð]
**ŋ** | [ŋ]
**š** | [ʃ]
**ŧ** | [θ]
**ž** | [ʒ]

Other consonants are generally pronounced as in English, with some exceptions:

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
**c** | [ts]
**h** | [h] or [ç] depending on the position
**j** | [j]
**v** | [v] or [w] depending on the position

### Consonant gradation

One of the most characteristic features of North Sami phonology is consonant gradation, a system where consonants alternate between strong and weak forms in different grammatical contexts. This affects both spelling and pronunciation. For example:

- **giehta** ('hand', nominative) → **gieđa** ('hand', genitive)
- **loddi** ('bird', nominative) → **lotti** ('bird', genitive)

### Stress

In North Sami, the stress is always on the first syllable of a word: **guolli** [ˈɡuolːi] ('fish'), **boahtit** [ˈpoahtiht] ('to come').

## Morphology

North Sami is an agglutinative language, meaning that grammatical information is often expressed by adding suffixes to word stems. It has a complex system of declension and conjugation.

### Nouns

Nouns in North Sami have three numbers (singular, dual, and plural) and seven cases. The dual is used for exactly two items. There is no grammatical gender.

Here's an example declension for **guolli** ('fish'):

| Case | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| Nominative | guolli | guolle | guolit |
| Accusative | guoli | guliid | guliid |
| Genitive | guoli | guliid | guliid |
| Illative | guollái | guliide | guliide |
| Locative | guolis | guliin | guliin |
| Comitative | guliin | guliiguin | guliiguin |
| Essive | guollin | guollin | guollin |

Some points to note:

- The accusative and genitive are always identical.
- The dual and plural forms are identical in all cases except the nominative.
- The essive case is invariable across all numbers.

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in North Sami decline for case and number, including the dual. Here are the nominative forms:

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **mun** | **moai** | **mii** |
| 2nd | **don** | **doai** | **dii** |
| 3rd | **son** | **soai** | **sii** |

Demonstrative pronouns also exist and decline for case and number. For example:

- **dát** ('this')
- **diet** ('that', near the listener)
- **duot** ('that', away from both speaker and listener)

### Numbers

Cardinal numbers in North Sami are:

1: **okta**
2: **guokte**
3: **golbma**
4: **njeallje**
5: **vihtta**
6: **guhtta**
7: **čieža**
8: **gávcci**
9: **ovcci**
10: **logi**

Numbers decline for case when used with nouns. For example:

- **guokte guoli** ('two fish', nominative)
- **guovtti guollái** ('to two fish', illative)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in North Sami agree with the nouns they modify in case and number. They also have separate attributive and predicative forms. For example, with the adjective **ruoksat** ('red'):

Attributive: **rukses guolli** ('red fish')
Predicative: **guolli lea ruoksat** ('the fish is red')

The attributive form often differs significantly from the predicative form and must be learned separately.

### Verbs

North Sami verbs conjugate for person (1st, 2nd, 3rd), number (singular, dual, plural), tense (present, past), and mood (indicative, imperative, conditional, potential). They also have numerous non-finite forms.

Here's an example conjugation of the verb **boahtit** ('to come') in the present indicative:

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **boađán** | **boahte** | **boahtit** |
| 2nd | **boađát** | **boahtibeahtti** | **boahtibeahtet** |
| 3rd | **boahtá** | **boahtiba** | **bohtet** |

And in the past tense:

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **bohten** | **bođiime** | **bođiimet** |
| 2nd | **bohtet** | **bođiide** | **bođiidet** |
| 3rd | **bođii** | **bođiiga** | **bohte** |

The negative verb in North Sami is conjugated, while the main verb takes a special negative form. For example:

- **In boađe** ('I don’t come')
- **Eat boađe** ('You don’t come', singular)
- **Eai boađe** ('They don’t come')

#### Verb types

North Sami verbs can be categorized into different conjugation types based on their stem changes. Some common types include:

1. Bisyllabic verbs (e.g., **boahtit** 'to come')
2. Trisyllabic verbs (e.g., **muitalit** 'to tell')
3. Contracted verbs (e.g., **borrat** 'to eat')

Each type has its own pattern of stem changes in conjugation.

#### Aspect and Aktionsart

Unlike some languages that have a grammatical aspect (like the perfective/imperfective distinction in Slavic languages), North Sami expresses aspectual differences through derivational morphology, creating new verbs with modified meanings. This system is sometimes referred to as Aktionsart. For example:

- **borrat** ('to eat')
- **borralit** ('to eat quickly')
- **borrastit** ('to eat a little')

#### Non-finite forms

North Sami has several non-finite verb forms, including:

1. Infinitive: **boahtit** ('to come')
2. Perfect participle: **boahtán** ('come', as in 'has come')
3. Present participle: **boahtti** ('coming')
4. Action essive: **boahtime** ('coming', as in 'while coming')
5. Verbal noun: **boahtin** ('coming', the act of)

These forms are used in various complex constructions and to form compound tenses.

## Syntax

North Sami generally follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, although this can be flexible due to the case system. For example:

- **Mun guoli boran** ('I fish eat', meaning 'I eat fish')

However, in main clauses, the verb often moves to the second position (V2 word order), similar to Germanic languages:

- **Mun boran guoli** ('I eat fish')

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the question particle **-go** to the first element of the sentence:

- **Boađátgo odne?** ('Are you coming today?')

Wh-questions use interrogative words at the beginning of the sentence:

- **Goas don boađát?** ('When are you coming?')

### Negation

Negation in North Sami is expressed using a negative verb that conjugates for person and number, while the main verb takes a special connegative form:

- **In máhte sámegiela** ('I don’t know Sami language')
- **Ii son boađe** ('He/she doesn’t come')

### Case usage

The rich case system in North Sami allows for expressing various semantic relationships:

Nominative is used for the subject:
- **Nieida boahtá** ('The girl comes')

Accusative is used for the direct object:
- **Mun oainnán nieidda** ('I see the girl')

Genitive expresses possession:
- **nieidda girji** ('the girl's book')

Illative indicates motion into or onto something:
- **Mun manan stohpui** ('I go into the house')

Locative indicates location or motion from something:
- **Mun lean stohpus** ('I am in the house')
- **Mun boađán stohpus** ('I come from the house')

Comitative expresses accompaniment or instrument:
- **Mun boađán ustibiin** ('I come with a friend')
- **Mun čálán beannáin** ('I write with a pen')

Essive expresses a temporary state:
- **Son bargá oahpaheaddjin** ('He works as a teacher')

### Possession

Possession in North Sami is typically expressed using the genitive case:

- **mu girji** ('my book', literally 'book of me')

There's also a set of possessive suffixes that can be added to nouns, although these are less common in modern North Sami:

- **girján** ('my book')
- **girját** ('your book')
- **girjis** ('his/her book')

### Comparison

Comparatives and superlatives in North Sami are formed by adding suffixes to the adjective stem:

- Positive: **buorre** ('good')
- Comparative: **buoret** ('better')
- Superlative: **buoremus** ('best')

The object of comparison is put in the locative case:

- **Dát lea buoret dus** ('This is better than you', literally 'This is better from you')

## Vocabulary

North Sami vocabulary reflects the traditional lifestyle and environment of the Sami people, with many words related to reindeer herding, nature, and Arctic conditions. However, it has also adapted to modern life and borrowed words from neighboring languages.

Some characteristic vocabulary areas include:

1. Reindeer-related terms:
   - **boazu** ('reindeer')
   - **áldu** ('female reindeer')
   - **várit** ('to drive a reindeer herd')

2. Snow and ice terms:
   - **muohta** ('snow')
   - **vahca** ('wet snow')
   - **skárta** ('snowdrift')

3. Nature and landscape:
   - **duottar** ('tundra')
   - **vuopmi** ('forest')
   - **jávri** ('lake')

4. Traditional activities:
   - **duodji** ('handicraft')
   - **juoigan** ('traditional Sami singing')
   - **goahti** ('traditional Sami tent')

Loanwords have entered North Sami from various sources:

1. Norse/Scandinavian:
   - **gáfe** ('coffee')
   - **skuvla** ('school')

2. Finnish:
   - **bearjadat** ('Friday')

3. Russian (especially in the eastern dialects):
   - **poasta** ('post office')

4. English (recent borrowings):
   - **dihtor** ('computer')

Many words have been created to describe modern concepts using native roots:

- **giehtatelefovdna** ('mobile phone', literally 'hand telephone')
- **diehtojuohkinteknologiija** ('information technology', literally 'knowledge-sharing technology')

## Dialects

While there is a standardized written form of North Sami, spoken dialects can vary significantly. Some major dialect divisions include:

1. Western (Finnmark) dialects
2. Eastern (Torne) dialects
3. Sea Sami dialects

Differences between dialects can involve vocabulary, pronunciation, and even some grammatical features. For instance:

- The word for 'fish' is **guolli** in most dialects, but **kuoli** in some eastern dialects.
- Some dialects maintain a distinction between **š** [ʃ] and **ž** [ʒ], while others have merged these sounds.
- The dual number is less used in some southern dialects.

## Writing system

The modern North Sami orthography was standardized in 1979 and is used across national borders. It uses the Latin alphabet with some additional letters:

**A Á B C Č D Đ E F G H I J K L M N Ŋ O P R S Š T Ŧ U V Z Ž**

Earlier orthographies varied between countries, which can still be seen in some place names and surnames.

## Phonological processes

### Consonant gradation

Consonant gradation is a key feature of North Sami phonology. It involves alternations between “strong” and “weak” grade consonants in different grammatical forms of words. This affects both pronunciation and spelling. Some examples:

- **girji** ('book', nominative) → **girjji** (genitive/accusative)
- **loddi** ('bird', nominative) → **lotti** (genitive/accusative)
- **johka** ('river', nominative) → **joga** (genitive/accusative)

The gradation patterns can be quite complex and are an essential part of North Sami grammar.

### Vowel alternation

Some words in North Sami undergo vowel changes in different grammatical forms. This is particularly noticeable in verbs:

- **boahtit** ('to come') → **bohten** ('I came')
- **mannat** ('to go') → **manai** ('he/she went')

### Diphthong simplification

In certain grammatical forms, diphthongs may simplify to single vowels:

- **giehta** ('hand', nominative) → **gieđa** (genitive/accusative)

## Syntax peculiarities

### Object marking

In North Sami, the object of a sentence can be in either the accusative or nominative case, depending on various factors including aspect and definiteness:

- **Mun lohken girjji** ('I read a/the book', accusative)
- **Mun in lohkan girji** ('I didn't read a/the book', nominative)

### Congruence

Numerals above 'one' traditionally take the noun in the singular, not plural:

- **guokte guolli** ('two fish', literally 'two fish[singular]')

### Non-verbal predication

For present tense 'to be' sentences, North Sami often omits the copula:

- **Son oahpaheaddji** ('He [is] a teacher')

However, the copula **leat** is used in other tenses:

- **Son lei oahpaheaddji** ('He was a teacher')

### Impersonal constructions

North Sami uses several impersonal constructions to express ideas without specifying a subject:

1. The use of 3rd person singular:
   - **Olgun arvá** ('It's raining outside', literally 'Outside rains')

2. The use of the passive voice:
   - **Dás borrojuvvo guolli** ('Fish is eaten here')

3. The use of the generic 2nd person singular:
   - **Go don boađát deike, de oainnát várrečohka** ('When you come here, you see the mountain peak', meaning 'When one comes here, one sees the mountain peak')

### Word order in subordinate clauses

While main clauses often follow a V2 (verb-second) word order, subordinate clauses typically maintain an SOV order:

- Main clause: **Mun dieđán ahte...** ('I know that...')
- Subordinate clause: **...don ikte bohtet** ('...you yesterday came')

### Topic prominence

North Sami can be considered a topic-prominent language, meaning that the topic of a sentence (what is being talked about) is often emphasized by placing it at the beginning of the sentence:

- **Dan girjji mun lean lohkan** ('That book, I have read')

## Derivational morphology

North Sami has a rich system of derivational morphology, allowing for the creation of new words from existing stems:

1. Diminutives: formed with suffixes like **-š** or **-ž**
   - **mánná** ('child') → **mánnáš** ('little child')

2. Augmentatives: formed with suffixes like **-hahtti**
   - **stuoris** ('big') → **stuorrahatti** ('huge')

3. Verbal nouns: formed with suffixes like **-n**
   - **borrat** ('to eat') → **borran** ('eating')

4. Causatives: formed with suffixes like **-hit**
   - **boahtit** ('to come') → **boahtihit** ('to make come, to bring')

5. Reflexives: formed with suffixes like **-dit**
   - **bassat** ('to wash') → **bassadit** ('to wash oneself')

6. Frequentatives: formed with suffixes like **-dit** or **-llat**
   - **borrat** ('to eat') → **borradit** ('to eat repeatedly')

## Particles and discourse markers

North Sami uses various particles and discourse markers to add nuance to sentences:

1. **ge/ge**: adds emphasis, similar to 'even' or 'also'
   - **In munges dieđe** ('Even I don’t know')

2. **han**: indicates that information is known or obvious
   - **Dat han lea čielggas** ('That is obvious, as we know')

3. **bat**: used in questions to express surprise or curiosity
   - **Maid bat don dagat dáppe?** ('What are you doing here?')

4. **gal**: used for emphasis or reassurance
   - **Mun gal boađán** ('I will come, for sure')

## Idiomatic expressions

North Sami has many idiomatic expressions, often reflecting traditional Sami culture:

- **Biegga njuolgá** (literally 'The wind straightens', meaning 'Things are improving')
- **Ii oro sátni sánis** (literally 'The word doesn’t stay on the word', meaning 'He/she doesn’t keep promises')
- **Borrat bohccobierggu váibmui** (literally 'To eat reindeer meat to the heart', meaning 'To be satisfied')

## Code-switching and language contact

Due to the multilingual environment in which North Sami is spoken, code-switching (alternating between languages within a conversation or even a single sentence) is common among speakers. This often involves switching between North Sami and the majority language of the country (Norwegian, Swedish, or Finnish).

Example of code-switching with Norwegian:
- **Mun manan butihkkii for å kjøpe mielkki** ('I'm going to the store to buy milk', mixing North Sami and Norwegian)

## Metaphorical language

North Sami, like many languages, uses metaphorical language extensively. Many metaphors are based on the natural environment and traditional lifestyle:

- **Lea váibmu čalmmiid ovddas** (literally 'The heart is in front of the eyes', meaning 'to be very worried or anxious')
- **Čuoika ráigge mannat** (literally 'To go through a mosquito's hole', meaning 'to escape from a difficult situation')

## Politeness and formality

North Sami does not have a formal 'you' like some European languages. Instead, politeness is often expressed through verb choice, particles, and circumlocutions:

- Using the potential mood for polite requests: **Sáhtášitgo veahkehit mu?** ('Could you possibly help me?')
- Using particles like **amma** for polite suggestions: **Amma mii vuolgit dál?** ('Shall we go now?')

## Language revitalization efforts

North Sami, like many minority languages, has been the subject of revitalization efforts. These include:

1. Development of educational materials and curricula
2. Creation of media content (TV programs, radio shows, websites) in North Sami
3. Official recognition and use in public administration in some municipalities
4. Language nests and immersion programs for children

These efforts have led to an increase in the number of younger speakers and a strengthening of the language's status.

## Influence on majority languages

North Sami has influenced the majority languages in its area, particularly in terms of vocabulary related to northern conditions and Sami culture:

- Norwegian: **joik** (from North Sami **juoigan**, traditional Sami singing)
- Swedish: **nåjd** (from North Sami **noaidi**, 'shaman')
- Finnish: **suopunki** (from North Sami **suohpan**, 'lasso')

## Challenges in translation

Translating between North Sami and non-Uralic languages can present challenges due to differences in grammar and vocabulary:

1. The dual number often has no direct equivalent in target languages.
2. The rich case system can be difficult to render accurately in languages with fewer cases.
3. Many culture-specific terms, especially related to reindeer herding or Arctic conditions, may lack direct equivalents.

Example:
- **Moai vuolgge duoddarii** ('We two are going to the tundra')
   - The dual 'we two' and the specific landscape term 'duottar' can be challenging to translate concisely.

## Orthographic conventions

While the basic orthography of North Sami is standardized, there are some variations and conventions to be aware of:

1. Proper nouns are capitalized, but adjectives derived from them are not:
   - **Suopma** ('Finland') but **suopmelaš** ('Finnish')

2. Compound words are generally written as one word:
   - **davvisámegiella** ('North Sami language')

3. The hyphen is used in certain compound constructions, particularly with numbers:
   - **guokte-golbma beaivvi** ('two-three days')

4. Abbreviations generally follow the patterns of the majority languages, but some are specific to North Sami:
   - **omd.** for **ovdamearkka dihte** ('for example')

## Challenges for learners

Learners of North Sami often find certain aspects of the language particularly challenging:

1. The complex system of consonant gradation
2. The use of three numbers (singular, dual, plural)
3. The rich case system
4. The differences between attributive and predicative forms of adjectives
5. The system of verbal derivation and aspectual distinctions
6. The vowel alternations in different grammatical forms

However, learners often find that the regular stress pattern (always on the first syllable) and the generally phonetic spelling system are helpful aspects of the language.
