# Ancient Greek

Ancient Greek refers to the language spoken in ancient Greece from around 1500 BCE to 300 CE. It is part of the Indo-European language family and is the ancestor of Modern Greek. Ancient Greek was widely used throughout the Mediterranean world and was the language of philosophy, literature, and science in the ancient Western world.

## Dialects

Ancient Greek had several major dialects:

1. Attic: Spoken in Athens and the surrounding region of Attica. This became the standard form for literature and was the basis for Koine Greek.
2. Ionic: Closely related to Attic, used in the Aegean islands and Asia Minor.
3. Doric: Spoken in the Peloponnese, Crete, and other southern regions.
4. Aeolic: Used in Thessaly, Boeotia, and some northern areas.

This overview will focus primarily on Attic Greek, as it was the most influential dialect.

## Writing System

Ancient Greek was written using the Greek alphabet, which developed from the Phoenician script around the 8th century BCE. The alphabet consists of 24 letters:

Α α (alpha), Β β (beta), Γ γ (gamma), Δ δ (delta), Ε ε (epsilon), Ζ ζ (zeta), Η η (eta), Θ θ (theta), Ι ι (iota), Κ κ (kappa), Λ λ (lambda), Μ μ (mu), Ν ν (nu), Ξ ξ (xi), Ο ο (omicron), Π π (pi), Ρ ρ (rho), Σ σ/ς (sigma), Τ τ (tau), Υ υ (upsilon), Φ φ (phi), Χ χ (chi), Ψ ψ (psi), Ω ω (omega)

Note: The lowercase σ is used within words, while ς is used at the end of words.

## Phonology

### Vowels

Ancient Greek had both short and long vowels:

Short vowels: α (a), ε (e), ι (i), ο (o), υ (u)
Long vowels: η (ē), ω (ō), ᾱ (ā), ῑ (ī), ῡ (ū)

There were also diphthongs:

αι (ai), ει (ei), οι (oi), υι (ui), αυ (au), ευ (eu), ου (ou)

### Consonants

Stops:
- Voiceless: π (p), τ (t), κ (k)
- Voiced: β (b), δ (d), γ (g)
- Aspirated: φ (ph), θ (th), χ (kh)

Nasals: μ (m), ν (n)

Liquids: λ (l), ρ (r)

Sibilant: σ (s)

Semi-vowels: ι (y), υ (w)

### Accent

Ancient Greek had a pitch accent system, which was later replaced by a stress accent in Koine Greek. There were three types of accents:

1. Acute (´): High pitch
2. Grave (`): Used on the final syllable when followed by another word
3. Circumflex (῀): Rising-falling pitch

Examples:
- **ἄνθρωπος** (ánthrōpos, “human”)
- **θεὸς εἶπεν** (theòs eîpen, “god said”)
- **δῶρον** (dôron, “gift”)

## Morphology

Ancient Greek was a highly inflected language with a complex system of declensions and conjugations.

### Nouns

Nouns in Ancient Greek were declined for:

- Three genders: masculine, feminine, neuter
- Three numbers: singular, dual, plural
- Five cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative

There were three main declension patterns:

1. First declension (α-stems, mostly feminine)
2. Second declension (ο-stems, mostly masculine and neuter)
3. Third declension (consonant stems, mixed genders)

Example: First declension, feminine noun **γλῶττα** (glôtta, “tongue, language”)

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **γλῶττα** | **γλῶτται** |
| Genitive | **γλώττης** | **γλωττῶν** |
| Dative | **γλώττῃ** | **γλώτταις** |
| Accusative | **γλῶτταν** | **γλώττας** |
| Vocative | **γλῶττα** | **γλῶτται** |

### Adjectives

Adjectives agreed with nouns in gender, number, and case. Most adjectives followed the first and second declension patterns.

Example: **ἀγαθός** (agathós, “good”)

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nom. Sg. | **ἀγαθός** | **ἀγαθή** | **ἀγαθόν** |
| Gen. Sg. | **ἀγαθοῦ** | **ἀγαθῆς** | **ἀγαθοῦ** |
| Dat. Sg. | **ἀγαθῷ** | **ἀγαθῇ** | **ἀγαθῷ** |
| Acc. Sg. | **ἀγαθόν** | **ἀγαθήν** | **ἀγαθόν** |

Comparative and superlative forms were often formed with suffixes:

- Comparative: -τερος, -τερα, -τερον
- Superlative: -τατος, -τατη, -τατον

Example:
- **σοφός** (sophós, “wise”)
- **σοφώτερος** (sophṓteros, “wiser”)
- **σοφώτατος** (sophṓtatos, “wisest”)

## Syntax

### Word Order

Ancient Greek had a relatively flexible word order due to its case system, but the most common order was Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). However, other orders were possible for emphasis or stylistic reasons.

Example:
**ὁ ἄνθρωπος τὸν κύνα ὁρᾷ** (ho ánthrōpos tòn kúna horâi)
“The man sees the dog”

### Cases

The case system was crucial for indicating grammatical relationships:

1. Nominative: Subject of the sentence
   **ὁ ἀνήρ ἐστι σοφός** (ho anḗr esti sophós)
   “The man is wise”

2. Genitive: Possession, source, partition
   **ἡ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς οἰκία** (hē toû andròs oikía)
   “The man's house”

3. Dative: Indirect object, instrument, location

   **ὁρῶ τὸν ἄνδρα** (horô tòn ándra)
   “I see the man”

5. Vocative: Direct address
   **ὦ ἄνερ** (ô áner)
   “O man!”

### Agreement

Adjectives, articles, and participles agreed with their nouns in gender, number, and case:

**ὁ ἀγαθὸς ἀνὴρ τοὺς σοφοὺς λόγους λέγει**
(ho agathòs anḕr toùs sophoùs lógous légei)
“The good man speaks wise words”

### Particles

Ancient Greek made extensive use of particles to convey nuance, emphasis, and logical relationships. Some common particles include:

- **μέν ... δέ**: “on the one hand ... on the other hand”
- **γάρ**: “for, because”
- **οὖν**: “therefore, then”
- **δή**: “indeed, certainly”
- **ἄν**: used with various moods to express potentiality or unreality

Example:
**ὁ μὲν πατὴρ σοφός ἐστιν, ὁ δὲ υἱὸς οὔ**
(ho mèn patḕr sophós estin, ho dè huiòs oú)
“The father is wise, but the son is not”

### Subordinate Clauses

Ancient Greek had various types of subordinate clauses, including:

1. Relative clauses:
   **ὁ ἀνήρ, ὃν εἶδον, σοφός ἐστιν**

   (ei toûto légeis, alēthê légeis)
   “If you say this, you speak the truth”

### Infinitives

Infinitives in Ancient Greek could be used as verbal nouns and in various constructions:

1. As subject or object:
   **τὸ μανθάνειν ἡδύ ἐστιν**
   (tò manthánein hēdú estin)
   “Learning is pleasant”

2. In indirect discourse:
   **ἔφη τὸν ἄνδρα ἐλθεῖν**
   (éphē tòn ándra eltheîn)
   “He said that the man came”

3. To express purpose:
   **ἦλθε μανθάνειν**

### Participles

Participles were extensively used in Ancient Greek for various functions:

1. Attributive:
   **ὁ γράφων ἀνήρ**
   (ho gráphōn anḗr)
   “The writing man”

2. Circumstantial (expressing time, manner, cause, etc.):

## Aspect and Tense

The Greek verb system was based on both tense (time of action) and aspect (type of action):

1. Present: Ongoing or repeated action
   **γράφω** (gráphō) - “I write, I am writing”

2. Imperfect: Past ongoing or repeated action
   **ἔγραφον** (égraphon) - “I was writing”

3. Future: Future action
   **γράψω** (grápsō) - “I will write”

4. Aorist: Simple occurrence of action, often in the past
   **ἔγραψα** (égrapsa) - “I wrote”

5. Perfect: Completed action with present relevance
   **γέγραφα** (gégrapha) - “I have written”

6. Pluperfect: Action completed before a point in the past
   **ἐγεγράφη** (egegráphē) - “I had written”

## Mood

Ancient Greek had four moods:

1. Indicative: Statements of fact

   **γράφοιμι** (gráphoimi) - “I might write”

4. Imperative: Commands
   **γράφε** (gráphe) - “Write!”

## Voice

There were three voices in Ancient Greek:

1. Active: Subject performs the action
   **λύω** (lúō) - “I loose”

2. Middle: Subject acts on or for itself
   **λύομαι** (lúomai) - “I loose for myself”

3. Passive: Subject receives the action
   **λύομαι** (lúomai) - “I am loosed”

Note that the middle and passive forms are often identical in the present and imperfect tenses.

## Specific Constructions

### Genitive Absolute

An independent participial phrase in the genitive case:

**τοῦ ἡλίου ἀνατέλλοντος, οἱ ὄρνιθες ᾄδουσιν**
(toû hēlíou anatéllontos, hoi órnithes áidousin)
“As the sun rises, the birds sing”

### Accusative and Infinitive

Used for indirect discourse:

**νομίζω τὸν ἄνδρα σοφὸν εἶναι**
(nomízō tòn ándra sophòn eînai)
“I think that the man is wise”

### Conditional Sentences

Four main types:

1. Simple present or past condition:
   **εἰ τοῦτο λέγεις, ἁμαρτάνεις**
   (ei toûto légeis, hamartáneis)
   “If you say this, you err”

2. Future more vivid:
   **ἐὰν τοῦτο λέγῃς, ἁμαρτήσῃ**
   (eàn toûto légēis, hamartḗsēi)

4. Past contrary-to-fact:
   **εἰ τοῦτο ἔλεξας, ἥμαρτες ἄν**
   (ei toûto élexas, hḗmartes án)
   “If you had said this, you would have erred”

## Vocabulary

Ancient Greek vocabulary has had a significant influence on modern languages, especially in scientific, technical, and academic terminology. Some examples:

1. **φιλοσοφία** (philosophía) - “love of wisdom” → philosophy
2. **δημοκρατία** (dēmokratía) - “rule of the people” → democracy
3. **βιολογία** (biología) - “study of life” → biology
4. **ψυχολογία** (psūkhología) - “study of the soul” → psychology
5. **θεολογία** (theología) - “study of god(s)” → theology

Many Greek roots are used to form compound words:

- **μικρός** (mikrós) - “small” + **σκοπέω** (skopéō) - “I look at” → microscope
- **τῆλε** (têle) - “far” + **φωνή** (phōnḗ) - “sound, voice” → telephone

## Dialects and Historical Development

### Mycenaean Greek

The earliest attested form of Greek, written in Linear B syllabic script (c. 1400-1200 BCE). Example:

**ko-no-so** = Κνωσός (Knōsós) - “Knossos”

### Homeric Greek

The literary dialect of the Homeric epics (Iliad and Odyssey), a mixture of different dialects. Example:

**μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος**
(mênin áeide theà Pēlēïádeō Akhilêos)
“Sing, goddess, the wrath of Achilles, son of Peleus”

### Classical Attic

The prestige dialect of Athens in the 5th-4th centuries BCE, used by many famous authors. Example:

**γνῶθι σεαυτόν**
(gnôthi seautón)
“Know thyself”

### Koine Greek

The common dialect that became widespread after Alexander the Great's conquests (3rd century BCE - 6th century CE). It was the language of the New Testament. Example:

**Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος**
(En arkhêi ên ho lógos)
“In the beginning was the Word”

## Literary Devices

Ancient Greek literature employed various literary devices:

1. Chiasmus: ABBA structure
   **χρυσὸν σπείρας, χρυσὸν θέριζε**
   (khrusòn speíras, khrusòn thérize)
   “Having sown gold, reap gold”

2. Hendiadys: Expressing a single idea with two nouns
   **βίᾳ καὶ κελεύσμασιν**
   (bíāi kaì keleúsmasin)
   “With forceful commands” (lit. “with force and commands”)

3. Tmesis: Separation of parts of a compound word
   **κατὰ πίονα μηρί᾽ ἔκηα**
   (katà píona mērí' ékēa)
   “I burned fat thighs” (for κατέκηα πίονα μηρία)

4. Litotes: Understatement by negating the opposite
   **οὐκ ἀγνοῶ**
   (ouk agnoô)
   “I am not unaware” (meaning “I know very well”)

## Pronunciation Changes

Ancient Greek pronunciation changed over time. Some key changes:

1. Loss of pitch accent: The tonal system was replaced by a stress accent.

2. Iotacism: Several vowels and diphthongs came to be pronounced as [i]:
   η, ι, ει, οι → [i]

3. Consonant shifts:
   - β (beta): [b] → [v]
   - δ (delta): [d] → [ð] (like “th” in “this”)
   - γ (gamma): [g] → [ɣ] or [j]

These changes led to the pronunciation of Modern Greek.

## Influence on Other Languages

Ancient Greek has had a profound influence on many languages, particularly in their scientific and technical vocabularies. Some examples:

1. English: 
   - “democracy” (δημοκρατία)
   - “philosophy” (φιλοσοφία)
   - “telephone” (τῆλε + φωνή)

2. Latin:
   - “gymnasium” (γυμνάσιον)
   - “historia” (ἱστορία)

3. Russian:
   - “философия” (философия from φιλοσοφία)
   - “демократия” (демократия from δημοκρατία)

4. Arabic:
   - “falsafa” (فلسفة from φιλοσοφία)
   - “qanun” (قانون from κανών)

This influence extends to the modern descendants of these languages and many others worldwide.
