# Kashubian

Kashubian (kaszëbsczi jãzëk) is a West Slavic language closely related to Polish. It is spoken by around 100,000 people, primarily in the Pomeranian Voivodeship in northern Poland, particularly in the region known as Kashubia (Kaszëbë). Kashubian is recognized as a regional language in Poland.

## Phonology and Orthography

Kashubian uses the Latin alphabet with several additional letters and diacritics.

- **zëma** [ˈzəma] (winter)
- **òkrãt** [ˈwɛkrɔ̃t] (ship)

### Orthographic Rules

1. The letter **ë** is never stressed and often represents a reduced vowel sound.
2. The letters **ò** and **ù** represent diphthongs [wɛ] and [wu] respectively.
3. The letter **ó** is pronounced the same as **u** [u].
4. Nasalization of **ą** is often lost before stops and affricates, similar to Polish.

Example:
**Mòja białka gôdô pò kaszëbskù.** [ˈmwɛja ˈbjawka ˈɡwedwɛ pwɛ kaˈʂəpsku]
(My wife speaks Kashubian.)

| 2nd pl. | gôdalë jesce | gôdałë jesce | - |

Future tense is formed using the auxiliary verb **bëc** (to be) and the infinitive or past participle:

   **pisac** (to write) → **napisac** (to write, perfective)

2. Suffixation:
   **rëba** (fish) → **rëbôk** (fisherman)

3. Compounding:
