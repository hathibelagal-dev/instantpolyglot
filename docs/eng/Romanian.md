# Romanian

Romanian (Romanian: **limba română**) is an Eastern Romance language spoken primarily in Romania and Moldova. It is the official language of Romania, Moldova, and the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in Serbia. Romanian is also an official language of the European Union.

## Phonology and Orthography

Romanian uses the Latin alphabet with five additional letters: Ă, Â, Î, Ș, and Ț.

### Vowels

Romanian has seven vowel phonemes:

| Letter | IPA | Description |

| U, u | /u/ | Close back rounded vowel |

Note: Â and Î represent the same sound. Î is used at the beginning and end of words, while Â is used in the middle.

### Consonants

Romanian has 22 consonant phonemes:

Example: **seara** /ˈse̯ara/ (the evening), **coală** /ˈko̯alə/ (sheet of paper)

### Stress

Stress in Romanian is not fixed but is generally predictable. It usually falls on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable.

Examples:
- **casă** /ˈkasə/ (house)
- **frumos** /fruˈmos/ (beautiful)
- **învățător** /ɨnvət͡səˈtor/ (teacher)

### Pronunciation Rules

1. C and G are pronounced /k/ and /ɡ/ before A, Ă, Â, O, U, but /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡ʒ/ before E and I.
   Example: **care** /ˈkare/ (which), **cine** /ˈt͡ʃine/ (who)

2. Ch and Gh are always pronounced /k/ and /ɡ/, even before E and I.
   Example: **che** /ke/ (what), **gheață** /ˈɡe̯at͡sə/ (ice)

3. E at the end of a word is usually pronounced /e/, not /ə/.
   Example: **mare** /ˈmare/ (big, sea)

4. The letter X is pronounced /ks/.
   Example: **taxi** /ˈtaksi/ (taxi)

## Morphology

Romanian has a rich inflectional morphology for nouns, adjectives, and verbs.

### Nouns

Romanian nouns have three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), two numbers (singular and plural), and three cases (nominative/accusative, genitive/dative, and vocative).

#### Gender

- Masculine: typically end in consonants or -u
  Example: **băiat** (boy), **codru** (forest)
- Feminine: typically end in -ă, -e, or -a
  Example: **fată** (girl), **carte** (book), **stea** (star)
- Neuter: behave like masculine in singular and feminine in plural
  Example: **scaun** (chair), **scaune** (chairs)

#### Number

Plurals are formed in various ways:

- Adding -i: **băiat** → **băieți** (boys)
- Adding -e: **carte** → **cărți** (books)
- Adding -uri: **scaun** → **scaune** (chairs)
- Vowel alternation: **masă** → **mese** (tables)

#### Case

Cases are mainly marked by articles and prepositions:

- Nominative/Accusative: **băiatul** (the boy)
- Genitive/Dative: **băiatului** (of/to the boy)
- Vocative: **băiete!** (boy!)

### Articles

Romanian has both definite and indefinite articles, as well as a unique feature called the “genitival article.”

#### Definite Articles

Definite articles are enclitic (attached to the end of nouns):

- Masculine/Neuter singular: -l, -le, -ul
  Example: **băiat** → **băiatul** (the boy)
- Feminine singular: -a
  Example: **casă** → **casa** (the house)
- Plural: -i, -le
  Example: **băieți** → **băieții** (the boys), **case** → **casele** (the houses)

#### Indefinite Articles

Indefinite articles precede the noun:

- Masculine/Neuter singular: **un**
  Example: **un băiat** (a boy)
- Feminine singular: **o**
  Example: **o casă** (a house)
- Plural: **niște**
  Example: **niște băieți** (some boys)

#### Genitival Article

The genitival article is used in possessive and genitival constructions:

- Masculine/Neuter singular: **al**
- Feminine singular: **a**
- Masculine plural: **ai**
- Feminine/Neuter plural: **ale**

Example: **casa a vecinului** (the neighbor's house)

### Adjectives

Adjectives agree with nouns in gender, number, and case. Most adjectives have four forms:

- Masculine singular: **frumos** (beautiful)
- Feminine singular: **frumoasă**
- Masculine plural: **frumoși**
- Feminine/Neuter plural: **frumoase**

Adjectives usually follow the noun they modify:
**o casă frumoasă** (a beautiful house)

### Pronouns

Romanian has several types of pronouns:

#### Personal Pronouns

| Person | Nominative | Accusative | Dative |
|--------|------------|------------|--------|

## Syntax

Romanian follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, but it allows for considerable flexibility due to its case system.

### Basic Sentence Structure

1. Simple declarative sentence:
   **Copilul citește o carte.** (The child reads a book.)

2. Question:
   **Ce citește copilul?** (What is the child reading?)

3. Negative sentence:
   **Copilul nu citește o carte.** (The child is not reading a book.)

### Complex Sentences

1. Relative clauses:
   **Cartea pe care o citește copilul este interesantă.**
   (The book that the child is reading is interesting.)

2. Conditional sentences:
   **Dacă va ploua, vom sta acasă.**
   (If it rains, we will stay at home.)

3. Reported speech:
   **El a spus că va veni mâine.**
   (He said that he would come tomorrow.)

### Clitic Doubling

Romanian often uses clitic doubling, where a clitic pronoun is used alongside a full noun phrase:

**Îl văd pe băiat.** (I see the boy.)

Here, **îl** is the clitic pronoun, and **pe băiat** is the full noun phrase.

### Topicalization

Romanian allows for topicalization, where elements can be moved to the beginning of the sentence for emphasis:

**Pe Maria am văzut-o ieri.** (Maria, I saw her yesterday.)

### Null Subject

Romanian is a null-subject language, meaning that pronouns can be omitted when they are understood from context:

**Merg la școală.** (I am going to school.)
Here, the pronoun “I” (**eu**) is omitted.

## Lexicon

Romanian vocabulary is primarily of Latin origin, but it has been influenced by various other languages throughout its history.

### Latin Inheritance

About 75-85% of Romanian words are of Latin origin. Examples:
- **apă** (water) from Latin “aqua”
- **pâine** (bread) from Latin “panis”

   - **n-am** instead of **nu am** (I don’t have)

2. Shortened forms:
   - **mi-e** instead of **îmi este** (it is to me)
   - **te-ai** instead of **tu te-ai** (you have)

3. Informal pronouns:
   - **mata** (informal “you”, between **tu** and **dumneavoastră**)

4. Slang terms:
   - **mișto** (cool, awesome)
   - **nasol** (bad, uncool)

5. Borrowings from English:
   - **ok** (okay)
   - **sorry** (sorry)

## Dialectal Variations

Romanian has several dialects, although the differences are not as pronounced as in some other languages. The main dialectal divisions are:

1. Daco-Romanian: The basis for standard Romanian, spoken in Romania and Moldova.

2. Aromanian: Spoken in parts of Greece, Albania, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria.

3. Megleno-Romanian: Spoken in a small area in Greece and North Macedonia.

4. Istro-Romanian: Nearly extinct dialect spoken in Croatia.

Within Daco-Romanian, there are several subdialects:

1. Moldavian: Spoken in Moldova and northeastern Romania
   - Characteristic: Softening of dental consonants before e and i
   Example: **dinte** (tooth) pronounced more like **ghinte**

2. Muntenian: Spoken in southern Romania
   - Characteristic: Tendency to change e to ă in some words
   Example: **pe** (on) sometimes pronounced as **pă**

3. Transylvanian: Spoken in central and northwestern Romania
   - Characteristic: Preservation of older forms and Hungarian influences
   Example: **mere** instead of standard **mere** (apples)

4. Banat: Spoken in southwestern Romania
   - Characteristic: Influence from Serbian
   Example: Use of **nă** instead of **ne** for “us”

5. Oltenian: Spoken in southwestern Romania
   - Characteristic: Archaisms and specific vocabulary
   Example: **milă** instead of **milostenie** (charity)

## Formal vs. Informal Language

Romanian makes a clear distinction between formal and informal language:

1. Pronouns of address:
   - Informal: **tu** (singular), **voi** (plural)
   - Formal: **dumneavoastră** (both singular and plural)

2. Verb forms:
   - Informal: **Tu vii?** (Are you coming?)
   - Formal: **Dumneavoastră veniți?** (Are you coming?)

3. Greetings:
   - Informal: **Salut!** (Hi!)
   - Formal: **Bună ziua!** (Good day!)

4. Titles:
   - Formal: **Domnul** (Mr.), **Doamna** (Mrs.), **Domnișoara** (Miss)
   Example: **Domnul Popescu** (Mr. Popescu)

## Phonological Processes

Romanian exhibits several phonological processes:

1. Vowel alternation:
   - **carte** (book) → **cărți** (books)
   - **seară** (evening) → **seri** (evenings)

2. Consonant alternation:
   - **urs** (bear) → **urși** (bears) [s → ʃ]
   - **fac** (I do) → **faci** (you do) [k → tʃ]

3. Vowel syncope:
   - **pădurice** → **pădurea** (small forest → the small forest)

4. Final devoicing:
   - **brad** [brad] (fir tree) → **brazi** [brazʲ] (fir trees)

## Writing System

Romanian uses the Latin alphabet with five additional letters:

- Ă ă: represents the sound /ə/
- Â â: represents the sound /ɨ/
- Î î: also represents /ɨ/, used at the beginning and end of words
- Ș ș: represents the sound /ʃ/
- Ț ț: represents the sound /t͡s/

Until 1993, there were some additional spelling rules:

- **î** was used more frequently instead of **â**
- **sunt** (I am) was spelled **sînt**
- **România** was spelled **Romînia**

The 1993 spelling reform changed these rules to reflect etymology more closely.

## Peculiarities of Romanian

1. Definite article: Unlike other Romance languages, Romanian places the definite article after the noun.
   Example: **copil** (child) → **copilul** (the child)

2. Neuter gender: Romanian is the only Romance language that preserved the neuter gender from Latin.
   Example: **scaun** (chair, neuter)

3. Balkan sprachbund features:
   - Postposed definite article
   - Merger of genitive and dative cases
   - Formation of future tense with “to want”
   - Lack of infinitive in many constructions, replaced by subjunctive

4. Retention of case system: Unlike most other Romance languages, Romanian retained a case system.

5. Count/non-count distinction: Romanian uses different forms for countable and uncountable nouns with numbers.
   Example: **doi copii** (two children) but **două pahare** (two glasses)

6. Vocative case: Romanian retained the vocative case from Latin.
   Example: **Ioane!** (John! - vocative)

7. Enclitic definite article in genitive constructions:
   Example: **casa vecinului** (the neighbor's house) - the definite article -ul is attached to vecin (neighbor)

8. T-V distinction: Like many European languages, Romanian distinguishes between familiar (tu) and polite (dumneavoastră) forms of address.

9. Animate/inanimate distinction: This affects the use of the accusative case marker “pe” with direct objects.
   Example: **Văd cartea** (I see the book) but **Îl văd pe Ion** (I see Ion)

10. Rich system of verbal aspects and moods: Romanian has preserved or developed a complex system of verbal aspects and moods, including the presumptive mood.
    Example: **o fi** (he/she might be - presumptive mood)

These peculiarities make Romanian a unique member of the Romance language family, showing both its Latin heritage and the influences of its geographical and historical context.
