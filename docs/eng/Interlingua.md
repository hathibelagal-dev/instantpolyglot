# Interlingua

Interlingua is an international auxiliary language created by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in 1951. It is designed to be easily understood by speakers of Western European languages, particularly those of Romance origin. Interlingua is not associated with any specific country or culture and aims to serve as a neutral medium for international communication.

## Phonology and Orthography

Interlingua uses the Latin alphabet and has a largely phonemic orthography. Its pronunciation is based on the average of its source languages, primarily Romance languages.

### Vowels

|--------|-------|-----|
| a | as in "father" | [a] |
| e | as in "bet" | [e] |
| i | as in "machine" | [i] |
| o | as in "more" | [o] |
| u | as in "rule" | [u] |

### Consonants

Most consonants are pronounced as in English, with some exceptions:

| Letter | Sound | IPA |
|--------|-------|-----|
| c | before e, i: as in "circle" | [s] |
| c | elsewhere: as in "cat" | [k] |

Exceptions:
- Words ending in -le, -ne, -re have the stress on the third-last syllable:

- Some words retain the stress of their source language:
  **caffé** [kaˈfe] (coffee)

However, the word order can be flexible for emphasis or stylistic reasons:

**Un pomo le puero mangia.** (An apple the boy eats.)

Wh-questions use interrogative words at the beginning of the sentence:

Negation is formed by placing **non** before the verb:

### Compound Tenses

Perfect tenses are formed with **haber** + past participle:

- Present perfect: **Io ha vidite le film.** (I have seen the movie.)
- Past perfect: **Io habeva vidite le film.** (I had seen the movie.)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by **que** (that, which) or **qui** (who):

**Le libro que io lege es interessante.** (The book that I am reading is interesting.)
**Le persona qui parla es mi amico.** (The person who is speaking is my friend.)

## Vocabulary

Interlingua's vocabulary is derived primarily from words common to English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese, with some influence from German and Russian. This makes it easily recognizable to speakers of Western European languages.

### Word Formation

Interlingua uses various affixes for word formation:

Prefixes:
- **dis-**: opposite or reversal (e.g., **facer** → **disfacer**, to do → to undo)
- **in-**: negation (e.g., **felice** → **infelice**, happy → unhappy)

### Sample Text

Here's a sample text in Interlingua to illustrate its structure and vocabulary:

**Le origines de interlingua**

**Interlingua es un lingua auxiliar international create in le annos 1950 per un equipa de linguistas sub le direction de Alexander Gode. Le objectivo era disveloppar un lingua que esserea facilemente comprensibile pro personas qui parla linguas romanic o anglese sin studio previe.**

**Un characteristica importante de interlingua es su naturalitate. In contrasto con altere linguas planificate como esperanto, interlingua non ha parolas o structuras artificial. Isto significa que un lector qui cognosce un o plus linguas romanic o anglese pote sovente comprender textos in interlingua sin haber studiate le lingua.**

**Hodie, interlingua es usate per un parve communitate international, principalmente pro communicationes scientific e cultural. Illo ha demonstrato su utilitate como un "ponte linguistic" inter personas de diverse origines linguistic, specialmente in Europa e Americas.**

Translation:

"The origins of Interlingua

Interlingua is an international auxiliary language created in the 1950s by a team of linguists under the direction of Alexander Gode. The objective was to develop a language that would be easily understandable for people who speak Romance languages or English without prior study.

The vocabulary of Interlingua is based on words common to the major Western languages, mainly English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. The grammar is greatly simplified compared to natural languages, with a regular verbal system and no exceptions.

An important characteristic of Interlingua is its naturalness. In contrast with other planned languages like Esperanto, Interlingua has no artificial words or structures. This means that a reader who knows one or more Romance languages or English can often understand texts in Interlingua without having studied the language.

Today, Interlingua is used by a small international community, mainly for scientific and cultural communications. It has demonstrated its usefulness as a "linguistic bridge" between people of diverse linguistic origins, especially in Europe and the Americas."
