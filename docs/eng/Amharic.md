# Amharic

Amharic (አማርኛ, **amarəñña**) is a Semitic language spoken primarily in Ethiopia. It is the official working language of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and serves as a lingua franca in many parts of the country. Amharic is written using the Ge'ez script, also known as Ethiopic.

## Writing System

Amharic uses the Ge'ez script, which is an abugida writing system. Each symbol represents a consonant-vowel sequence, and the basic form of the symbol usually denotes the consonant followed by the vowel ä (አ).

### Fidel (Alphabet)

The Amharic alphabet, known as fidel (ፊደል), consists of 33 basic characters, each of which has seven forms representing different vowels. This results in a total of 231 distinct symbols.

Here's a table showing the basic characters and their vowel forms:

| Basic | -ä | -u | -i | -a | -e | -ə | -o |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----| 
| ሀ     | ሀ  | ሁ   | ሂ  | ሃ   | ሄ  | ህ  | ሆ  |
| ለ     | ለ  | ሉ   | ሊ  | ላ   | ሌ  | ል  | ሎ  |
| ሐ     | ሐ  | ሑ   | ሒ  | ሓ   | ሔ  | ሕ  | ሖ  |
| መ     | መ  | ሙ   | ሚ  | ማ   | ሜ  | ም  | ሞ  |

### Vowels

The seven vowels in Amharic are:

1. ä (አ) - like the 'a' in “about”
2. u (ኡ) - like the 'oo' in “food”
3. i (ኢ) - like the 'ee' in “see”
4. a (ኣ) - like the 'a' in “father”
5. e (ኤ) - like the 'e' in “hey”
6. ə (እ) - like the 'u' in “but”
7. o (ኦ) - like the 'o' in “go”

### Consonants

Amharic has a rich consonant inventory, including ejectives and labialized consonants. Here are some examples:

- ተ (tä) - voiceless alveolar plosive
- ጠ (ṭä) - ejective alveolar plosive
- ቀ (qä) - voiceless velar plosive
- ቅ (q̠ä) - ejective velar plosive
- ጨ (č̣ä) - ejective palato-alveolar affricate
- ፀ (ṣ́ä) - ejective alveolar affricate

### Labialization

Some consonants have labialized counterparts, indicated by a small circle (ው) added to the character:

- ክ (kə) vs. ኩ (kʷə)
- ግ (gə) vs. ጉ (gʷə)
- ቅ (q̠ə) vs. ቁ (q̠ʷə)

## Grammar

### Nouns

Amharic nouns have two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural).

#### Gender

Most nouns ending in -a are feminine, while those ending in other vowels or consonants are typically masculine. However, there are exceptions.

Examples:
- **bet** (ቤት) - house (masculine)
- **mäkina** (መኪና) - car (feminine)

#### Plural Formation

Plurals are often formed by adding the suffix -očč (-ኦች) to the singular form:

- **lǝjj** (ልጅ) - child → **lǝjjočč** (ልጆች) - children
- **bet** (ቤት) - house → **betočč** (ቤቶች) - houses

Some nouns have irregular plurals:
- **säw** (ሰው) - person → **säwočč** (ሰዎች) - people

#### Definiteness

The definite article is expressed by adding the suffix -u (-ኡ) or -wa (-ዋ) to masculine and feminine nouns respectively:

- **bet** (ቤት) - a house → **betu** (ቤቱ) - the house
- **mäkina** (መኪና) - a car → **mäkinawa** (መኪናዋ) - the car

### Pronouns

#### Personal Pronouns

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | **ǝne** (እኔ) | **ǝñña** (እኛ) |
| 2nd    | **antä** (አንተ) (m) <br> **anči** (አንቺ) (f) | **ǝnnantä** (እናንተ) |
| 3rd    | **ǝssu** (እሱ) (m) <br> **ǝsswa** (እሷ) (f) | **ǝnnässu** (እነሱ) |

#### Possessive Suffixes

Possessive pronouns are formed by adding suffixes to nouns:

- 1st person singular: -e (-ኤ)
- 2nd person singular masculine: -h (-ህ)
- 2nd person singular feminine: -š (-ሽ)
- 3rd person singular masculine: -u (-ኡ)
- 3rd person singular feminine: -wa (-ዋ)

Examples:
- **bete** (ቤቴ) - my house
- **beth** (ቤትህ) - your (m) house
- **betš** (ቤትሽ) - your (f) house
- **betu** (ቤቱ) - his house
- **betwa** (ቤትዋ) - her house

### Verbs

Amharic verbs are complex and can express various grammatical categories through prefixes, suffixes, and stem modifications.

#### Root System

Verbs are based on a root system, typically consisting of three consonants. For example, the root s-b-r (ስ-ብ-ር) relates to “breaking”:

- **säbbärä** (ሰበረ) - he broke
- **yǝsäbral** (ይሰብራል) - he breaks
- **tä-säbbärä** (ተሰበረ) - it was broken

#### Perfective and Imperfective

Amharic distinguishes between perfective (completed actions) and imperfective (ongoing or habitual actions) aspects:

Perfective:
- **säbbärku** (ሰበርኩ) - I broke

Imperfective:
- **ǝsäbrallähu** (እሰብራለሁ) - I break (habitually)

#### Person, Number, and Gender

Verbs are conjugated for person, number, and gender. Here's an example with the verb “to eat” (መብላት, **mäblat**) in the perfective:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | **bällahu** (በላሁ) | **bällan** (በላን) |
| 2nd m  | **bällah** (በላህ) | **bällačču** (በላችሁ) |
| 2nd f  | **bällaš** (በላሽ) | **bällačču** (በላችሁ) |
| 3rd m  | **bälla** (በላ) | **bällu** (በሉ) |
| 3rd f  | **bällač** (በላች) | **bällu** (በሉ) |

#### Negation

Verbs are negated by adding the prefix al- (አል-) and the suffix -m (-ም):

- **bälla** (በላ) - he ate
- **al-bälla-m** (አልበላም) - he didn't eat

#### Causative

The causative is formed by geminating the first consonant of the root and adding the prefix a- (አ-):

- **mättä** (መጠጠ) - to drink
- **amättä** (አመጠጠ) - to make someone drink

#### Passive

The passive is formed by adding the prefix tä- (ተ-):

- **säbbärä** (ሰበረ) - he broke
- **täsäbbärä** (ተሰበረ) - it was broken

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Amharic typically follow the noun they modify and agree in gender and number:

- **tǝllǝq bet** (ትልልቅ ቤት) - big house
- **tǝllǝq mäkina** (ትልልቅ መኪና) - big car
- **tǝllǝqočč betočč** (ትልልቆች ቤቶች) - big houses

Some adjectives have different forms for masculine and feminine:

- **dägg lǝjj** (ደግ ልጅ) - good boy
- **däggit lǝjj** (ደጊት ልጅ) - good girl

### Syntax

#### Word Order

The basic word order in Amharic is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV):

**Lemma mäṣhaf anäbbäbä** (ለማ መጽሐፍ አነበበ)
Lemma book read
“Lemma read a book”

However, the word order can be flexible for emphasis or in certain constructions.

#### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the question particle **-nǝ** (-ን) to the verb:

- **mäṣhaf anäbbäbk?** (መጽሐፍ አነበብክ?) - Did you read a book?

Wh-questions use interrogative words, which typically come at the beginning of the sentence:

- **mǝn anäbbäbk?** (ምን አነበብክ?) - What did you read?

#### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are formed using the relative verb form, which is marked by the prefix yä- (የ-) and various suffixes:

**yänäbbäbkut mäṣhaf** (የነበብኩት መጽሐፍ) - the book that I read

#### Conjunctions

Common conjunctions include:

- **ǝnna** (እና) - and
- **wäyǝm** (ወይም) - or
- **gǝn** (ግን) - but

Example:
**ǝnna tämari näñ gǝn asdäragi aydälläm** (እና ተማሪ ነኝ ግን አስደራጊ አይደለም)
“And I am a student but not an organizer”

## Vocabulary

Amharic vocabulary includes many loanwords from various languages due to historical and cultural influences:

### Ge'ez Influence

Many words, especially those related to religion and literature, come from Ge'ez:

- **mäṣhaf** (መጽሐፍ) - book
- **qəddus** (ቅዱስ) - holy

### Arabic Loanwords

Due to long-standing contact with Arabic-speaking regions:

- **zamän** (ዘመን) - time, era (from Arabic زمن)
- **näfs** (ነፍስ) - soul (from Arabic نفس)

### Italian Loanwords

From the period of Italian occupation:

- **məkina** (መኪና) - car (from Italian macchina)
- **fasolia** (ፋሶሊያ) - green beans (from Italian fagioli)

### English Loanwords

Many modern terms, especially in technology and international concepts:

- **kompyutər** (ኮምፒውተር) - computer
- **internət** (ኢንተርኔት) - internet

### Native Amharic Words

Many common words are native to Amharic:

- **əndet** (እንዴት) - how
- **ahun** (አሁን) - now
- **tənant** (ትናንት) - yesterday

## Idiomatic Expressions

Amharic has many idiomatic expressions that reflect cultural values and ways of thinking:

1. **ənkwan dehna mäṭṭah** (እንኳን ደህና መጣህ) - Welcome (lit. “Well done for coming”)

2. **əjh yəmas** (እጅህ ይማስ) - Thank you (lit. “May your hand be blessed”)

5. **aynəh səga ayəbəla** (አይንህ ስጋ አይብላ) - Don’t be envious (lit. “May your eye not eat meat”)

## Phonological Processes

### Gemination

Consonant gemination (doubling) is phonemic in Amharic and can change the meaning of words:

- **alä** (አለ) - he said
- **allä** (አለ) - there is/are

### Palatalization

Some consonants undergo palatalization in certain environments:

- /t/ → [tʃ] before /i/ or /j/: **antši** (አንቺ) “you (f.)” is pronounced [antʃi]

### Labialization

As mentioned earlier, some consonants have labialized counterparts:

- **kʷǝrǝt** (ቁርጥ) - decision
- **gʷadäñña** (ጓደኛ) - friend

## Stress and Intonation

Stress in Amharic is generally predictable, falling on the penultimate syllable of the word:

- **mäkina** (መኪና) - car (stress on “ki”)
- **tämari** (ተማሪ) - student (stress on “ma”)

However, there are exceptions, particularly with some verb forms and loanwords.

Intonation in Amharic serves grammatical and pragmatic functions:

1. Declarative sentences typically have a falling intonation at the end.
2. Yes/no questions often have a rising intonation.
3. Wh-questions usually have a falling intonation.

Example:
- Declarative: **Addis Abäba hedku.** (አዲስ አበባ ሄድኩ።) - “I went to Addis Ababa.” (falling intonation)
- Yes/no question: **Addis Abäba hedkn?** (አዲስ አበባ ሄድክን?) - “Did you go to Addis Ababa?” (rising intonation)
- Wh-question: **wädät hedk?** (ወዴት ሄድክ?) - “Where did you go?” (falling intonation)

## Honorifics and Politeness

Amharic has a complex system of honorifics and polite forms, reflecting the hierarchical nature of Ethiopian society. This is expressed through verb conjugations, pronouns, and specific vocabulary.

### Polite Second Person

For polite address, Amharic uses the second person plural form:

- Informal: **antä** (አንተ) - you (singular)
- Polite: **ənnantä** (እናንተ) - you (plural, used as polite singular)

### Honorific Verb Forms

Verbs can take special honorific forms when addressing respected individuals:

- Regular: **yəbälallu** (ይበላሉ) - they eat
- Honorific: **yəbälallu** (ይበላሉ፡) - (honorific) he/she eats

Note that while these forms look identical in transcription, they are distinguished in the Ethiopic script by the addition of two dots (፡) in the honorific form.

### Honorific Titles

Titles are commonly used before names to show respect:

- **ato** (አቶ) - Mr.
- **wäyzäro** (ወይዘሮ) - Mrs.
- **wäyzärit** (ወይዘሪት) - Miss

Example:
**Ato Lämma mäṭṭu.** (አቶ ለማ መጡ።) - “Mr. Lemma came.” (using honorific verb form)

## Sentence Structure

### Copula

The copula (“to be”) in Amharic is expressed differently in the present and past tenses:

**yəhe bet käza yəbälṭal.** (ይህ ቤት ከዛ ይበልጣል።) - “This house is better than that one.”

Superlatives use **hullu** (ሁሉ) “all” or **bäṭam** (በጣም) “very”:

**yəhe bet kähullum yəbälṭal.** (ይህ ቤት ከሁሉም ይበልጣል።) - “This house is the best of all.”
**yəhe bet bäṭam ṭəru näw.** (ይህ ቤት በጣም ጥሩ ነው።) - “This house is very good/the best.”

   **yämminaggäräw säw af alläw; yämaynaggäräw säw joro alläw.**
   “The one who speaks has a mouth; the one who doesn’t speak has ears.”
   (Meaning: It's wise to listen more than you speak.)

2. **ቆየት ያለ ወተት አይበላሽም።**

   **and əjj č̣əbəṭ ayawäṭam.**
   “One hand doesn’t produce a clap.”
   (Meaning: Cooperation is necessary for success.)

## Dialects

While Standard Amharic, based on the dialect of Addis Ababa, is widely used, there are several regional dialects:

1. Gondar Amharic: Spoken in the Gondar region, characterized by certain phonological differences.

2. Gojjam Amharic: Used in the Gojjam area, known for some unique vocabulary and pronunciations.

3. Wollo Amharic: Spoken in Wollo, influenced by Oromo and other local languages.

4. Shewa Amharic: The basis for Standard Amharic, spoken in and around Addis Ababa.

Differences between dialects can include variations in vocabulary, pronunciation, and sometimes grammar, but they are generally mutually intelligible.

## Code-Switching and Borrowing

In urban areas, particularly Addis Ababa, code-switching between Amharic and English is common, especially among younger, educated speakers:

**Computer-u crash adärräggä.** (ኮምፒውተሩ crash አደረገ።) - “The computer crashed.”

This phenomenon reflects the increasing influence of English in education and technology.

In conclusion, Amharic is a rich and complex language with a long history and a unique writing system. Its grammatical structures, honorific system, and idiomatic expressions reflect the cultural values and social norms of Ethiopian society. As Ethiopia continues to develop and engage with the global community, Amharic is also evolving, incorporating new terms and concepts while maintaining its distinctive character.
