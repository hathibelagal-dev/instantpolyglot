# The Balkan Sprachbund

The Balkan Sprachbund, also known as the Balkan linguistic area, is a remarkable example of linguistic convergence among languages that are not necessarily closely related genetically. This phenomenon has resulted in shared grammatical features and lexical similarities among several languages spoken in the Balkan Peninsula, despite their diverse origins. The Sprachbund illustrates how prolonged contact between different linguistic communities can lead to structural similarities, even when the languages belong to different language families.

## Languages Involved

The core languages of the Balkan Sprachbund include:

1. Albanian (Indo-European, unique branch)
2. Bulgarian (Indo-European, Slavic)
3. Macedonian (Indo-European, Slavic)
4. Romanian (Indo-European, Romance)
5. Greek (Indo-European, Hellenic)
6. Serbo-Croatian (Indo-European, Slavic, particularly the Torlakian dialects)

Peripheral members or languages showing some Balkan features include:

1. Turkish (Turkic, particularly Balkan Turkish dialects)
2. Romani (Indo-European, Indo-Aryan, Balkan dialects)
3. Aromanian (Indo-European, Romance)
4. Megleno-Romanian (Indo-European, Romance)
5. Judezmo (Ladino) (Indo-European, Romance)

It's important to note that not all features are present in all languages, and the degree of "Balkanization" varies among these languages. Some languages, like Bulgarian and Macedonian, exhibit a high degree of Balkan features, while others, like Serbo-Croatian, show fewer Balkan characteristics.

## Shared Features

### 1. Postposed Definite Article

One of the most distinctive features of the Balkan Sprachbund is the postposed definite article. In contrast to many European languages where the definite article precedes the noun, in Balkan languages it is typically attached to the end of the noun.

Examples:

Albanian:
- Indefinite: **libër** (book)
- Definite: **libri** (the book)
- Indefinite: **vajzë** (girl)
- Definite: **vajza** (the girl)

Bulgarian:
- Indefinite: **град** (grad, city)
- Definite: **градът** (gradăt, the city)
- Indefinite: **маса** (masa, table)
- Definite: **масата** (masata, the table)

Romanian:
- Indefinite: **om** (man)
- Definite: **omul** (the man)
- Indefinite: **casă** (house)
- Definite: **casa** (the house)

Macedonian:
- Indefinite: **куќа** (kuḱa, house)
- Definite: **куќата** (kuḱata, the house)
- Indefinite: **маж** (maž, man)
- Definite: **мажот** (mažot, the man)

In Macedonian and Bulgarian, there are actually three forms of the definite article, used to indicate different degrees of definiteness or distance:

Macedonian:
- **човекот** (čovekot, the man - neutral)
- **човеков** (čovekov, this man - proximal)
- **човекон** (čovekon, that man - distal)

Bulgarian:
- **човекът** (chovekăt, the man - neutral)
- **човекa** (choveka, the man - casual speech)

Greek, which is part of the Sprachbund, retains its preposed definite article:
- **ο άνθρωπος** (o anthropos, the man)
- **η γυναίκα** (i gynaika, the woman)

### 2. Future Tense Formation

Many Balkan languages form the future tense using a construction that historically derives from a verb meaning "to want" or "to will", which has grammaticalized into an invariable particle.

Albanian:
- **do të shkoj** (I will go)
  do (want) + të (subjunctive particle) + shkoj (I go)
- **do të flas** (I will speak)
  do (want) + të (subjunctive particle) + flas (I speak)

Bulgarian:
- **ще отида** (shte otida, I will go)
  ще (shte, will) + отида (otida, I go)
- **ще говоря** (shte govorya, I will speak)
  ще (shte, will) + говоря (govorya, I speak)

Romanian:
- **voi merge** (I will go)
  voi (I will) + merge (go)
- **voi vorbi** (I will speak)
  voi (I will) + vorbi (speak)

Greek:
- **θα πάω** (tha pao, I will go)
  θα (tha, will) + πάω (pao, I go)
- **θα μιλήσω** (tha miliso, I will speak)
  θα (tha, will) + μιλήσω (miliso, I speak)

Macedonian:
- **ќе одам** (ḱe odam, I will go)
  ќе (ḱe, will) + одам (odam, I go)
- **ќе зборувам** (ḱe zboruvam, I will speak)
  ќе (ḱe, will) + зборувам (zboruvam, I speak)

It's worth noting that in some of these languages, like Bulgarian and Macedonian, this construction has largely replaced the older synthetic future forms.

### 3. Loss of Infinitive

Another striking feature is the replacement of the infinitive with subjunctive constructions. This is particularly evident in Bulgarian, Macedonian, Greek, and to a lesser extent in Albanian and Romanian.

Bulgarian:
- Instead of an infinitive "to read", Bulgarian uses:
  **да чета** (da cheta, that I read)
- "I want to sleep" is expressed as:
  **Искам да спя** (Iskam da spya, I want that I sleep)

Macedonian:
- "I want to write" is expressed as:
  **Сакам да пишувам** (Sakam da pišuvam, I want that I write)

Greek:
- Instead of an infinitive "to write", Greek uses:
  **να γράφω** (na grafo, that I write)
- "I want to eat" is expressed as:
  **Θέλω να φάω** (Thelo na fao, I want that I eat)

Albanian:
- **të shkruaj** (to write, lit. "that I write")
- "I want to drink" is expressed as:
  **Dua të pi** (I want that I drink)

Romanian retains the infinitive but also uses subjunctive constructions:
- Infinitive: **a scrie** (to write)
- Subjunctive: **să scriu** (that I write)
- "I want to sing" can be expressed both ways:
  **Vreau a cânta** or **Vreau să cânt** (I want to sing / I want that I sing)

This feature is particularly interesting because it represents a significant departure from the typical Indo-European pattern of using infinitives in such constructions.

### 4. Clitic Doubling

Clitic doubling is a phenomenon where a clitic pronoun appears in the same clause as the full noun phrase it refers to. This is common in several Balkan languages.

Bulgarian:
- **Книгата я чета.** (Knigata ya cheta, The book, I'm reading it.)
- **На него му казах.** (Na nego mu kazah, To him, I told him.)

Macedonian:
- **Јас го видов човекот.** (Jas go vidov čovekot, I saw the man, lit. "I him saw the man.")
- **Нему му реков.** (Nemu mu rekov, To him, I told him.)

Greek:
- **Το βιβλίο το διαβάζω.** (To vivlio to diavazo, The book, I'm reading it.)
- **Του Γιάννη του το είπα.** (Tou Gianni tou to eipa, To Giannis, I told it to him.)

Romanian:
- **Cartea o citesc.** (The book, I'm reading it.)
- **Lui Ion i-am spus.** (To Ion, I told him.)

Albanian:
- **Librin e lexova.** (The book, I read it.)
- **Agimit i thashë.** (To Agim, I told him.)

This feature is particularly interesting because it goes against the general tendency in languages to avoid redundancy. In these constructions, the object is effectively marked twice.

### 5. Evidentiality

Some Balkan languages have developed grammatical means to express the source of information (evidentiality). This is most prominent in Bulgarian and Macedonian, but traces can be found in Albanian and Turkish.

Bulgarian:
- Direct evidence: **Той дойде.** (Toy doyde, He came.)
- Reported information: **Той дошъл.** (Toy doshăl, He apparently came.)
- Inference: **Той бил дошъл.** (Toy bil doshăl, He must have come.)

Macedonian:
- Direct evidence: **Тој дојде.** (Toj dojde, He came.)
- Reported information: **Тој дошол.** (Toj došol, He allegedly came.)
- Inference: **Тој бил дошол.** (Toj bil došol, He must have come.)

Albanian has a similar system, although it's not as developed:
- Direct evidence: **Ai erdhi.** (He came.)
- Non-witnessed past: **Ai paska ardhur.** (He has apparently come.)

Turkish, while not a core Balkan language, has an extensive evidentiality system that may have influenced the Balkan languages:
- Direct evidence: **Geldi.** (He came.)
- Reported information: **Gelmiş.** (He has apparently come.)

This feature allows speakers to grammatically encode their relationship to the information they're conveying, whether they witnessed it directly, heard about it from someone else, or inferred it from evidence.

### 6. Case System Simplification

Many Balkan languages have undergone a simplification of their case systems. This is particularly evident in Bulgarian and Macedonian, which have almost entirely lost their case systems (except for pronouns).

Bulgarian and Macedonian now use prepositions instead of case endings:
- **на човека** (na choveka, to the man) instead of a dative case
- **от къщата** (ot kăshtata, from the house) instead of an ablative case

Romanian has retained more of its case system but has merged the genitive and dative cases:
- Nominative/Accusative: **casa** (the house)
- Genitive/Dative: **casei** (of/to the house)

Albanian still has a fairly complex case system, but it has been simplified compared to earlier stages of the language:
- Nominative: **shtëpia** (the house)
- Accusative: **shtëpinë**
- Genitive: **i/e/të/së shtëpisë**
- Dative: **shtëpisë**
- Ablative: **shtëpie**

Greek has maintained its case system to a large extent, but has lost the dative case:
- Nominative: **ο άνθρωπος** (o anthropos, the man)
- Genitive: **του ανθρώπου** (tou anthropou, of the man)
- Accusative: **τον άνθρωπο** (ton anthropo, the man as object)

This simplification of case systems is often attributed to the intense language contact in the Balkan region, which may have favored simpler morphological systems for ease of communication between speakers of different languages.

### 7. Mid-Central Vowel

Many Balkan languages have developed a mid-central vowel, often represented as "ă" or "ə".

Bulgarian: **ъ** as in **сън** (săn, dream)
- **път** (păt, road)
- **къща** (kăshta, house)

Romanian: **ă** as in **făină** (flour)
- **măr** (apple)
- **cărți** (books)

Albanian: **ë** as in **ëndërr** (dream)
- **bëj** (to do)
- **shqiptër** (Albanian)

While not universal across all Balkan languages (Greek, for instance, doesn't have this vowel), its presence in several languages of different branches is noteworthy.

### 8. Comparatives

Balkan languages often form comparatives analytically, using a particle meaning "more" rather than synthetic forms.

Bulgarian:
- **по-голям** (po-golyam, bigger)
- **по-бърз** (po-bărz, faster)

Romanian:
- **mai mare** (bigger)
- **mai rapid** (faster)

Greek:
- **πιο μεγάλος** (pio megalos, bigger)
- **πιο γρήγορος** (pio grigoros, faster)

Albanian:
- **më i madh** (bigger)
- **më i shpejtë** (faster)

Macedonian:
- **по голем** (po golem, bigger)
- **по брз** (po brz, faster)

This analytical construction contrasts with the synthetic comparatives found in many other Indo-European languages (e.g., English "bigger", Latin "maior").

### 9. Numerals

Many Balkan languages have a vigesimal counting system for the numbers 11-19, literally meaning "one over ten", "two over ten", etc.

Albanian:
- 11: **njëmbëdhjetë** (one over ten)
- 12: **dymbëdhjetë** (two over ten)
- 13: **trembëdhjetë** (three over ten)

Romanian:
- 11: **unsprezece** (one over ten)
- 12: **doisprezece** (two over ten)
- 13: **treisprezece** (three over ten)

Greek:
- 11: **έντεκα** (endeka, one and ten)
- 12: **δώδεκα** (dodeka, two and ten)
- 13: **δεκατρία** (dekatria, ten-three)

Bulgarian and Macedonian don't follow this pattern:
- Bulgarian 11: **единадесет** (edinadeset)
- Macedonian 11: **единаесет** (edinaeset)

This feature, while not universal across the Sprachbund, is notable for its presence in languages from different branches of Indo-European.

## Lexical Similarities

Beyond grammatical features, the Balkan Sprachbund is characterized by shared vocabulary items. These often include loanwords from Turkish, Greek, or other languages, as well as calques (word-for-word translations of expressions).

Some examples of shared words:

1. "Sheep cheese"
   - Bulgarian: **сирене** (sirene)
   - Romanian: **brânză**
   - Albanian: **djathë**
   - Greek: **τυρί** (tyri)

   - Bulgarian: **магаре** (magare)
   - Romanian: **măgar**
   - Albanian: **gomar**

3. "Spoon"
   - Bulgarian: **лъжица** (lazhitsa)
   - Romanian: **lingură**
   - Albanian: **lugë**

4. "Thousand"

5. "Good day" (as a greeting)
   - Bulgarian: **добър ден** (dobăr den)
   - Romanian: **bună ziua**
   - Albanian: **mirëdita**
   - Greek: **καλημέρα** (kalimera)

These shared expressions demonstrate how deeply the linguistic convergence in the Balkan Sprachbund goes, affecting not just grammar and vocabulary, but also idiomatic expressions.

## Phonological Features

While phonology is less affected by the Sprachbund than morphology and syntax, there are some shared phonological features:

1. Presence of the phoneme /ə/ (schwa) in many Balkan languages:
   - Bulgarian: **ъ** as in **сън** (săn, dream)
   - Romanian: **ă** as in **măr** (apple)
   - Albanian: **ë** as in **ëndërr** (dream)

2. Palatalization of consonants before front vowels:
   - Bulgarian: **бял** (byal, white) - /bʲal/
   - Romanian: **chiar** (even) - /kʲar/
   - Albanian: **qen** (dog) - /cen/

3. Final devoicing of obstruents in some languages:
   - Bulgarian: **град** (grad, city) is pronounced [grat]
   - Macedonian: **град** (grad, city) is pronounced [grat]

4. Lack of phonemic vowel length distinctions in most Balkan languages (unlike some other Slavic languages)

5. Presence of initial consonant clusters:
   - Bulgarian: **вторник** (vtornik, Tuesday)
   - Albanian: **vrapoj** (to run)
   - Greek: **φτερό** (ftero, feather)

   - Bulgarian: **хляб** (hlyab, bread)
   - Greek: **χέρι** (cheri, hand)
   - Albanian: **ha** (to eat)

7. Development of the phoneme /dz/ in some Balkan languages:
   - Macedonian: **ѕвезда** (dzvezda, star)
   - Greek: **τζάκι** (tzaki, fireplace)

8. Simplification of consonant clusters in some languages:
   - Romanian: **opt** (eight) from Latin "octo"
   - Albanian: **natë** (night) from Proto-Albanian *nakta

## Morphological Features

### 1. Vocative Case

While many case distinctions have been lost, the vocative case (used for direct address) is retained in several Balkan languages:

Bulgarian:
- **Иван** (Ivan) → **Иване** (Ivane)
- **майка** (mayka, mother) → **майко** (mayko)
- **приятел** (priyatel, friend) → **приятелю** (priyatelyu)

Romanian:
- **frate** (brother) → **frate!**
- **băiat** (boy) → **băiete!**
- **domnul** (mister) → **domnule!**

Albanian:
- **mik** (friend) → **mik!**
- **bir** (son) → **biro!**
- **zotëri** (mister) → **zotëri!**

Macedonian:
- **Петар** (Petar) → **Петре** (Petre)
- **татко** (tatko, father) → **татко!**
- **професор** (profesor) → **професоре** (profesore)

Greek:
- **Γιώργος** (Giorgos) → **Γιώργο** (Giorgo)
- **κύριος** (kyrios, mister) → **κύριε** (kyrie)
- **μητέρα** (mitera, mother) → **μητέρα!**

### 2. Diminutives

Balkan languages are rich in diminutive forms, often using multiple suffixes:

Bulgarian:
- **къща** (kăshta, house) → **къщичка** (kăshtichka, little house)
- **малък** (malăk, small) → **мъничък** (mănichăk, tiny)
- **момиче** (momiche, girl) → **момиченце** (momichentse, little girl)

Romanian:
- **casă** (house) → **căsuță** (little house)
- **mic** (small) → **micuț** (tiny)
- **fată** (girl) → **fetiță** (little girl)

Albanian:
- **shtëpi** (house) → **shtëpizë** (little house)
- **i vogël** (small) → **i vockël** (tiny)
- **vajzë** (girl) → **vajzëz** (little girl)

Greek:
- **σπίτι** (spiti, house) → **σπιτάκι** (spitaki, little house)
- **μικρός** (mikros, small) → **μικρούλης** (mikroulis, tiny)
- **κορίτσι** (koritsi, girl) → **κοριτσάκι** (koritsaki, little girl)

- **мал** (mal, small) → **малечок** (malečok, tiny)
- **девојче** (devojče, girl) → **девојченце** (devojčence, little girl)

### 3. Verbal Aspect

While not unique to the Balkan Sprachbund, the distinction between perfective and imperfective aspects is important in many Balkan languages, especially the Slavic ones:

Bulgarian:
- Imperfective: **чета** (cheta, I read/am reading)
- Perfective: **прочета** (procheta, I will read/finish reading)
- Imperfective: **пиша** (pisha, I write/am writing)
- Perfective: **напиша** (napisha, I will write/finish writing)

Macedonian:
- Imperfective: **читам** (čitam, I read/am reading)
- Perfective: **прочитам** (pročitam, I will read/finish reading)
- Imperfective: **пишувам** (pišuvam, I write/am writing)
- Perfective: **напишам** (napišam, I will write/finish writing)

Albanian also distinguishes between perfective and imperfective aspects, though not as systematically as the Slavic languages:
- Imperfective: **lexoj** (I read/am reading)
- Perfective: **lexova** (I read/finished reading)
- Imperfective: **shkruaj** (I write/am writing)
- Perfective: **shkrova** (I wrote/finished writing)

Greek distinguishes aspect in all tenses:
- Imperfective present: **γράφω** (grafo, I write/am writing)
- Perfective future: **θα γράψω** (tha grapso, I will write)
- Imperfective past: **έγραφα** (egrafa, I was writing)
- Perfective past: **έγραψα** (egrapsa, I wrote)

Romanian doesn't have a systematic aspectual distinction, but uses different tenses to convey similar meanings:
- Imperfective-like: **scriam** (I was writing)
- Perfective-like: **am scris** (I wrote/have written)

### 4. Reduplication

Some Balkan languages use reduplication for emphasis or to create distributive meanings:

Bulgarian:
- **бял-бял** (byal-byal, very white)
- **тук-таме** (tuk-tame, here and there)

Greek:
- **σιγά-σιγά** (siga-siga, very slowly)
- **πότε-πότε** (pote-pote, from time to time)

Albanian:
- **dalë-dalë** (very slowly)
- **herë-herë** (from time to time)

Turkish (influencing other Balkan languages):
- **yavaş yavaş** (very slowly)
- **tek tek** (one by one)

## Syntactic Features

### 1. Pro-drop

Most Balkan languages are pro-drop languages, meaning that subject pronouns can be omitted when they are inferable from context:

Bulgarian:
- **(Аз) чета книга.** ((Az) cheta kniga, I am reading a book.)
- **(Ние) говорим български.** ((Nie) govorim balgarski, We speak Bulgarian.)

Greek:
- **(Εγώ) διαβάζω ένα βιβλίο.** ((Ego) diavazo ena vivlio, I am reading a book.)
- **(Εμείς) μιλάμε ελληνικά.** ((Emeis) milame ellinika, We speak Greek.)

Romanian:
- **(Eu) citesc o carte.** (I am reading a book.)
- **(Noi) vorbim româneşte.** (We speak Romanian.)

Albanian:
- **(Unë) lexoj një libër.** (I am reading a book.)
- **(Ne) flasim shqip.** (We speak Albanian.)

Macedonian:
- **(Јас) читам книга.** ((Jas) čitam kniga, I am reading a book.)
- **(Ние) зборуваме македонски.** ((Nie) zboruvame makedonski, We speak Macedonian.)

### 2. Balkan Conditional

Some Balkan languages have developed a conditional mood using the particle "will" + imperfect:

Bulgarian:
- **щях да чета** (shtyah da cheta, I would read)
- **щяхме да пътуваме** (shtyahme da patuvame, we would travel)

Macedonian:
- **ќе читав** (ḱe čitav, I would read)
- **ќе патувавме** (ḱe patuvavme, we would travel)

Albanian has a similar construction:
- **do të lexoja** (I would read)
- **do të udhëtonim** (we would travel)

### 3. Relativization

Balkan languages often use invariant particles for relativization instead of inflected relative pronouns:

Bulgarian:
- **човекът, който видях** (chovekăt, koyto vidyah, the man whom I saw)
- **книгата, която чета** (knigata, koyato cheta, the book which I'm reading)

Romanian:
- **omul pe care l-am văzut** (the man whom I saw)
- **cartea pe care o citesc** (the book which I'm reading)

Greek:
- **ο άνθρωπος που είδα** (o anthropos pou eida, the man whom I saw)
- **το βιβλίο που διαβάζω** (to vivlio pou diavazo, the book which I'm reading)

Albanian:
- **njeriu që pashë** (the man whom I saw)
- **libri që lexoj** (the book which I'm reading)

Macedonian:
- **човекот што го видов** (čovekot što go vidov, the man whom I saw)
- **книгата што ја читам** (knigata što ja čitam, the book which I'm reading)

### 4. Analytic Dative Construction

Many Balkan languages use a preposition meaning "to" with the accusative case to form the dative, instead of or alongside a synthetic dative case:

Bulgarian:
- **Давам книга на Иван.** (Davam kniga na Ivan, I give a book to Ivan.)

Macedonian:
- **Давам книга на Иван.** (Davam kniga na Ivan, I give a book to Ivan.)

Greek:
- **Δίνω ένα βιβλίο στον Γιάννη.** (Dino ena vivlio ston Gianni, I give a book to Giannis.)

Albanian:
- **I jap një libër Agimit.** (I give a book to Agim.)
- But also: **I jap një libër Agimit.** (using the dative case)

Romanian:
- **Dau o carte lui Ion.** (I give a book to Ion.)
- But also: **Îi dau o carte lui Ion.** (using the dative pronoun)

This feature shows how even in languages that retain case systems, analytical constructions are often preferred or used alongside synthetic ones.
