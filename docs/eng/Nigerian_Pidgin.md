# Nigerian Pidgin

Nigerian Pidgin, also known as Naija or Nigerian Creole English, is an English-based creole language spoken as a lingua franca across Nigeria. It is estimated to be spoken by over 75 million people in Nigeria, either as a primary or secondary language. Nigerian Pidgin evolved from interactions between British sailors and local populations during the colonial era and has since developed into a distinct language with its own grammar and vocabulary.

## Historical Development

The origins of Nigerian Pidgin can be traced back to the 15th century when Portuguese traders first established contact with the Nigerian coast. This early contact led to the development of a Portuguese-based pidgin. However, with the increasing British presence in the 18th and 19th centuries, the pidgin gradually shifted to an English base.

Key stages in the development of Nigerian Pidgin include:

1. 15th-17th centuries: Portuguese-based pidgin develops along the coast
2. 18th-19th centuries: Gradual shift to English-based pidgin due to British colonial presence
3. Late 19th-early 20th century: Pidgin spreads inland with colonial expansion
4. Mid-20th century: Pidgin gains wider usage in urban areas and as an inter-ethnic lingua franca
5. Late 20th-21st century: Increasing recognition and use in media, popular culture, and everyday life

## Phonology

Nigerian Pidgin's phonology is heavily influenced by both English and Nigerian languages, particularly Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa. The exact pronunciation can vary depending on the speaker's linguistic background.

### Vowels

Nigerian Pidgin typically has 7 vowel phonemes:

| Vowel | IPA | Example |
|-------|-----|---------|
| a | /a/ | **haus** [haus] (house) |
| e | /e/ | **get** [get] (have) |
| i | /i/ | **pikin** [pikin] (child) |
| o | /o/ | **sabi** [sabi] (know) |
| ɔ | /ɔ/ | **chɔp** [tʃɔp] (eat) |
| u | /u/ | **put** [put] (put) |
| ə | /ə/ | **dey** [deə] (be) |

Some dialects may have additional vowel sounds, such as:

|-------|-----|---------|
| ɛ | /ɛ/ | **bɛd** [bɛd] (bed) |
| ʊ | /ʊ/ | **bʊk** [bʊk] (book) |

Vowel length is generally not phonemic in Nigerian Pidgin, but some speakers may distinguish between long and short vowels in certain words, especially those borrowed from local languages.

### Consonants

The consonant inventory of Nigerian Pidgin includes:

| Consonant | IPA | Example |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| b | /b/ | **bodi** [bɔdi] (body) |
| d | /d/ | **dey** [de] (be) |
| f | /f/ | **fit** [fit] (can) |

Additional consonant sounds may occur in words borrowed from local languages, such as:

|-----------|-----|---------|
| gb | /gb/ | **gbosa** [gbosa] (praise, applaud) |
| kp | /kp/ | **kpakpa** [kpakpa] (rapidly) |

### Phonological Processes

Several phonological processes are common in Nigerian Pidgin:

1. Final consonant deletion: Word-final consonants, especially plosives, may be deleted.
   Example: **"haus"** [haus] → [hau] (house)

2. Consonant cluster simplification: Complex consonant clusters are often simplified.
   Example: **"strong"** [strɔŋ] → [trɔŋ] or [tɔŋ]

3. Vowel harmonization: Vowels in a word may assimilate to each other, especially in words borrowed from local languages.
   Example: **"wahala"** [wahala] → [wɔhɔlɔ] (trouble)

4. Nasalization: Vowels may be nasalized, especially before nasal consonants.
   Example: **"moni"** [mɔni] → [mɔ̃ni] (money)

### Tone and Intonation

Unlike many Nigerian languages, Nigerian Pidgin is not a tonal language in the strict sense. However, intonation plays a crucial role in conveying meaning and emphasis. Some tonal patterns from local languages may influence the intonation of Nigerian Pidgin, especially in certain idiomatic expressions or borrowed words.

Intonation patterns in Nigerian Pidgin can serve various functions:

1. Distinguishing questions from statements:
   - Statement: **"Yu dey go market."** (You are going to the market.) - falling intonation
   - Question: **"Yu dey go market?"** (Are you going to the market?) - rising intonation

2. Expressing emphasis or contrast:
   - **"NA mi do am"** (I'm the one who did it) - higher pitch on "NA"

3. Conveying emotions or attitudes:
   - **"Abeg!"** (Please!) - can be said with various intonations to express urgency, annoyance, or pleading

### Stress

Stress in Nigerian Pidgin is generally on the first syllable of multisyllabic words, but this can vary depending on the word's origin and the speaker's linguistic background. In compound words or phrases, stress may be used to distinguish meaning:

- **"táya"** (tire) vs. **"tayá"** (be tired)
- **"rédio"** (radio) vs. **"red-áy"** (red eye, meaning to be angry or jealous)

## Orthography

There is no standardized orthography for Nigerian Pidgin, and spelling can vary widely. However, most written forms use the Latin alphabet, often following English spelling conventions with some modifications. Some common spelling practices include:

1. Representing the /ɔ/ sound with "ọ" or simply "o"
2. Using "sh" for /ʃ/ and "ch" for /tʃ/
3. Representing the /ŋ/ sound with "ng" or "ŋ"
4. Using "y" for the /j/ sound at the beginning of words

Examples of spelling variations:

- **"The boy has finished eating"**:
  - **"Di bọi dọn chọp finish"**
  - **"De boy don chop finish"**
  - **"Di boi don chop finish"**

- **"I don't understand"**:
  - **"I no sabi"**
  - **"A noh sabee"**
  - **"I nor sabi"**

Efforts to standardize the orthography of Nigerian Pidgin have been made by various linguists and organizations, but no single system has been universally adopted. Some proposed systems include:

1. Using diacritics to represent open vowels: ẹ, ọ
2. Adopting consistent spelling for common words: **"dey"** (be), **"sabi"** (know)
3. Using apostrophes to indicate elision: **"d'oda"** (the other)

The lack of a standardized orthography reflects the dynamic nature of Nigerian Pidgin and its status as a primarily spoken language. However, as its use in written media increases, there may be growing pressure for standardization.

## Grammar

Nigerian Pidgin grammar shows influences from both English and West African languages, resulting in a unique system that simplifies many aspects of English grammar while incorporating features from local languages.

### Nouns

Nouns in Nigerian Pidgin do not typically change form for number or case. Plurality is often indicated by context or by adding a number or quantifier.

Examples:
- **bọi** (boy/boys): **"Di bọi dey hia"** (The boy is here) / **"Plenti bọi dey hia"** (Many boys are here)
- **haus** (house/houses): **"I get one haus"** (I have a house) / **"I get tu haus"** (I have two houses)

Some nouns may have irregular plural forms, often borrowed from English:
- **man** (man) → **men** (men)
- **wuman** (woman) → **wimen** (women)

Possession is typically indicated by juxtaposition or by using the possessive marker "im":
- **"di man moto"** (the man's car)
- **"di bọi im buk"** (the boy's book)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Nigerian Pidgin do not change form based on case:

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Nigerian Pidgin typically come after the noun they modify, unlike in English:

- **"I no get no moni"** (I don't have any money)

The negative imperative is formed with **"no"**:

### Question formation

Questions are often formed by adding question words or changing intonation:

- **"Yu dey go wia?"** (Where are you going?)

However, the structure can be more flexible than in English, especially in colloquial speech. Topicalization is common, where the topic is fronted:
