# Vietnamese Sentence Patterns

Vietnamese is the national and official language of Vietnam, spoken by around 95 million people in Vietnam and several million more around the world. It is a tonal language belonging to the Austroasiatic language family. Vietnamese is an analytic language, which means it relies on word order and auxiliary words to convey grammatical relationships rather than inflections or declensions.

## Basic Sentence Structure

The basic word order in Vietnamese is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). For example:

**Tôi ăn cơm.**
I eat rice.

**Cô ấy đọc sách.**
She reads book.

**Chúng tôi học tiếng Việt.**
We learn Vietnamese.

While this basic structure is common, Vietnamese word order is relatively flexible compared to English. The emphasis or focus of a sentence can be changed by moving elements around:

**Cơm tôi ăn.** 
Rice I eat. (Emphasizing "rice")

**Đọc sách cô ấy.** 
Read book she. (Emphasizing the action of reading)

**Tiếng Việt chúng tôi học.**
Vietnamese we learn. (Emphasizing "Vietnamese")

This flexibility allows for nuanced expression and can be used to highlight different aspects of the sentence depending on the speaker's intent.

## Pronouns and Names

Vietnamese does not use grammatical gender for pronouns. Instead, pronouns and terms of address depend on the relative age, status, and relationship between speakers. This system is complex and reflects the hierarchical nature of Vietnamese society. Some common pronouns include:

- **tôi** - I/me (neutral)
- **bạn** - you (for peers/friends)
- **anh** - you (to address an older male) / he (to refer to an older male)
- **chị** - you (to address an older female) / she (to refer to an older female)
- **em** - you (to address a younger person) / he/she (to refer to a younger person)
- **nó** - it / he/she (informal, for equals or juniors)
- **chúng tôi** - we (exclusive)
- **chúng ta** - we (inclusive)
- **họ** - they
- **ông** - you (to address an elderly male) / he (to refer to an elderly male)
- **bà** - you (to address an elderly female) / she (to refer to an elderly female)
- **cô** - you (to address a young woman) / she (to refer to a young woman)
- **chú** - you (to address a middle-aged man) / he (to refer to a middle-aged man)

Names and kinship terms are often used in place of pronouns. This practice is deeply ingrained in Vietnamese culture and reflects the importance of social relationships. For example:

**Lan thích ăn phở.**
Lan likes to eat pho.

**Bác sĩ có thể giúp cháu không?**  
Can you (doctor) help me (nephew/niece)?

**Anh Nam đã về nhà chưa?**
Has brother Nam returned home yet?

In these examples, "Lan," "Bác sĩ," and "Anh Nam" are used instead of pronouns, reflecting the speaker's relationship to these individuals.

## Tenses and Aspect

Vietnamese does not use verb conjugations to indicate tense. Instead, time is expressed through context, time expressions, and aspect markers. This makes the language more dependent on context and additional words to convey temporal information. Some common markers include:

- **đã** - indicates completed action
- **đang** - indicates ongoing action  
- **sẽ** - indicates future action
- **từng** - indicates past experience
- **vừa** - indicates recent past
- **sắp** - indicates near future

Examples:

**Tôi ăn cơm.** 
I eat rice. (Simple present or habitual)

**Tôi đã ăn cơm.**
I ate rice. / I have eaten rice.

**Tôi đang ăn cơm.**
I am eating rice.

**Tôi sẽ ăn cơm.**
I will eat rice.

**Tôi từng ăn cơm ở nhà hàng đó.**
I have eaten rice at that restaurant before. (Past experience)

**Tôi vừa ăn cơm xong.**
I have just finished eating rice.

**Tôi sắp ăn cơm.**
I am about to eat rice.

These markers are optional if the time is clear from context:

**Hôm qua tôi ăn phở.**
Yesterday I ate pho.

**Ngày mai tôi ăn phở.**
Tomorrow I eat pho.

**Tuần trước tôi đi Hà Nội.**
Last week I went to Hanoi.

It's important to note that these aspect markers can be combined with time expressions for more precise temporal information:

**Ngày mai tôi sẽ đi Hà Nội.**
Tomorrow I will go to Hanoi.

**Lúc 3 giờ chiều hôm qua, tôi đang học tiếng Việt.**
At 3 PM yesterday, I was studying Vietnamese.

## Negation

The main negation word in Vietnamese is **không**. It is typically placed before the verb or adjective being negated:

**Tôi không thích cà phê.**
I don't like coffee.

**Trời không lạnh.**
The weather is not cold.

**Cô ấy không đi học hôm nay.**
She is not going to school today.

For the past tense, **chưa** (not yet) is often used instead of **không**:

**Tôi chưa ăn cơm.**
I haven't eaten rice yet.

**Anh ấy chưa đến.**
He hasn't arrived yet.

Double negatives are used for emphasis:

**Tôi không biết gì hết.**
I don't know anything at all.

**Nó chẳng làm gì cả.**
He doesn't do anything at all.

Another negation word, **đừng**, is used for negative commands or advice:

**Đừng làm ồn.**
Don't make noise.

**Đừng quên mang ô nhé.**
Don't forget to bring an umbrella.

## Questions

Yes/no questions can be formed by adding question particles like **không** or **chưa** at the end of a statement:

**Bạn thích phở không?**
Do you like pho?

**Bạn đã ăn cơm chưa?**
Have you eaten rice yet?

**Anh có muốn đi xem phim không?**
Do you want to go see a movie?

Wh-questions use question words, which typically come at the end of the sentence:

**Bạn đang làm gì?**
What are you doing?

**Bạn đến từ đâu?**
Where are you from?

**Anh ấy bao nhiêu tuổi?**
How old is he?

Common question words include:

- **gì** - what
- **ai** - who
- **nào** - which
- **bao nhiêu** - how much/many
- **khi nào** - when
- **tại sao** - why
- **như thế nào** - how

Examples:

**Bạn thích món ăn nào nhất?**
Which dish do you like the most?

**Tại sao bạn học tiếng Việt?**
Why are you learning Vietnamese?

**Chúng ta gặp nhau khi nào?**
When will we meet?

In colloquial speech, the question word can sometimes appear at the beginning of the sentence:

**Ai đã nói với bạn?**
Who told you?

## Comparisons

Comparatives are formed using **hơn** (more) after the adjective:

**Tôi cao hơn bạn.**
I am taller than you.

**Phở ngon hơn bún.**
Pho is more delicious than bun.

Superlatives use **nhất** (most) after the adjective:

**Đây là món ăn ngon nhất.**
This is the most delicious dish.

**Cô ấy xinh nhất lớp.**
She is the prettiest in the class.

For equality, **bằng** (as... as) is used:

**Tôi cao bằng bạn.**
I am as tall as you.

**Anh ấy chạy nhanh bằng tôi.**
He runs as fast as I do.

To express "less than," Vietnamese uses **kém... hơn** or **ít... hơn**:

**Tôi kém thông minh hơn bạn.**
I am less intelligent than you.

**Món này ít cay hơn món kia.**
This dish is less spicy than that one.

For comparing quantities, **nhiều hơn** (more than) and **ít hơn** (less than) are used:

**Tôi có nhiều sách hơn bạn.**
I have more books than you.

**Cô ấy ăn ít hơn tôi.**
She eats less than I do.

## Classifiers

Vietnamese uses an extensive system of classifiers, words that must be used with nouns in certain contexts. This system is crucial for correct Vietnamese usage and reflects how objects are categorized in Vietnamese culture. Some common classifiers include:

- **cái** - for inanimate objects
- **con** - for animals and some objects
- **quả** - for round objects
- **cây** - for long objects
- **người** - for people
- **chiếc** - for vehicles and some personal items
- **tờ** - for flat, thin objects like paper
- **cuốn** - for books and notebooks
- **bức** - for paintings, letters, and walls

Examples:

**hai cái bàn** - two tables
**ba con chó** - three dogs
**một quả cam** - one orange
**năm cây bút** - five pens
**bốn người bạn** - four friends
**hai chiếc xe đạp** - two bicycles
**ba tờ giấy** - three sheets of paper
**bốn cuốn sách** - four books
**một bức tranh** - one painting

Classifiers are used with numbers, demonstratives, and in many cases where the noun is being specified:

**Tôi muốn mua cái áo đó.**
I want to buy that shirt.

**Những con mèo này rất dễ thương.**
These cats are very cute.

**Mỗi người một cuốn sách.**
One book for each person.

It's important to note that some nouns can take different classifiers depending on the context or the speaker's perspective:

**một cái nhà** / **một căn nhà** - a house
**một con dao** / **một cái dao** - a knife

## Sentence-Final Particles

Vietnamese uses a variety of sentence-final particles to express mood, attitude, or emphasis. These particles add nuance and emotion to statements and are crucial for natural-sounding Vietnamese. Some common ones include:

- **nhé** - friendly suggestion or mild command
- **nha** - seeking agreement or emphasizing a statement
- **đấy/đó** - drawing attention or mild warning
- **mà** - contradiction or emphasis
- **ạ** - politeness marker
- **nhỉ** - seeking confirmation or agreement
- **chứ** - emphasis or rhetorical question
- **à** - mild surprise or realization

Examples:

**Đi ăn phở nhé.**
Let's go eat pho.

**Tôi đi làm đây.**
I'm going to work now.

**Cẩn thận đấy.**
Be careful.

**Tôi nói rồi mà.**
I already told you.

**Cảm ơn thầy ạ.**
Thank you, teacher. (polite)

**Đẹp quá nhỉ?**
It's beautiful, isn't it?

**Bạn thích phở chứ?**
You like pho, don't you?

**Ồ, bạn đến rồi à?**
Oh, you've arrived?

These particles can significantly change the tone and meaning of a sentence, and their proper use is essential for conveying the right attitude in Vietnamese conversation.

## Modals and Auxiliaries

Vietnamese uses several modal verbs and auxiliaries to express ability, permission, obligation, etc. These words help to modify the main verb and add layers of meaning to the sentence. Some common ones include:

- **có thể** - can, may, might
- **được** - can, may, be allowed to
- **phải** - must, have to
- **nên** - should
- **muốn** - want to
- **cần** - need to
- **nên** - should
- **không nên** - shouldn't
- **có lẽ** - perhaps, maybe

Examples:

**Tôi có thể nói tiếng Việt.**
I can speak Vietnamese.

**Bạn được vào đây.**
You are allowed to enter here.

**Chúng ta phải đi bây giờ.**
We must go now.

**Bạn nên học tiếng Việt.**
You should learn Vietnamese.

**Tôi muốn ăn phở.**
I want to eat pho.

**Chúng ta cần mua thêm gạo.**
We need to buy more rice.

**Bạn không nên hút thuốc.**
You shouldn't smoke.

**Có lẽ trời sẽ mưa.**
Perhaps it will rain.

These modals and auxiliaries can be combined with negation and aspect markers for more complex expressions:

**Tôi không thể đi được.**
I cannot go.

**Bạn không nên làm như vậy.**
You shouldn't do that.

**Chúng ta sẽ phải học nhiều hơn.**
We will have to study more.

## Passive Voice

Vietnamese doesn't have a true passive voice like English. Instead, it uses several constructions to express passive meaning:

1. Using **được** (to be fortunate):

**Quyển sách được viết bởi ai?**
By whom was the book written? (Literally: The book was fortunate to be written by whom?)

**Bức tranh này được vẽ năm ngoái.**
This painting was painted last year.

2. Using **bị** (to suffer, for negative situations):

**Cái cửa sổ bị vỡ.**
The window was broken.

**Cô ấy bị đuổi việc.**
She was fired from her job.

3. Using the main verb without a subject:

**Người ta nói tiếng Việt ở Việt Nam.**
Vietnamese is spoken in Vietnam. (Literally: People speak Vietnamese in Vietnam.)

**Bánh mì bán ở đây.**
Banh mi is sold here. (Literally: (Someone) sells banh mi here.)

4. Using **có** (to have):

**Có nhiều người bị thương trong tai nạn.**
Many people were injured in the accident. (Literally: There were many people suffering injuries in the accident.)

The choice between these constructions depends on the context and the speaker's intention. **Được** is used for positive or neutral situations, while **bị** is used for negative ones. The subjectless construction is more neutral and impersonal.

## Serial Verb Constructions

Vietnamese frequently uses serial verb constructions, where two or more verbs or verb phrases occur in sequence without any coordinating conjunction. This allows for complex actions to be described in a single clause:

**Tôi đi mua bánh mì.**
I go buy bread. (I'm going to buy bread.)

**Cô ấy về nhà nấu cơm.**
She returns home cooks rice. (She's going home to cook rice.)

**Anh ấy chạy lên cầu thang.**
He runs up stairs. (He runs up the stairs.)

**Chúng tôi ngồi nói chuyện cả đêm.**
We sit talk whole night. (We sat talking all night.)

These constructions are very common in Vietnamese and allow for efficient expression of complex actions or sequences of events. They can involve more than two verbs:

**Tôi đi chợ mua rau về nấu canh.**
I go market buy vegetables return cook soup. (I'm going to the market to buy vegetables and come back to cook soup.)

## Topic-Comment Structure

Vietnamese often uses a topic-comment structure, where the topic of the sentence is introduced first, followed by a comment about it. This structure is used to emphasize or introduce a new topic:

**Phở thì tôi thích ăn.**
As for pho, I like to eat (it).

**Sách này thì hay.**
This book, (it) is interesting.

**Hà Nội ấy mà, đẹp lắm.**
Hanoi, you know, (it's) very beautiful.

This structure is particularly useful for contrasting or comparing:

**Cà phê thì tôi thích, nhưng trà thì không.**
As for coffee, I like it, but tea, I don't.

## Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences in Vietnamese often use **nếu** (if) to introduce the condition:

**Nếu trời mưa, tôi sẽ ở nhà.**
If it rains, I will stay at home.

**Nếu có tiền, tôi sẽ mua xe.**
If I have money, I will buy a car.

For counterfactual conditions, **giá mà** (if only) or **giả sử** (suppose that) can be used:

**Giá mà tôi biết sớm hơn.**
If only I had known earlier.

**Giả sử tôi là bạn, tôi sẽ không làm vậy.**
Suppose I were you, I wouldn't do that.

Vietnamese also uses **nếu... thì...** structure for more emphatic conditionals:

**Nếu trời mưa thì chúng ta sẽ hủy chuyến đi.**
If it rains, then we will cancel the trip.

## Imperative Sentences

Imperative sentences in Vietnamese can be formed simply by using the verb without a subject:

**Đi nhanh lên!**
Go faster!

**Đừng làm ồn.**
Don't make noise.

For polite requests, **xin** (please) or **làm ơn** (do a favor) can be added:

**Xin vui lòng đợi một chút.**
Please wait a moment.

**Làm ơn giúp tôi.**
Please help me.

Imperatives can also be softened by adding particles like **nhé** or **nha**:

**Nhớ gọi cho tôi nhé.**
Remember to call me, okay?

**Cẩn thận nha.**
Be careful, alright?

## Expressing Possession

Possession in Vietnamese is typically expressed using the structure "possessed + của + possessor":

**Đây là quyển sách của tôi.**
This is my book. (Literally: This is book of me.)

**Chiếc xe đạp của anh ấy màu xanh.**
His bicycle is blue. (Literally: The bicycle of him is blue.)

For inalienable possession (like body parts or family members), **của** is often omitted:

**Tay tôi đau.**
My hand hurts. (Literally: Hand I hurts.)

**Mẹ tôi là giáo viên.**
My mother is a teacher. (Literally: Mother I is teacher.)

Possession can also be expressed using **có** (to have):

She has two older brothers.

## Expressing Existence

To express existence, Vietnamese uses **có** (to have):

For negative existence, **không có** is used:

There is nobody here. (Literally: Here not have anybody.)

**Trong tủ lạnh không có gì để ăn.**
There's nothing to eat in the fridge. (Literally: In refrigerator not have anything to eat.)

## Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Vietnamese typically follow the noun they modify and are introduced by **mà**:

**Người mà tôi gặp hôm qua là bác sĩ.**
The person whom I met yesterday is a doctor.

**Quyển sách mà tôi đang đọc rất hay.**
The book that I am reading is very interesting.

However, **mà** can often be omitted, especially in spoken Vietnamese:

**Quyển sách tôi đang đọc rất hay.**
The book (that) I am reading is very interesting.

**Cô gái anh ấy yêu là bạn tôi.**
The girl (whom) he loves is my friend.

In some cases, especially with time or place expressions, **khi** (when) or **nơi** (where) can be used instead of **mà**:

## Time Expressions

Time expressions in Vietnamese typically come at the beginning or end of a sentence:

## Sentence Connectors

Vietnamese uses various sentence connectors to link ideas and improve the flow of discourse:

- **trước tiên** - first of all
- **sau đó** - after that
- **cuối cùng** - finally
- **mặt khác** - on the other hand
- **tuy nhiên** - however
- **ngoài ra** - besides, moreover

## Idiomatic Expressions

Vietnamese has many idiomatic expressions that may not translate directly. Understanding these is crucial for advanced language proficiency. Some examples:

Understanding these patterns and structures will help learners construct a wide variety of sentences in Vietnamese. However, as with any language, practice and exposure to native speakers are key to mastering these patterns and using them naturally in conversation.

It's important to note that while these patterns provide a solid foundation for understanding Vietnamese sentence structure, the language is rich and complex, with many regional variations and colloquial expressions. Continuous learning and immersion in Vietnamese culture and language will help learners to refine their understanding and usage of these patterns.
