# Latvian

Latvian (latvie**š**u valoda) is a Baltic language spoken primarily in Latvia by about 1.5 million native speakers. It is closely related to Lithuanian, and more distantly to the extinct Old Prussian. Latvian is the official language of Latvia and one of the official languages of the European Union.

## Alphabet and Pronunciation

The Latvian alphabet consists of 33 letters:

|-----------|---------|---------|
| ai | **maize** | bread |
| au | **auksts** | cold |

### Syllable Intonation

Latvian has a tonal accent system with three types of syllable intonations in stressed syllables:

1. Level (stieptā intonācija)
2. Falling (krītošā intonācija)
3. Broken (lauztā intonācija)

These intonations can distinguish meaning in some words:

- **zāle** [zɑːle] (with level intonation) - grass
- **zāle** [zâːle] (with falling intonation) - hall

## Morphology

### Nouns

Latvian nouns have two grammatical genders (masculine and feminine), two numbers (singular and plural), and seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative, vocative).

#### Declension Patterns

Comparative and superlative forms:

- Comparative: add -āk

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Latvian is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), but due to its case system, word order can be flexible for emphasis or stylistic reasons.

- **Es lasu grāmatu.** (I read a book.) - neutral order
- **Grāmatu es lasu.** (It's a book that I'm reading.) - emphasis on the object

### Negation

Negation is formed by adding the prefix **ne-** to verbs and the word **ne** before other parts of speech:

- **Es nelasu grāmatu.** (I don't read a book.)
- **Tā nav grāmata.** (That is not a book.)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by intonation or by using the particle **vai** at the beginning of the sentence:

- **Vai tu runā latviski?** (Do you speak Latvian?)

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns or adverbs:

- **Kas** tas ir? (What is that?)
- **Kur** tu dzīvo? (Where do you live?)

### Compound Sentences

Coordinating conjunctions:

- **un** (and)
- **bet** (but)

Example: **Es mācos latviešu valodu, bet mans brālis mācās angļu valodu.** (I study Latvian, but my brother studies English.)

### Complex Sentences

Subordinating conjunctions:

- **ka** (that)
- **jo** (because)
- **lai** (in order to)

Example: **Es zinu, ka viņš runā latviski.** (I know that he speaks Latvian.)

## Vocabulary

Latvian vocabulary has been influenced by various languages throughout its history:

1. German: due to historical dominance
   Example: **būvēt** (to build) from German "bauen"

2. Russian: due to Soviet occupation
   Example: **čemodāns** (suitcase) from Russian "чемодан"

3. English: modern loanwords, especially in technology
   Example: **dators** (computer)

4. Finnish: some loanwords due to geographical proximity
   Example: **puisis** (boy) from Finnish "poika"

Many words share roots with other Baltic and Slavic languages:

- Latvian **māte**, Lithuanian **motina**, Russian **мать** (mother)

### Word Formation

Latvian frequently uses prefixes and suffixes to form new words:

- **iet** (to go) → **aiziet** (to leave), **ieiet** (to enter)
- **darbs** (work) → **darbinieks** (worker), **darbnīca** (workshop)

### Idiomatic Expressions

Latvian has many idiomatic expressions:

- **Likt aiz auss** (lit. "to put behind the ear") - to remember something important
- **Ne auss, ne aste** (lit. "neither ear nor tail") - neither fish nor fowl

## Dialects

Latvian has three main dialect groups:

1. Livonian dialect (lībiskais dialekts)
2. Middle dialect (vidus dialekts)
3. High Latvian dialect (augšzemnieku dialekts)

The standard Latvian language is based primarily on the Middle dialect.

## Colloquial Latvian

Colloquial Latvian often differs from the standard written language:

- Shortened forms: **nezinu** instead of **nezinu** (I don't know)
- Slang: **foršs** (cool) instead of **labs** (good)
- Russian loanwords: **čau** (bye) from Russian "чао"

## Phonological Processes

### Palatalization

Consonants can be palatalized before front vowels:

- **ķ** [c] is the palatalized version of **k** [k]
- **ģ** [ɟ] is the palatalized version of **g** [g]
- **ļ** [ʎ] is the palatalized version of **l** [l]
- **ņ** [ɲ] is the palatalized version of **n** [n]

Example: **kaķis** [kacis] (cat)

### Voicing Assimilation

In Latvian, voicing assimilation occurs when voiced and voiceless consonants come into contact:

- **labs draugs** [labz draugs] (good friend)
- **apgāds** [abgāds] (publisher)

### Vowel Harmony

While not as extensive as in some languages, Latvian exhibits a form of vowel harmony in certain word-formation processes:

- **zāle** (grass) → **zālīte** (diminutive, little grass)
- **māja** (house) → **mājiņa** (diminutive, little house)

## Syntax

### Impersonal Constructions

Latvian uses impersonal constructions to express various states or actions without a specific subject:

- **Līst.** (It's raining.)
- **Man salst.** (I'm cold, literally "To me it's freezing.")

### Reflexive Verbs

Reflexive verbs are formed by adding the suffix **-ties** to the infinitive:

- **mazgāt** (to wash) → **mazgāties** (to wash oneself)
- **ģērbt** (to dress) → **ģērbties** (to dress oneself)

Example: **Es mazgājos no rīta.** (I wash myself in the morning.)

### Passive Voice

The passive voice is formed using the auxiliary verb **tikt** (to get) and the past passive participle:

- **Grāmata tiek lasīta.** (The book is being read.)
- **Māja tika uzcelta pagājušajā gadā.** (The house was built last year.)

### Aspect

While not as developed as in Slavic languages, Latvian does have some aspectual distinctions:

- Imperfective: **lasīt** (to read, general action)
- Perfective: **izlasīt** (to read through, completed action)

Example: 
- **Es lasu grāmatu.** (I'm reading a book.)
- **Es izlasīju grāmatu.** (I finished reading the book.)

Numbers from 11 to 19 are formed by adding **-padsmit** to the root:
- 11 - **vienpadsmit**
- 12 - **divpadsmit**

### Ordinal Numbers

Formed by adding the ending **-ais** (m) or **-ā** (f) to the cardinal number:

- 2nd - **otrais** (m), **otrā** (f)
- 3rd - **trešais** (m), **trešā** (f)

### Usage with Nouns

After numbers 1, 21, 31, etc., nouns are in the nominative singular:
- **viens koks** (one tree)

After numbers 2-9, nouns are in the nominative plural:
- **pieci koki** (five trees)

After numbers 10 and above, nouns are in the genitive plural:
- **desmit koku** (ten trees)

## Particles and Interjections

Latvian has various particles that add nuance to sentences:

- **jā** (yes)
- **nē** (no)

- Formal: **Kā jums iet?** (How are you doing?)
- Informal: **Kā tev iet?** (How are you doing?)

### Discourse Markers

Latvian uses various discourse markers to structure conversation:

- **nu** (well)
- **tātad** (so, therefore)
- **proti** (namely)

Example: **Nu, tātad, ko mēs tagad darīsim?** (Well, so, what shall we do now?)

## Phraseology

Latvian has many idiomatic phrases and proverbs:

- **Dot zaļo gaismu** (To give the green light) - to approve
- **Kas lēti nāk, tas dārgi maksā** (What comes cheap, costs dearly) - similar to "You get what you pay for"

## Writing System

Latvian uses the Latin alphabet with additional diacritical marks. The alphabet order is important for dictionary lookup and filing systems.

### Capitalization Rules

- Sentence beginnings
- Proper nouns
- Nationalities and languages
- Holidays and special days
- First word in book titles (unlike English, subsequent words are not capitalized unless they are proper nouns)

Example: **Ziemassvētki Latvijā** (Christmas in Latvia)

### Punctuation

Latvian punctuation is similar to other European languages, with some specifics:

- Quotation marks: „quoted text" (lower-bottom and upper-top)
- Decimal comma instead of point: 3,14 (pi)

## Sociolinguistics

Latvian is the official language of Latvia and one of the official languages of the European Union. There's a strong emphasis on language preservation and development due to historical periods of suppression and the current demographic situation.

The State Language Center (Valsts valodas centrs) is responsible for implementing state language policy, including terminology development and language standardization.

## Language Contact

Latvian has been influenced by and has influenced neighboring languages:

- Livonian (nearly extinct Finno-Ugric language) has left traces in Latvian phonology and vocabulary
- Lithuanian shares many similarities due to their common Baltic origin
- Russian has had a significant impact due to historical and demographic factors
- German has contributed many loanwords, especially in urban areas
