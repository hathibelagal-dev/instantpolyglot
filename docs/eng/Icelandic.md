# Icelandic

Icelandic is a North Germanic language spoken by about 360,000 people, primarily in Iceland. It is closely related to Faroese and Western Norwegian dialects, and more distantly to other Scandinavian languages. Icelandic is known for its conservative nature, having changed relatively little since the medieval period, which allows modern Icelanders to read Old Norse sagas with relative ease.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Icelandic pronunciation is relatively consistent, with each letter generally corresponding to a specific sound. However, there are some complexities, particularly with vowel length and the pronunciation of certain consonant combinations.

### Vowels

Icelandic has both short and long vowels. Vowel length is phonemic, meaning it can change the meaning of words. Long vowels are typically marked with an acute accent (´).

| Letter | Short sound | Long sound |
|--------|-------------|------------|
**a** | [a] | **á** [au]
**e** | [ɛ] | **é** [jɛ]
**i, y** | [ɪ] | **í, ý** [i]
**o** | [ɔ] | **ó** [ou]
**u** | [ʏ] | **ú** [u]
**ö** | [œ] | **ö** [œ:]

Examples:
- **satt** [saht] (true, neuter) vs. **sátt** [sauht] (reconciled, neuter)
- **her** [hɛr] (army) vs. **hér** [hjɛr] (here)
- **vita** [vɪ:ta] (to know) vs. **víta** [vi:ta] (to blame)

### Consonants

Most consonants are pronounced similarly to English, with some notable exceptions:

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
**þ** | [θ] (like 'th' in "think")
**ð** | [ð] (like 'th' in "this")
**hv** | [kv] or [xv]
**ll** | [tl]
**rl** | [rtl]
**rn** | [rtn]

Examples:
- **þak** [θa:k] (roof)
- **eða** [ɛ:ða] (or)
- **hvað** [kva:ð] or [xva:ð] (what)
- **fall** [fatl] (fall)
- **karl** [kartl] (man)
- **barn** [partn] (child)

### Stress

The stress in Icelandic words is almost always on the first syllable: **bílinn** [ˈbi:lɪn] (the car), **tölva** [ˈtœlva] (computer).

## Morphology

Icelandic has a complex system of inflection, with nouns, adjectives, and verbs all undergoing significant changes to indicate grammatical function.

### Nouns

Icelandic nouns have three gender classes: masculine, feminine, and neuter. They are declined in four cases (nominative, accusative, dative, genitive) and two numbers (singular and plural). There are several declension patterns, often with internal vowel changes.

Here's an example of a strong masculine noun declension:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **hestur** (horse) | **hestar** |
| Accusative | **hest** | **hesta** |
| Dative | **hesti** | **hestum** |
| Genitive | **hests** | **hesta** |

And a weak feminine noun:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **tunga** (tongue) | **tungur** |
| Accusative | **tungu** | **tungur** |
| Dative | **tungu** | **tungum** |
| Genitive | **tungu** | **tungna** |

Neuter example:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **land** (land) | **lönd** |
| Accusative | **land** | **lönd** |
| Dative | **landi** | **löndum** |
| Genitive | **lands** | **landa** |

Note the internal vowel change in the plural forms of **land**.

### Definite Article

Icelandic doesn't have a separate definite article like "the" in English. Instead, it uses a suffix attached to the noun. This suffix also declines for case, number, and gender:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **hestur**inn (the horse) | **hestar**nir |
| Accusative | **hest**inn | **hesta**na |
| Dative | **hesti**num | **hestu**num |
| Genitive | **hests**ins | **hesta**nna |

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Icelandic agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case. They also have strong and weak declensions. The weak declension is used when the adjective is preceded by the definite article or demonstratives.

Strong declension of **góður** (good):

| Case | Masc. Sing. | Fem. Sing. | Neut. Sing. | Plural |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Nominative | **góður** | **góð** | **gott** | **góðir** / **góðar** / **góð** |
| Accusative | **góðan** | **góða** | **gott** | **góða** / **góðar** / **góð** |
| Dative | **góðum** | **góðri** | **góðu** | **góðum** |
| Genitive | **góðs** | **góðrar** | **góðs** | **góðra** |

Weak declension of **góði** (the good):

| Case | Masc. Sing. | Fem. Sing. | Neut. Sing. | Plural |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Nominative | **góði** | **góða** | **góða** | **góðu** |
| Accusative | **góða** | **góðu** | **góða** | **góðu** |
| Dative | **góða** | **góðu** | **góða** | **góðu** |
| Genitive | **góða** | **góðu** | **góða** | **góðu** |

Examples:
- **Góður maður** (a good man)
- **Góði maðurinn** (the good man)
- **Góð kona** (a good woman)
- **Góða konan** (the good woman)
- **Gott barn** (a good child)
- **Góða barnið** (the good child)

### Pronouns

Icelandic pronouns are declined for case. Here are the personal pronouns:

| Case | 1st sg. | 2nd sg. | 3rd sg. masc. | 3rd sg. fem. | 3rd sg. neut. | 1st pl. | 2nd pl. | 3rd pl. |
|------|---------|---------|---------------|--------------|---------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Nominative | **ég** | **þú** | **hann** | **hún** | **það** | **við** | **þið** | **þau** |
| Accusative | **mig** | **þig** | **hann** | **hana** | **það** | **okkur** | **ykkur** | **þau** |
| Dative | **mér** | **þér** | **honum** | **henni** | **því** | **okkur** | **ykkur** | **þeim** |
| Genitive | **mín** | **þín** | **hans** | **hennar** | **þess** | **okkar** | **ykkar** | **þeirra** |

Demonstrative pronouns also decline. Here's the declension for **þessi** (this):

| Case | Masc. Sing. | Fem. Sing. | Neut. Sing. | Plural |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Nominative | **þessi** | **þessi** | **þetta** | **þessir** / **þessar** / **þessi** |
| Accusative | **þennan** | **þessa** | **þetta** | **þessa** / **þessar** / **þessi** |
| Dative | **þessum** | **þessari** | **þessu** | **þessum** |
| Genitive | **þessa** | **þessarar** | **þessa** | **þessara** |

## Numbers

Cardinal numbers in Icelandic are:

1 - **einn** (m.) / **ein** (f.) / **eitt** (n.)
2 - **tveir** (m.) / **tvær** (f.) / **tvö** (n.)
3 - **þrír** (m.) / **þrjár** (f.) / **þrjú** (n.)
4 - **fjórir** (m.) / **fjórar** (f.) / **fjögur** (n.)
5 - **fimm**
6 - **sex**
7 - **sjö**
8 - **átta**
9 - **níu**
10 - **tíu**

Numbers 1-4 decline for gender and case. For example, **tveir** (two) declines as follows:

| Case | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **tveir** | **tvær** | **tvö** |
| Accusative | **tvo** | **tvær** | **tvö** |
| Dative | **tveimur** | **tveimur** | **tveimur** |
| Genitive | **tveggja** | **tveggja** | **tveggja** |

Ordinal numbers also exist and decline like adjectives:

1st - **fyrsti** (m.) / **fyrsta** (f.) / **fyrsta** (n.)
2nd - **annar** (m.) / **önnur** (f.) / **annað** (n.)
3rd - **þriðji** (m.) / **þriðja** (f.) / **þriðja** (n.)
4th - **fjórði** (m.) / **fjórða** (f.) / **fjórða** (n.)

## Verbs

Icelandic verbs are conjugated for person (1st, 2nd, 3rd), number (singular, plural), tense (present, past), mood (indicative, subjunctive, imperative), and voice (active, middle). There are strong verbs (with vowel changes) and weak verbs (with suffixes).

### Present Tense

Here's the present tense conjugation of the weak verb **að tala** (to speak):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **tala** | **tölum** |
| 2nd | **talar** | **talið** |
| 3rd | **talar** | **tala** |

And for the strong verb **að fara** (to go):

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **fer** | **förum** |
| 2nd | **ferð** | **farið** |
| 3rd | **fer** | **fara** |

### Past Tense

The past tense of **að tala**:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **talaði** | **töluðum** |
| 2nd | **talaðir** | **töluðuð** |
| 3rd | **talaði** | **töluðu** |

And for **að fara**:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **fór** | **fórum** |
| 2nd | **fórst** | **fóruð** |
| 3rd | **fór** | **fóru** |

### Subjunctive Mood

Icelandic maintains a distinct subjunctive mood, used for hypothetical or unreal situations. Here's the present subjunctive of **að tala**:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **tali** | **tölum** |
| 2nd | **talir** | **talið** |

| 1st | **talaði** | **töluðum** |
| 2nd | **talaðir** | **töluðuð** |
| 3rd | **talaði** | **töluðu** |

### Middle Voice

Icelandic has a middle voice, which often indicates reflexive or reciprocal action. It's formed by adding **-st** to the active form:

- **að klæða** (to dress) → **að klæðast** (to dress oneself)
- **að kyssa** (to kiss) → **að kyssast** (to kiss each other)

### Imperative

The imperative is formed from the stem of the verb:

- **tala!** (speak!)
- **farðu!** (go!) - note the suffixed pronoun

### Participles

Icelandic has present and past participles:

- Present participle of **að tala**: **talandi** (speaking)
- Past participle of **að tala**: **talað** (spoken)

### Irregular Verbs

Some common verbs are irregular, such as **að vera** (to be):

Present tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **er** | **erum** |
| 2nd | **ert** | **eruð** |
| 3rd | **er** | **eru** |

Past tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **var** | **vorum** |
| 2nd | **varst** | **voruð** |
| 3rd | **var** | **voru** |

## Syntax

Icelandic typically follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, but due to its case system, word order can be quite flexible, especially for emphasis or in poetry.

### Basic Sentence Structure

A simple Icelandic sentence follows this pattern:

**Ég les bókina.** (I read the book.)

Here, **Ég** (I) is the subject, **les** (read) is the verb, and **bókina** (the book) is the object.

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by inverting the subject and verb:

- Statement: **Þú talar íslensku.** (You speak Icelandic.)
- Question: **Talar þú íslensku?** (Do you speak Icelandic?)

Wh-questions use question words like **hver** (who), **hvað** (what), **hvar** (where), **hvenær** (when), **af hverju** (why):

**Hver er þetta?** (Who is this?)
**Hvað gerðir þú í gær?** (What did you do yesterday?)

### Negation

Negation is formed by placing the adverb **ekki** (not) after the verb:

**Ég tala ekki íslensku.** (I do not speak Icelandic.)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by the relative pronoun **sem**:

**Maðurinn sem ég sá í gær er hér.** (The man whom I saw yesterday is here.)

### Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences often use the subjunctive mood:

**Ef ég væri ríkur, myndi ég ferðast um heiminn.** (If I were rich, I would travel the world.)

### Word Order in Subordinate Clauses

In subordinate clauses, the word order often changes, with the verb coming at the end:

**Ég veit að þú íslensku talar.** (I know that you speak Icelandic.)

### Impersonal Constructions

Icelandic often uses impersonal constructions, particularly with weather or feelings:

**Það rignir.** (It's raining.) - Literally: "It rains."
**Mig langar í kaffi.** (I want coffee.) - Literally: "Me longs for coffee."

## Case Usage

The four cases in Icelandic (nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive) are used in various contexts:

### Nominative Case

Used for:
- The subject of a sentence: **Hundurinn** beit manninn. (The dog bit the man.)
- Predicate nominatives: Hún er **kennari**. (She is a teacher.)

### Accusative Case

Used for:
- Direct objects: Ég sá **hundinn**. (I saw the dog.)
- After certain prepositions: Við förum um **borgina**. (We go around the city.)
- To express duration of time: Ég beið í **klukkustund**. (I waited for an hour.)

### Dative Case

Used for:
- Indirect objects: Ég gaf **hundinum** mat. (I gave the dog food.)
- After certain prepositions: Ég fer frá **húsinu**. (I go from the house.)
- With certain verbs: Ég hjálpa **þér**. (I help you.)

### Genitive Case

Used for:
- Possession: Þetta er bók **Jóns**. (This is John's book.)
- After certain prepositions: Til **borgarinnar**. (To the city.)
- Partitive expressions: Hluti **hópsins**. (Part of the group.)

## Prepositions

Icelandic prepositions govern different cases. Some prepositions can govern multiple cases, with the meaning changing slightly. Here are some common prepositions:

- **í** (in, into): 
  With dative (static location): **Ég er í húsinu.** (I am in the house.)
  With accusative (motion): **Ég fer í húsið.** (I go into the house.)

- **á** (on, onto):
  With dative (static location): **Bókin er á borðinu.** (The book is on the table.)
  With accusative (motion): **Ég set bókina á borðið.** (I put the book onto the table.)

- **með** (with):
  With dative: **Ég fer með vini mínum.** (I go with my friend.)
  With accusative: **Ég tek með mér bókina.** (I take the book with me.)

- **til** (to, towards): Always with genitive
  **Ég fer til Íslands.** (I go to Iceland.)

- **frá** (from): Always with dative
  **Ég kom frá skólanum.** (I came from the school.)

## Particles and Adverbs

Icelandic has a rich system of particles and adverbs that can significantly modify the meaning of sentences:

- **bara** (just, only): **Ég er bara að spjalla.** (I'm just chatting.)
- **nú** (now): **Nú skil ég.** (Now I understand.)
- **samt** (still, nevertheless): **Ég fer samt.** (I'm going anyway.)
- **alveg** (completely, quite): **Þetta er alveg rétt.** (This is completely correct.)
- **eiginlega** (actually, really): **Ég er eiginlega búinn.** (I'm actually finished.)

## Word Formation

Icelandic is known for its tendency to create new words from existing roots rather than borrowing foreign words. This process often involves compounding:

- **sjúkrahús** (hospital) = **sjúkur** (sick) + **hús** (house)
- **tölvupóstur** (email) = **tölva** (computer) + **póstur** (mail)
- **snjallsími** (smartphone) = **snjall** (smart) + **sími** (phone)

Suffixes are also used to create new words:

- **-legur** (adjective suffix): **vináttulegur** (friendly) from **vinátta** (friendship)
- **-un** (noun suffix for action): **þýðing** (translation) from **að þýða** (to translate)

## Vocabulary

Icelandic vocabulary has remained relatively stable over the centuries, with many words traceable back to Old Norse. However, new words have been coined to describe modern concepts:

1. Technology:
   - **tölva** (computer) - coined from **tala** (number) and **völva** (prophetess)
   - **forrit** (program) - from **for-** (pre-) and **rita** (to write)

2. Science:
   - **efnafræði** (chemistry) - from **efni** (substance) and **fræði** (study)
   - **líffræði** (biology) - from **líf** (life) and **fræði** (study)

3. Modern life:
   - **sjónvarp** (television) - from **sjón** (sight) and **varp** (projection)
   - **flugvél** (airplane) - from **flug** (flight) and **vél** (machine)

4. Food and drink:
   - **bjór** (beer) - an old Norse word
   - **kaffi** (coffee) - a rare example of a loanword

5. Nature:
   - **jökull** (glacier) - an old Norse word
   - **eldfjall** (volcano) - from **eldur** (fire) and **fjall** (mountain)

While Icelandic does have some loanwords, especially for international concepts, it generally prefers to create new words from Icelandic roots.

## Idioms and Expressions

Icelandic has many colorful idioms and expressions:

- **Þetta reddast** - "It will all work out okay" (literally: "It will sort itself out")
- **Að kasta mæðinni** - "To catch one's breath" (literally: "To throw away the exhaustion")
- **Að standa á gati** - "To be surprised" (literally: "To stand on a hole")
- **Að vera með annan fótinn í gröfinni** - "To be close to death" (literally: "To have one foot in the grave")
- **Að taka því með stóískri ró** - "To take it calmly" (literally: "To take it with stoic calm")

## Phonological Processes

Icelandic undergoes several phonological processes that affect pronunciation:

1. U-umlaut: When a **u** or **v** follows in the next syllable, **a** changes to **ö**:
   - **dagur** (day) → **dögum** (days, dative plural)

2. I-umlaut: This is a historical process that still affects modern forms. It changed **a** to **e**, **á** to **æ**, **o** to **y**, **ó** to **æ**, **u** to **y**, **ú** to **ý**, **jó** to **ý**, **jú** to **ý**:
   - **fótur** (foot) → **fætur** (feet)

3. Consonant assimilation: When certain consonants come together, one may change to become more like the other:
   - **vinur** (friend) + **-legur** → **vinsamlegur** (friendly)

4. Aspiration loss: **p**, **t**, **k** lose their aspiration after **s**:
   - **steinn** [steitn̥] (stone)

## Writing System

Icelandic uses the Latin alphabet with some additional characters:

- **Ð** ð (eth): Represents the voiced dental fricative [ð]
- **Þ** þ (thorn): Represents the voiceless dental fricative [θ]
- **Æ** æ: Represents the diphthong [ai]
- **Ö** ö: Represents the vowel [œ]

Accented vowels (**á**, **é**, **í**, **ó**, **ú**, **ý**) are considered separate letters and come after their unaccented counterparts in alphabetical order.
