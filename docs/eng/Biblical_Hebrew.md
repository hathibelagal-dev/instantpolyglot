# Biblical Hebrew

Biblical Hebrew, also known as Classical Hebrew, is the ancient form of Hebrew used in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh). It was spoken in ancient Israel from around 1200 BCE to 400 BCE. Biblical Hebrew is distinct from Modern Hebrew, though the latter draws heavily from it.

## Writing System

Biblical Hebrew is written using the Hebrew alphabet, which consists of 22 consonant letters. Vowels are typically not written in the original texts, though later systems of vowel notation were developed.

### Consonants

The Hebrew alphabet:

| Letter | Name | Transliteration | IPA |
|--------|------|-----------------|-----|
| א | Alef | ' | [ʔ] |
| ב | Bet | b, v | [b], [v] |
| ג | Gimel | g | [ɡ] |
| ד | Dalet | d | [d] |
| ה | He | h | [h] |
| ו | Vav | v, w | [v], [w] |
| ז | Zayin | z | [z] |
| ח | Het | ḥ | [ħ] |
| ט | Tet | ṭ | [tˤ] |
| י | Yod | y | [j] |
| כ ך | Kaf | k, kh | [k], [x] |
| ל | Lamed | l | [l] |
| מ ם | Mem | m | [m] |
| נ ן | Nun | n | [n] |
| ס | Samekh | s | [s] |
| ע | Ayin | ' | [ʕ] |
| פ ף | Pe | p, f | [p], [f] |
| צ ץ | Tsadi | ṣ | [sˤ] |
| ק | Qof | q | [q] |
| ר | Resh | r | [r] |
| שׂ | Sin | ś | [s] |
| שׁ | Shin | š | [ʃ] |
| ת | Tav | t | [t] |

Note: Some letters have a different form when they appear at the end of a word (final form). These are כ ך, מ ם, נ ן, פ ף, and צ ץ.

### Vowels

In the original Biblical texts, vowels were not written. Later, two systems were developed to indicate vowels:

1. Niqqud: A system of dots and dashes placed above, below, or inside the consonant letters.
2. Matres lectionis: The use of certain consonant letters (א, ה, ו, י) to indicate vowels.

The Niqqud system:

| Name | Symbol | IPA |
|------|--------|-----|
| Patach | ַ | [a] |
| Qamatz | ָ | [ɔ] or [a] |
| Segol | ֶ | [ɛ] |
| Tzere | ֵ | [e] |
| Hiriq | ִ | [i] |
| Holam | ֹ | [o] |
| Qubutz | ֻ | [u] |
| Shva | ְ | [ə] or silent |

Example of a word with Niqqud: **דָּבָר** (davar, “word”)

## Phonology

### Consonants

Biblical Hebrew had a rich consonant system, including emphatic consonants and pharyngeal consonants. Some of these sounds are no longer present in Modern Hebrew.

Notable consonant features:
- Emphatic consonants: ט [tˤ], צ [sˤ]
- Pharyngeal consonants: ח [ħ], ע [ʕ]
- Distinction between שׁ [ʃ] and שׂ [s]

### Vowels

The vowel system of Biblical Hebrew included both short and long vowels:

Short vowels: [a], [ɛ], [i], [ɔ], [u]
Long vowels: [aː], [eː], [iː], [oː], [uː]

### Stress

Stress in Biblical Hebrew typically falls on the last syllable (ultimate stress) or the second-to-last syllable (penultimate stress). Some words have stress on the third-to-last syllable (antepenultimate stress), but this is rare.

Examples:
- Ultimate stress: **דָּבָר** [daˈvar] (“word”)
- Penultimate stress: **מֶלֶךְ** [ˈmɛlɛx] (“king”)

## Morphology

Biblical Hebrew is a highly inflected language with a rich morphological system.

### Nouns

Nouns in Biblical Hebrew are inflected for:
- Gender (masculine or feminine)
- Number (singular, plural, or dual)
- State (absolute or construct)

#### Gender

Most nouns have inherent gender, either masculine or feminine. Some general patterns:
- Nouns ending in ה- or ת- are often feminine
- Most other nouns are masculine

Examples:
- Masculine: **סוּס** (sus, “horse”)
- Feminine: **סוּסָה** (susah, “mare”)

#### Number

Nouns can be singular, plural, or dual. Plural formation often involves adding suffixes:
- Masculine plural: ים-
- Feminine plural: וֹת-

Examples:
- Singular: **מֶלֶךְ** (melekh, “king”)
- Plural: **מְלָכִים** (melakhim, “kings”)

Dual is used for naturally paired items:
- **יָדַיִם** (yadayim, “hands”)
- **עֵינַיִם** ('einayim, “eyes”)

#### State

Nouns can be in the absolute state or the construct state. The construct state is used when a noun is in a possessive relationship with a following noun.

Example:
- Absolute: **דְּבַר** (devar, “word of”)
- Construct: **דְּבַר־יְהוָה** (devar-YHWH, “word of YHWH”)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Biblical Hebrew:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | **אֲנִי** / **אָנֹכִי** (ani / anokhi) | **אֲנַחְנוּ** (anachnu) |
| 2nd masc. | **אַתָּה** (attah) | **אַתֶּם** (attem) |
| 2nd fem. | **אַתְּ** (att) | **אַתֵּנָה** / **אַתֶּן** (attenah / atten) |
| 3rd masc. | **הוּא** (hu) | **הֵם** / **הֵמָּה** (hem / hemmah) |
| 3rd fem. | **הִיא** (hi) | **הֵן** / **הֵנָּה** (hen / hennah) |

Demonstrative pronouns:
- Near: **זֶה** (zeh, “this” masc.), **זֹאת** (zot, “this” fem.)
- Far: **הוּא** (hu, “that” masc.), **הִיא** (hi, “that” fem.)

### Verbs

The Hebrew verbal system is based on roots, typically consisting of three consonants (triliteral roots). These roots are inserted into various patterns (binyanim) to create different verb forms.

#### Binyanim

There are seven main binyanim in Biblical Hebrew:

1. **Qal**: Simple active
2. **Nif'al**: Simple passive or reflexive
3. **Pi'el**: Intensive active
4. **Pu'al**: Intensive passive
5. **Hif'il**: Causative active
6. **Hof'al**: Causative passive
7. **Hitpa'el**: Reflexive/reciprocal

Example with the root ק-ט-ל (q-t-l, related to “killing”):
- Qal: **קָטַל** (qatal, “he killed”)
- Nif'al: **נִקְטַל** (niqtal, “he was killed”)
- Pi'el: **קִטֵּל** (qittel, “he massacred”)
- Pu'al: **קֻטַּל** (quttal, “he was massacred”)
- Hif'il: **הִקְטִיל** (hiqtil, “he caused to kill”)
- Hof'al: **הָקְטַל** (hoqtal, “he was caused to be killed”)
- Hitpa'el: **הִתְקַטֵּל** (hitqattel, “he killed himself”)

#### Conjugation

Verbs are conjugated for:
- Person (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Gender (masculine, feminine)
- Number (singular, plural)
- Tense/Aspect (perfect, imperfect, imperative, infinitive, participle)

Example: Qal conjugation of **שָׁמַר** (shamar, “to guard”) in the perfect tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | **שָׁמַרְתִּי** (shamarti) | **שָׁמַרְנוּ** (shamarnu) |
| 2nd masc. | **שָׁמַרְתָּ** (shamarta) | **שְׁמַרְתֶּם** (shemartem) |
| 2nd fem. | **שָׁמַרְתְּ** (shamart) | **שְׁמַרְתֶּן** (shemarten) |
| 3rd masc. | **שָׁמַר** (shamar) | **שָׁמְרוּ** (shamru) |
| 3rd fem. | **שָׁמְרָה** (shamerah) | **שָׁמְרוּ** (shamru) |

#### Weak Verbs

Many Hebrew verbs are “weak,” meaning one or more of their root letters undergo changes in certain forms. Common types of weak verbs include:

1. Pe-Nun verbs: First root letter is נ (nun)
   Example: **נָפַל** (nafal, “to fall”)

2. Ayin-Vav/Yod verbs: Middle root letter is ו (vav) or י (yod)
   Example: **קוּם** (qum, “to rise”)

3. Lamed-He verbs: Last root letter is ה (he)
   Example: **בָּנָה** (banah, “to build”)

### Particles

Biblical Hebrew has various particles that serve grammatical functions:

1. Definite article: **הַ** (ha-)
   Example: **הַמֶּלֶךְ** (ha-melekh, “the king”)

2. Prepositions:
   - **בְּ** (be-, “in, at, with”)
   - **לְ** (le-, “to, for”)
   - **מִן** (min, “from”)
   Example: **בַּבַּיִת** (ba-bayit, “in the house”)

3. Conjunction: **וְ** (ve-, “and”)
   Example: **אִישׁ וְאִשָּׁה** (ish ve-ishah, “man and woman”)

4. Relative pronoun: **אֲשֶׁר** (asher, “who, which, that”)
   Example: **הָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר רָאִיתִי** (ha-ish asher ra'iti, “the man whom I saw”)

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Biblical Hebrew is typically Verb-Subject-Object (VSO), although variations are common for emphasis or in specific constructions.

Example:
**וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים יְהִי אוֹר** (vayyomer Elohim yehi or)
“And God said, 'Let there be light'”

### Construct Chain

The construct chain is a common feature in Biblical Hebrew, used to express possession or close relationship between nouns. In a construct chain, only the last noun is in the absolute state; all preceding nouns are in the construct state.

Example:
**בֵּית הַמֶּלֶךְ** (beit ha-melekh, “house of the king”)

### Verbal System

The Biblical Hebrew verbal system is based on aspect rather than tense. The two main forms are:

1. Perfect (qatal): Generally used for completed actions
   Example: **שָׁמַרְתִּי** (shamarti, “I guarded/have guarded”)

2. Imperfect (yiqtol): Generally used for incomplete or habitual actions
   Example: **אֶשְׁמֹר** (eshmor, “I will guard/guard habitually”)

The aspect can be modified by context and the use of the vav consecutive (ו), which often reverses the typical aspect of the verb form:

- Vav consecutive with perfect: Often translated as a past narrative sequence
  Example: **וַיֹּאמֶר** (vayyomer, “and he said”)

- Vav consecutive with imperfect: Often used for future or consequential actions
  Example: **וְשָׁמַרְתָּ** (veshamarta, “and you shall keep”)

### Verbless Clauses

Biblical Hebrew frequently uses verbless clauses, especially for expressing states of being or equivalence.

Example:
**טוֹב הַדָּבָר** (tov ha-davar, “The word [is] good”)

### Direct Object Marker

The particle **אֵת** (et) is used to mark definite direct objects.

Example:
**וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים אֶת־הָאוֹר** (vayyar Elohim et-ha'or, “And God saw the light”)

## Vocabulary

Biblical Hebrew vocabulary is relatively limited compared to modern languages, with the Hebrew Bible containing about 8,000 distinct words. Many words have multiple meanings, and context is crucial for interpretation.

## Poetic Devices

Biblical Hebrew poetry employs various literary devices:

1. Parallelism: The repetition of similar or contrasting ideas in adjacent lines
   Example from Psalm 19:1:
   **הַשָּׁמַיִם מְסַפְּרִים כְּבוֹד־אֵל**
   **וּמַעֲשֵׂה יָדָיו מַגִּיד הָרָקִיעַ**
   (The heavens declare the glory of God,
   and the firmament proclaims his handiwork)

2. Chiasmus: A crosswise arrangement of concepts or words
   Example from Psalm 124:7:
   **נַפְשֵׁנוּ כְּצִפּוֹר נִמְלְטָה מִפַּח יוֹקְשִׁים**
   **הַפַּח נִשְׁבָּר וַאֲנַחְנוּ נִמְלָטְנוּ**
   (Our soul has escaped as a bird from the snare of the fowlers;
   The snare is broken, and we have escaped)

3. Acrostic: Poems where each line or stanza begins with successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet
   Example: Psalm 119, where each stanza begins with a successive letter

4. Alliteration: The repetition of consonant sounds
   Example from Genesis 1:1:
   **בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים**

   Example: **מוֹת תָּמוּת** (mot tamut, lit. “dying you will die”)
   Meaning: “You will surely die”

2. Cohortative: First-person volitional form
   Example: **אֶשְׁמְרָה** (eshmerah, “let me guard”)

3. Jussive: Third-person volitional form
   Example: **יְהִי אוֹר** (yehi or, “let there be light”)

4. Waw Consecutive: Converts the aspect of a verb
   Example: **וַיֹּאמֶר** (vayyomer, “and he said”) - converts imperfect to narrative past

5. Casus Pendens: Fronting a noun phrase for emphasis
   Example: **הָאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר אַתָּה שֹׁכֵב עָלֶיהָ לְךָ אֶתְּנֶנָּה**
   (The land on which you are lying, to you I will give it)

## Differences between Classical and Late Biblical Hebrew

The Hebrew Bible spans a considerable time period, and linguistic changes are observable:

1. Spelling:
   Classical: **דָּוִד** (David)
   Late: **דָּוִיד** (David)

2. Pronouns:
   Classical: **אַתְּ** (att, “you” fem. sg.)
   Late: **אַתִּי** (atti, “you” fem. sg.)

3. Vocabulary:
   Classical: **פֶּן** (pen, “lest”)
   Late: **שֶׁמָּא** (shemma, “lest”)

4. Syntax:
   Increased use of the definite article and object marker in Late Biblical Hebrew

## Influence on Later Hebrew

Biblical Hebrew has had a profound influence on later forms of Hebrew:

1. Mishnaic Hebrew: The language of the Mishnah and other rabbinic literature, which shows significant grammatical changes but retains much Biblical vocabulary

2. Medieval Hebrew: Used in poetry and philosophical works, often deliberately archaizing to imitate Biblical style

3. Modern Hebrew: Revived as a spoken language in the 19th-20th centuries, drawing heavily on Biblical vocabulary and morphology while adapting to modern needs

Example of Biblical influence in Modern Hebrew:
Biblical: **וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים יְהִי אוֹר וַיְהִי־אוֹר**
(And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light)

Modern: **הַמּוֹרָה אָמְרָה: “יֵשׁ שִׁעוּרֵי בַּיִת” וְהָיוּ שִׁעוּרֵי בַּיִת**
(The teacher said, “There is homework,” and there was homework)

This modern sentence playfully imitates the Biblical syntax and vocabulary to describe a mundane situation.
