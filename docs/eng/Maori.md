# Maori

Maori, also known as Te Reo Maori or simply Te Reo (meaning "the language"), is the indigenous language of New Zealand (Aotearoa). It is an Eastern Polynesian language closely related to Cook Islands Maori, Tahitian, and Hawaiian. Maori is spoken by approximately 185,000 people, primarily in New Zealand. The language has undergone a significant revival effort since the 1970s, with immersion schools (kura kaupapa Maori) and increased presence in media and public life contributing to its preservation and growth.

## Phonology and Orthography

Maori has a relatively simple phonological system consisting of 10 consonants and 5 vowels. The language is written using the Latin alphabet, which was introduced by European missionaries in the early 19th century.

### Consonants

| Letter | IPA | Description | Example |
|--------|-----|-------------|---------|
| h | [h] | Glottal fricative | **haka** [haka] (ceremonial dance) |
| k | [k] | Voiceless velar plosive | **kōrero** [koːɾeɾo] (to speak) |
| m | [m] | Bilabial nasal | **maunga** [mauŋa] (mountain) |
| n | [n] | Alveolar nasal | **nui** [nui] (big) |
| ng | [ŋ] | Velar nasal | **ngahere** [ŋaheɾe] (forest) |
| p | [p] | Voiceless bilabial plosive | **pātai** [paːtai] (question) |
| r | [ɾ] | Alveolar tap | **rākau** [ɾaːkau] (tree) |
| t | [t] | Voiceless alveolar plosive | **tāne** [taːne] (man) |
| w | [w] | Labio-velar approximant | **wai** [wai] (water) |
| wh | [f] or [ɸ] | Voiceless bilabial or labiodental fricative | **whānau** [faːnau] or [ɸaːnau] (family) |

The pronunciation of 'wh' varies among dialects, with [f] being more common in the North Island and [ɸ] in the South Island. This variation is an important feature of regional dialects and is often maintained even in standardized Maori.

### Vowels

| Letter | IPA | Description | Example |
|--------|-----|-------------|---------|
| a | [a] | Open front unrounded vowel | **aroha** [aɾoha] (love) |
| e | [ɛ] | Open-mid front unrounded vowel | **eketone** [ɛkɛtɔnɛ] (limestone) |
| i | [i] | Close front unrounded vowel | **iwi** [iwi] (tribe) |
| o | [ɔ] | Open-mid back rounded vowel | **ono** [ɔnɔ] (six) |
| u | [u] | Close back rounded vowel | **umu** [umu] (earth oven) |

Long vowels are indicated by a macron (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū) and are phonemically distinct from their short counterparts. The use of macrons is crucial for correct pronunciation and meaning differentiation. For example:

- **keke** [kɛkɛ] (cake) vs. **kēkē** [kɛːkɛː] (armpit)
- **kaka** [kaka] (garment) vs. **kākā** [kaːkaː] (parrot)

### Diphthongs

Maori has several diphthongs, which are important for correct pronunciation and meaning:

- ai [ai]: **kai** [kai] (food)
- ae [ae]: **mae** [mae] (wither)
- ao [ao]: **Aotearoa** [aɔtɛaɾɔa] (New Zealand)
- au [au]: **kau** [kau] (swim)
- ei [ei]: **tei** [tei] (younger sibling)
- ou [ou]: **kou** [kou] (singing)

### Stress

Stress in Maori words typically falls on the first long vowel. If there are no long vowels, stress falls on the first syllable. This rule is crucial for proper pronunciation and comprehension. For example:

- **mātau** [ˈmaːtau] (to know)
- **aroha** [ˈaɾoha] (love)
- **whakamārama** [ˌfakaˈmaːɾama] (to explain)

In compound words, each part may retain its own stress:

- **whare + kura** → **wharekura** [ˈfaɾeˌkuɾa] (school)

### Syllable Structure

Maori syllables typically follow a (C)V(V) structure, where C is a consonant and V is a vowel. This means that every syllable must end in a vowel, and consonant clusters are not allowed within syllables. This structure gives Maori its characteristic rhythm and flow. Examples:

- **ta.nga.ta** [ta.ŋa.ta] (person)
- **whai.ko.re.ro** [fai.kɔ.ɾe.ɾɔ] (speech)
- **Ao.te.a.ro.a** [aɔ.te.a.ɾɔ.a] (New Zealand)

This syllable structure is important for learners to master, as it affects pronunciation, stress patterns, and the overall rhythm of the language.

## Morphology

Maori morphology is characterized by its use of particles, prefixes, and suffixes to modify the meaning of words. Unlike many Indo-European languages, Maori does not rely heavily on inflection for grammatical functions.

### Nouns

Maori nouns do not inflect for number, gender, or case. Plurality is typically indicated by context or through the use of numerals or quantifiers.

#### Personal Nouns

Personal nouns often take the particle **a** before them, which serves as a personal article:

- **a Hemi** (Hemi, as a person's name)
- **a Pita** (Peter)
- **a Rangi** (Rangi)

This particle is used in various constructions, particularly when indicating possession or agency:

- **Te whare o a Mere** (Mere's house)
- **I haere a Tama ki te kura** (Tama went to school)

#### Place Names

Place names often take the particle **i** (in, at) before them when indicating location:

- **i Aotearoa** (in New Zealand)
- **i Rotorua** (in Rotorua)
- **i Te Whanganui-a-Tara** (in Wellington)

When indicating movement towards a place, the particle **ki** is used:

- **ki Tāmaki Makaurau** (to Auckland)
- **ki Te Waipounamu** (to the South Island)

#### Compound Nouns

Maori frequently forms compound nouns by combining two or more words. This process is productive and allows for the creation of new terms, especially for modern concepts:

- **whare** (house) + **kai** (food) → **wharekai** (dining hall)
- **waka** (vehicle) + **rererangi** (flying) → **wakarererangi** (airplane)
- **reo** (language) + **irirangi** (radio) → **reoirirangi** (radio language, broadcasting)

### Pronouns

Maori pronouns distinguish between singular, dual, and plural forms, as well as inclusive and exclusive first person plural. This system reflects the importance of group identity and relationships in Maori culture.

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st (excl.) | au/ahau | māua | mātou |
| 1st (incl.) | - | tāua | tātou |
| 2nd | koe | kōrua | koutou |
| 3rd | ia | rāua | rātou |

Examples:

- **Kei te haere au** (I am going)
- **Kei te mahi māua** (We two are working - exclusive)
- **Kei te noho tātou** (We all are staying - inclusive)
- **Ka haere kōrua ki te kura** (You two will go to school)
- **Kua tae mai rātou** (They have arrived)

The inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first person plural is particularly important in Maori discourse:

- **Kei te haere mātou ki te hui** (We (excl.) are going to the meeting - not including the listener)
- **Kei te haere tātou ki te hui** (We (incl.) are going to the meeting - including the listener)

### Possessives

Maori uses different possessive particles depending on the relationship between the possessor and the possessed. There are two main categories: a-possession (generally for alienable possession) and o-possession (generally for inalienable possession).

A-possession (generally for things that are acquired or controlled):
- **tāku** (my, singular)
- **ā māua** (our, exclusive dual)
- **ā mātou** (our, exclusive plural)
- **ā tāua** (our, inclusive dual)
- **ā tātou** (our, inclusive plural)

O-possession (generally for things that are inherent or not controlled):
- **tōku** (my, singular)
- **ō māua** (our, exclusive dual)
- **ō mātou** (our, exclusive plural)
- **ō tāua** (our, inclusive dual)
- **ō tātou** (our, inclusive plural)

Examples:

- **tāku pukapuka** (my book)
- **tōku whānau** (my family)
- **ā rātou tamariki** (their children)
- **ō tātou tīpuna** (our ancestors)

The choice between a-possession and o-possession can sometimes change the meaning of a phrase:

- **tāku kōrero** (my speech, something I composed)
- **tōku kōrero** (what was said about me)

This distinction is crucial for expressing relationships and ownership correctly in Maori.

### Verbs

Maori verbs do not conjugate for person or number. Tense, aspect, and mood are indicated by particles that precede the verb. This system allows for precise expression of time and aspect without changing the form of the verb itself.

#### Tense/Aspect Markers

- **i** (past tense): **I haere au** (I went)
- **kei te** (present continuous): **Kei te mahi ia** (He/she is working)
- **e ... ana** (present continuous, alternative form): **E mahi ana ia** (He/she is working)
- **ka** (future or narrative present): **Ka tae mai rātou** (They will arrive)
- **kua** (perfect aspect): **Kua oti te mahi** (The work has been completed)
- **i te** (past continuous): **I te ako au i te reo Māori** (I was learning Maori)
- **kia** (subjunctive): **Kia kaha!** (Be strong!)

Examples of usage:

- **I haere au ki te tāone inanahi** (I went to town yesterday)
- **Kei te ako ngā tamariki i te reo Māori** (The children are learning Maori)
- **Ka tīmata te hui ā te Rātū** (The meeting will start on Tuesday)
- **Kua mutu te mahi** (The work has finished)

#### Passive Voice

The passive voice is formed by adding suffixes to the verb. Common passive suffixes include -tia, -a, -hia, -ina, -na. The choice of suffix depends on the verb and can vary dialectally.

- **korero** (to speak) → **kōrerotia** (to be spoken)
- **inu** (to drink) → **inumia** (to be drunk)
- **kai** (to eat) → **kainga** (to be eaten)
- **mahi** (to work, do) → **mahia** (to be done)

Examples:
- **I kōrerotia te reo Māori e ia** (Maori was spoken by him/her)
- **Kua kainga te kai e ngā manuhiri** (The food has been eaten by the guests)

The passive voice is more common in Maori than in English and is often used where English would use an active construction.

#### Causative Prefix

The causative prefix **whaka-** is used to form verbs meaning "to cause to" or "to make". This prefix is highly productive and can be applied to many words to create new verbs:

- **pai** (good) → **whakapai** (to improve)
- **mahana** (warm) → **whakamahana** (to warm up)
- **nui** (big) → **whakanui** (to enlarge, to celebrate)
- **mārama** (clear, understood) → **whakamārama** (to explain)

Examples:
- **Ka whakapai au i te whare** (I will improve the house)
- **E whakamahana ana ia i te kai** (She is warming up the food)
- **I whakanui rātou i te Kirihimete** (They celebrated Christmas)

The **whaka-** prefix can also be used with nouns to create verbs:

- **tauira** (student) → **whakatauira** (to demonstrate, to set an example)

#### Stative Verbs

Maori has a class of verbs known as stative verbs, which describe states or conditions rather than actions. These verbs often correspond to adjectives in English:

- **māuiui** (to be sick)
- **hari** (to be happy)
- **mate** (to be dead, to die)
- **ora** (to be alive, to live)

These verbs are used with the same tense/aspect markers as other verbs:

- **Kei te māuiui au** (I am sick)
- **I hari rātou** (They were happy)
- **Kua mate te rākau** (The tree has died)

### Adjectives

In Maori, many words can function as both nouns and adjectives depending on their position in the sentence. Adjectives typically follow the noun they modify.

- **he whare nui** (a big house)
- **he tangata pai** (a good person)
- **te rākau teitei** (the tall tree)

Comparative and superlative forms are usually expressed using adverbs:

- **ake** (more)
- **rawa** (most)

Examples:
- **He nui ake tēnei whare** (This house is bigger)
- **Ko ia te tangata pai rawa** (He/she is the best person)

Maori also uses reduplication to intensify the meaning of adjectives:

- **nui** (big) → **nunui** (very big)
- **iti** (small) → **itiiti** (very small)

Example:
- **He whare nunui tēnā** (That is a very big house)

## Syntax

Maori syntax is characterized by its Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) word order, use of particles to indicate grammatical functions, and a rich system of pronouns and possessives.

### Basic Sentence Structure

Maori typically follows a Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) word order, although other orders are possible for emphasis or in certain constructions.

- **Kei te kai a Hemi i te āporo** (Hemi is eating the apple)
  V S O

- **I patu te tangata i te kurī** (The man hit the dog)
  V S O

However, in sentences with stative verbs, the order is often Verb-Subject:

- **Kua mate te kurī** (The dog has died)
  V S

### Equational Sentences

Equational sentences (sentences that equate two noun phrases) use the particle **he** for indefinite statements and **ko** for definite or emphatic statements.

- **He nēhi ia** (She is a nurse)
- **He tangata pai a Hone** (John is a good person)
- **Ko Hemi te kaiwhakaako** (Hemi is the teacher)
- **Ko tēnei te whare o tōku whaea** (This is my aunt's house)

The **ko** construction is also used for topicalization, bringing the focus to a particular element:

- **Ko āpōpō mātou haere ai** (It's tomorrow that we're going)

### Question Formation

Questions are often formed by using question words or particles:

- **aha** (what): **He aha tēnā?** (What is that?)
- **wai** (who): **Ko wai tō ingoa?** (What is your name? Literally: Who is your name?)
- **hea** (where): **Kei hea te whare?** (Where is the house?)
- **pēhea** (how): **Kei te pēhea koe?** (How are you?)
- **āhea** (when, future): **Āhea koe haere ai?** (When will you go?)
- **nōnāhea** (when, past): **Nōnāhea koe i tae mai ai?** (When did you arrive?)
- **ēhia** (how many): **E hia ngā tamariki?** (How many children?)

Yes/no questions can be formed by adding the particle **rānei** at the end of a statement:

- **Kei te haere koe ki te kura rānei?** (Are you going to school?)

Alternatively, intonation alone can be used to form yes/no questions:

- **Kei te haere koe ki te kura?** (Are you going to school?)

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed using **kāore** or **ehara**:

- **Kāore au i te mōhio** (I don't know)
- **Kāore he kai** (There is no food)
- **Ehara tēnei i te pene** (This is not a pen)
- **Ehara au i te Māori** (I am not Maori)

For imperative sentences, **kaua** is used for negation:

- **Kaua e haere!** (Don't go!)

### Locatives

Maori uses several locative particles to indicate spatial relationships:

- **i** (at, in - past tense): **I noho au i te whare** (I stayed at home)
- **ki** (to, towards): **Ka haere au ki te tāone** (I will go to town)
- **kei** (at, present location): **Kei te whare au** (I am at home)
- **nō** (from, origin): **Nō Aotearoa ahau** (I am from New Zealand)

These particles are crucial for expressing location and movement:

- **I haere ia i Tāmaki ki Pōneke** (She went from Auckland to Wellington)
- **Kei hea te pukapuka?** (Where is the book?)
- **Nō whea koe?** (Where are you from?)

### Temporal Expressions

Time in Maori is often expressed using specific particles and phrases:

- **ināianei** (now): **Kei te kai au ināianei** (I am eating now)
- **āpōpō** (tomorrow): **Ka haere au āpōpō** (I will go tomorrow)
- **inanahi** (yesterday): **I haere au inanahi** (I went yesterday)
- **i tērā wiki** (last week): **I tae mai ia i tērā wiki** (He arrived last week)
- **ā tērā marama** (next month): **Ka tīmata te kura ā tērā marama** (School will start next month)

### Subordinate Clauses

Maori uses various particles to introduce subordinate clauses:

- **e ... ana** (while, when): **I kite au i a ia e haere ana** (I saw him while he was going)
- **i ... ai** (when, past): **I haere au i tae mai ai ia** (I went when he arrived)
- **kia** (so that, until): **Ka tatari au kia tae mai koe** (I'll wait until you arrive)
- **mehemea** (if): **Mehemea ka ua, ka noho au ki te kāinga** (If it rains, I'll stay at home)

## Vocabulary

Maori vocabulary reflects the cultural and environmental context of New Zealand. Many words have been borrowed or adapted to describe introduced concepts, while others have been created using existing Maori morphemes.

### Numbers

The Maori number system is decimal-based:

- 1-10: **tahi**, **rua**, **toru**, **whā**, **rima**, **ono**, **whitu**, **waru**, **iwa**, **tekau**
- 11-19: **tekau mā tahi**, **tekau mā rua**, etc.
- 20: **rua tekau**
- 21: **rua tekau mā tahi**
- 100: **kotahi rau**
- 1000: **kotahi mano**

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding **tuatahi** (first), **tuarua** (second), etc.:

- **te rā tuatahi** (the first day)
- **te whare tuarua** (the second house)

### Days of the Week

- Monday: **Rāhina**
- Tuesday: **Rātū**
- Wednesday: **Rāapa**
- Thursday: **Rāpare**
- Friday: **Rāmere**
- Saturday: **Rāhoroi**
- Sunday: **Rātapu**

These names are compounds of **rā** (day) and various other elements, some of which are borrowings from English (e.g., **Rātū** from Tuesday).

### Months

- January: **Kohi-tātea**
- February: **Hui-tanguru**
- March: **Poutū-te-rangi**

- **matua** (father)
- **whaea** (mother)
- **tuakana** (older sibling of the same gender)
- **teina** (younger sibling of the same gender)
- **tuahine** (sister of a male)
- **tungāne** (brother of a female)
- **koro** (grandfather)
- **kuia** (grandmother)
- **mokopuna** (grandchild)

### Loanwords

Maori has incorporated many loanwords, particularly for introduced concepts. Some are direct borrowings, while others are calques or neologisms created from Maori roots:

- Car: **motokā** (from "motor car")
- Computer: **rorohiko** (lit. "electric brain")
- Television: **pouaka whakaata** (lit. "box of images")

## Dialectal Variation

While Maori is relatively uniform across New Zealand, there are some regional variations in pronunciation and vocabulary. Some of the main dialect areas include:

1. Northland (Te Tai Tokerau)
2. Waikato-Tainui
3. Bay of Plenty (Tauranga Moana)
4. East Coast (Te Tai Rāwhiti)
5. Taranaki
6. Wellington-Horowhenua
7. South Island (Te Waipounamu)

Examples of dialectal differences:

- The pronunciation of 'wh' as [f] or [ɸ], as mentioned earlier
- Variation in certain words, e.g., "kumara" (sweet potato) is **kūmara** in some areas and **rīwai** in others
- Slight differences in intonation and stress patterns
- Use of different particles in some constructions, e.g., **ana** vs. **nei** for the present continuous in some regions

These dialectal variations are often maintained and celebrated as part of the rich linguistic heritage of different iwi (tribes) and regions.

## Colloquial Maori

Colloquial Maori, especially as used by younger speakers, often incorporates English loanwords and code-switching. Some examples of colloquial usage:

- **Kei te pēhea to weekend?** (How was your weekend?)
- **Ka pai to mahi, bro** (Good job, bro)
- **Haere tāua ki te mall** (Let's go to the mall)

Additionally, some traditional Maori words have taken on new meanings in colloquial usage:

- **Ka mau te wehi** (literally "held in awe," used colloquially to mean "awesome" or "cool")
- **Tau kē** (literally "settled differently," used to mean "awesome" or "choice")
- **Pō marie** (literally "peaceful night," used as "good night")

These colloquial expressions reflect the living nature of the language and its adaptation to modern contexts.
