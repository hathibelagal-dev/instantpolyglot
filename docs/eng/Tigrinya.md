# Tigrinya

Tigrinya (ትግርኛ, tǝgrǝñña) is an Ethio-Semitic language spoken primarily in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia, particularly in the Tigray Region. It is closely related to Amharic and Ge'ez, sharing many linguistic features with these languages. Tigrinya is spoken by approximately 9 million people as a first or second language.

## Writing System

Tigrinya uses the Ge'ez script (ፊደል fidäl), which is an abugida writing system. Each symbol represents a consonant-vowel sequence, and vowels are indicated by modifications to the base consonant symbol.

### Consonants

| በ | b |
| ተ | t |
| ቸ | č |
| ኀ | ḫ |
| ነ | n |

2. u (second order)
3. i (third order)
4. a (fourth order)
5. e (fifth order)
6. ǝ (sixth order)
7. o (seventh order)

For example, the consonant "ለ" (l) can be modified as follows:

| Form | Transliteration |
|------|-----------------|
| ለ | lä |
| ሉ | lu |
| ሊ | li |
| ላ | la |
| ሌ | le |
| ል | lǝ |
| ሎ | lo |

### Labialization

Tigrinya also has labialized consonants, which are represented by adding a small "ው" (w) to the base consonant. For example:

- ቈ (qwä)
- ኰ (kwä)
- ጐ (gwä)

## Phonology

### Consonants

Tigrinya has a rich consonant inventory, including ejective consonants:

| Manner | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Plosive | b p p' | t d t' | | k g k' | ʔ |
| Affricate | | ts ts' | tʃ tʃ' | | |

### Vowels

Tigrinya has seven vowel phonemes:

| Front | Central | Back |
|-------|---------|------|
| i | ɨ | u |
| e | ä | o |
| | a | |

### Phonological Processes

1. Gemination: Consonants can be lengthened for grammatical or lexical purposes.
   Example: **ሰበረ** /säbärä/ "he broke" vs. **ሰበበረ** /säbbärä/ "he broke repeatedly"

2. Palatalization: Some consonants become palatalized before front vowels.
   Example: **ጌታ** /geta/ "master" becomes [ɡʲeta]

3. Assimilation: Consonants often assimilate to neighboring sounds.
   Example: **እንብል** /ʔɨnbɨl/ "let's say" is often pronounced [ʔɨmbɨl]

## Morphology

Tigrinya is a highly inflected language with complex morphology for both nouns and verbs.

### Nouns

Nouns in Tigrinya are inflected for number, gender, and definiteness.

#### Gender

Tigrinya has two genders: masculine and feminine. Most nouns ending in -ä are masculine, while those ending in -i or -a are typically feminine.

Masculine: **ቤት** /bet/ "house"
Feminine: **ሃገር** /hagär/ "country"

#### Number

Nouns can be singular or plural. Plural formation is often irregular, but some common patterns include:

1. Adding -at: 
   **መጽሓፍ** /mäṣḥaf/ "book" → **መጻሕፍቲ** /mäṣaḥǝfti/ "books"

2. Internal vowel change:
   **ዓይኒ** /ʿayni/ "eye" → **ዓይነይ** /ʿaynäy/ "eyes"

3. Irregular plurals:
   **ሰብ** /säb/ "person" → **ሰባት** /säbat/ "people"

#### Definiteness

The definite article is expressed by suffixing -u (masculine) or -ti (feminine) to the noun:

**ቤት** /bet/ "house" → **ቤቱ** /betu/ "the house"
**ሃገር** /hagär/ "country" → **ሃገርቲ** /hagärti/ "the country"

### Verbs

Tigrinya verbs are highly complex, with inflections for person, number, gender, tense, aspect, and mood. The root-and-pattern system common to Semitic languages is used.

#### Verb Stems

Verbs are based on tri-consonantal roots, with different patterns used to create various stems:

1. Perfect stem: CäCCäCä
2. Imperfect stem: -CäCCǝC
3. Jussive/Imperative stem: CǝCäC

Example with the root k-t-b (write):
- Perfect: **ከተበ** /kätäbä/
- Imperfect: **ይከትብ** /yǝkättǝb/
- Jussive: **ይክተብ** /yǝktäb/

#### Person, Number, and Gender

Verbs agree with their subjects in person, number, and gender. Here's an example conjugation of the verb **ከተበ** /kätäbä/ "he wrote" in the perfect tense:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **ከተብኩ** /kätäbku/ | **ከተብና** /kätäbna/ |
| 2nd masc. | **ከተብካ** /kätäbka/ | **ከተብኩም** /kätäbkum/ |

| 3rd masc. | **ከተበ** /kätäbä/ | **ከተቡ** /kätäbu/ |
| 3rd fem. | **ከተበት** /kätäbät/ | **ከተባ** /kätäba/ |

#### Tense and Aspect

Tigrinya distinguishes between perfect and imperfect aspects:

1. Perfect: Completed actions
   **ከተበ** /kätäbä/ "he wrote"

2. Imperfect: Ongoing or habitual actions
   **ይጽሕፍ** /yǝṣḥǝf/ "he writes"

3. Gerund: Continuous actions
   **እናጸሓፈ** /ʾǝnaṣäḥafä/ "writing"

#### Derived Stems

Tigrinya has several derived verb stems that modify the meaning of the base verb:

1. Passive: formed by prefixing tä-
   **ተጻሕፈ** /täṣaḥfä/ "it was written"

2. Causative: formed by prefixing ʾa-
   **አጽሓፈ** /ʾaṣḥafä/ "he caused to write"

3. Frequentative: formed by doubling the middle radical
   **ከታተበ** /kättatäbä/ "he wrote repeatedly"

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Tigrinya agree with the nouns they modify in gender and number. They typically follow the noun:

**ዓቢይ ቤት** /ʿabiy bet/ "big house" (masculine)
**ዓባይ ሃገር** /ʿabay hagär/ "big country" (feminine)

Adjectives can be inflected for definiteness:

**ዓቢይ ቤት** /ʿabiy bet/ "big house"
**ዓቢዩ ቤት** /ʿabiyu bet/ "the big house"

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Tigrinya is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV):

**ጳውሎስ መጽሓፍ ከተበ።**
/p̣awlos mäṣḥaf kätäbä./
"Paul wrote a book."

However, word order can be more flexible for emphasis or in certain constructions.

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed by the particle **ኣይ-** /ʾay-/ before the verb and the suffix **-ን** /-n/ at the end of the verb:

**ጳውሎስ መጽሓፍ ኣይከተበን።**
/p̣awlos mäṣḥaf ʾaykätäbän./
"Paul did not write a book."

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the particle **ዶ** /do/ at the end of the sentence:

**ጳውሎስ መጽሓፍ ከተበ ዶ?**
/p̣awlos mäṣḥaf kätäbä do?/
"Did Paul write a book?"

Wh-questions use interrogative words such as:

- **መን** /män/ "who"
- **እንታይ** /ʾǝntay/ "what"
- **መዓዝ** /mäʿaz/ "when"
- **ኣበይ** /ʾabäy/ "where"

Example:
**መን መጽሓፍ ከተበ?**
/män mäṣḥaf kätäbä?/
"Who wrote a book?"

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Tigrinya are formed using the relative pronoun **ዝ-** /zǝ-/ prefixed to the verb:

**መጽሓፍ ዝከተበ ሰብ**
/mäṣḥaf zǝkätäbä säb/
"the person who wrote a book"

### Coordination

Coordination is achieved using conjunctions such as:

- **ን** /nǝ/ "and"
- **ወይ** /wäy/ "or"
- **ግን** /gǝn/ "but"

Example:
**ጳውሎስን ማርያምን መጽሓፍ ከተቡ።**
/p̣awlosǝn maryamǝn mäṣḥaf kätäbu./
"Paul and Mary wrote a book."

## Phonological and Morphological Processes

### Palatalization

In Tigrinya, certain consonants undergo palatalization when followed by front vowels. This process is particularly noticeable with velar consonants:

- /k/ → [kʲ] before /i/ or /e/
  Example: **ኪዳን** /kidan/ [kʲidan] "covenant"

- /g/ → [gʲ] before /i/ or /e/
  Example: **ግዕዝይና** /gǝʿǝzyǝna/ [gʲǝʿǝzjǝna] "sincerity"

### Labialization

Some consonants can be labialized, especially before rounded vowels:

- /k/ → [kʷ] before /o/ or /u/
  Example: **ኮኾብ** /kokob/ [kʷokʷob] "star"

### Assimilation

Tigrinya exhibits various assimilation processes:

1. Nasal assimilation:
   The prefix /n-/ assimilates to the place of articulation of the following consonant.
   Example: **ንጽሕፍ** /nǝṣḥǝf/ → [mǝṣḥǝf] "we write"

2. Voicing assimilation:
   Voiceless consonants can become voiced when adjacent to voiced consonants.
   Example: **አትከልከለ** /ʾatkälkälä/ → [ʾadgälkälä] "he prohibited"

### Gemination

Gemination (consonant lengthening) plays a crucial role in Tigrinya morphology and can change the meaning of words:

- **ሰበረ** /säbärä/ "he broke" vs. **ሰበበረ** /säbbärä/ "he broke repeatedly"
- **መለሰ** /mäläsä/ "he answered" vs. **መለለሰ** /mälläsä/ "he answered repeatedly"
