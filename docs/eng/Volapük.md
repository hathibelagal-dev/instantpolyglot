# Volapük

Volapük is an artificial language created in 1879-1880 by Johann Martin Schleyer, a Roman Catholic priest in Baden, Germany. It was one of the first constructed international auxiliary languages to achieve significant popularity, predating Esperanto. The name "Volapük" comes from two of its own words: "vol" (world) and "pük" (speech), meaning "world speech".

## Phonology and Orthography

## Morphology

Volapük has a rich morphological system, with features of both agglutinative and inflectional languages.

### Nouns

Nouns in Volapük are marked for case and number. There are four cases: nominative, genitive, dative, and accusative.

#### Declension

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | - | -s |
| Genitive | -a | -as |
| Dative | -e | -es |

- **flen** ('friend') → **jiflen** ('female friend'), **hiflen** ('male friend')

#### Compound Nouns

Compound nouns are formed by simply joining words together. The last word determines the grammatical properties of the compound.

Examples:
- **vol** ('world') + **pük** ('speech') → **volapük** ('world language')
- **mon** ('money') + **bok** ('box') → **monbok** ('money box', 'cash register')

### Adjectives

- **gretik** ('great', 'big')

Comparative and superlative forms:
- Comparative: add **-um**
  - **gudik** ('good') → **gudikum** ('better')
- Superlative: add **-ün**
  - **gudik** ('good') → **gudikün** ('best')

### Adverbs

## Syntax

Volapük generally follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, although other orders are possible due to its case system.

### Basic Sentence Structure

A typical Volapük sentence follows this structure:

Subject (Nominative) + Object (Accusative) + Verb

Example:
**Vom fleni lögof.**
('The woman loves the friend.')

However, due to the case system, other word orders are possible without changing the meaning:

**Fleni vom lögof.**
**Lögof vom fleni.**

All these sentences mean 'The woman loves the friend.'

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding **li** at the beginning of a statement:

**Li lögol obi?**
('Do you love me?')

Wh-questions use interrogative words:

- **kim** ('who')
- **kios** ('what')
- **kiöp** ('where')
- **kitim** ('when')
- **kikod** ('why')
- **kimiko** ('how')

Example:
**Kimi lögol?**
('Whom do you love?')

### Negation

Negation is expressed by the word **no** placed before the verb:

**Ob no lögob oli.**
('I don't love you.')

### Subordinate Clauses

Subordinate clauses are introduced by conjunctions such as:

- **das** ('that')
- **if** ('if')
- **bi** ('because')
- **ven** ('when')

Example:
**Ob saveob das lögol obi.**
('I know that you love me.')

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by the relative pronoun **kel**:

**Man, keli logob, binon flen obik.**
('The man whom I see is my friend.')

## Advanced Grammar

### Aspect

While Volapük doesn't have a complex aspect system like some natural languages, it does have ways to express aspectual distinctions:

1. Habitual aspect: Use the adverb **often**
   **Ob often tidob Volapüki.** - 'I (habitually) teach Volapük.'

2. Progressive aspect: Use the construction **binön + present participle**
   **Binob tidöl Volapüki.** - 'I am teaching Volapük.'

3. Perfective aspect: Use the past tense
   **Ätidob Volapüki.** - 'I taught/have taught Volapük.'

### Mood

In addition to the indicative, conditional, and imperative moods mentioned earlier, Volapük has other ways to express modality:

1. Subjunctive: Used for hypothetical situations, formed by adding **-la** to the verb stem
   **If älögola-la obi, äbinob-la lebenik.** - 'If you had loved me, I would have been happy.'

2. Optative: Expresses wishes, formed with **os-** prefix

**Klot koblägon.** - 'The dress blackens itself.' (becomes black)

### Reflexive and Reciprocal Constructions

Reflexive pronouns are formed by adding **-ok** to personal pronouns:
- **ob** → **obok**
- **ol** → **olok**

Example:
**Logob obi in migät.** - 'I see myself in the mirror.'

Reciprocal actions are expressed using **balvoto** ('each other'):
**Lögobs balvoti.** - 'We love each other.'

## Syntax (Advanced)

### Topicalization

While the default word order is SOV, Volapük allows for topicalization by moving an element to the front of the sentence:

**Fleni at, vom lögof oni.** - 'This friend, the woman loves him.'

### Cleft Sentences

Cleft sentences can be formed using **binon** ('to be') and the relative pronoun **kel**:

**Binon vom, kel lögof fleni.** - 'It is the woman who loves the friend.'

### Serial Verb Constructions

Volapük allows for serial verb constructions, where two or more verbs are used in sequence without conjunctions:

**Göb seadön fidön.** - 'I go sit eat.' (I go to sit and eat)

## Pragmatics

### Politeness

Politeness in Volapük is often expressed through the use of the conditional mood and certain adverbs:

**Ökanol-li givön obe buki?** - 'Could you give me the book?'
**Begob ole benö ad givön obe buki.** - 'I kindly ask you to give me the book.'

### Discourse Markers

Volapük has several discourse markers to structure conversation:

- **klu** - 'therefore'
- **ibo** - 'because'
- **do** - 'however'
- **söl** - 'moreover'

Example:
**Älödob in Yurop. Do, nun lödob in Siyop.** - 'I lived in Europe. However, now I live in Asia.'

## Dialectal Variations

While Volapük is an constructed language, it has undergone revisions and has some variations:

1. Original Schleyer's Volapük
2. Arie de Jong's Reformed Volapük (1931)
3. Modern Volapük (based on de Jong's reform)

The main differences lie in some grammatical structures and vocabulary choices. For example, the original Volapük used **päl** for 'father', while the reformed version uses **fat**.

## Sample Texts

Here are some sample texts in Volapük to illustrate its use:

1. The Lord's Prayer (Modern Volapük):

**O Fat obas, kel binol in süls,
paisaludomöz nem ola!
Kömomöd monargän ola!
Jenomöz vil olik,
äs in sül, i su tal.
Bodi obsik vädeliki givolös obes adelo.
E pardolös obes debis obsik,
äs id obs aipardobs debeles obas.
E no obis nindukolös in tendadi;
sod aidalivolös obis de bad.**

2. Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

**Mens valik pämotoms libik e leigik ko dinit e gitäts. Reason e konsien laboms e sötons kosädön balvoto ko spirit blatik.**

## Influence and Legacy

Although Volapük has been largely superseded by Esperanto as the most widely-used constructed international auxiliary language, it has left its mark:

1. It paved the way for later constructed languages, demonstrating both the potential and pitfalls of such projects.

2. Some Volapük words have entered other languages, such as "Volapuk" itself, which is used in some languages to mean "gibberish" or "nonsense language".

3. The concept of a "volapuk" as a universal language has inspired numerous literary and artistic works.

4. Volapük clubs and societies still exist in some parts of the world, maintaining interest in the language.

## Comparison with Other Constructed Languages

It's interesting to compare Volapük with other constructed languages, particularly Esperanto:

1. Vocabulary:
   - Volapük: **vol** (world), **pük** (language)
   - Esperanto: **mondo** (world), **lingvo** (language)

2. Alphabet:
   - Volapük uses umlauted vowels (ä, ö, ü)
   - Esperanto uses diacritics (ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, ŭ)

3. Grammar:
   - Volapük has a more complex case system (4 cases)
   - Esperanto has a simpler case system (2 cases: nominative and accusative)

4. Word order:
   - Volapük prefers SOV
   - Esperanto typically uses SVO

## Advanced Vocabulary Building

Volapük has a robust system for building complex words through compounding and affixation. Here are some advanced examples:

1. Compound words:
   - **motafat** = **mot** (mother) + **-a-** (genitive) + **fat** (father) = 'parent'
   - **vödabuk** = **vöd** (word) + **-a-** (genitive) + **buk** (book) = 'dictionary'
   - **yelacunöp** = **yel** (year) + **-a-** (genitive) + **cun** (hundred) + **-öp** (place) = 'century'

2. Words with multiple affixes:
   - **nedisevovälöl** = **ne-** (not) + **dis-** (apart) + **sev** (know) + **-ov-** (possibility) + **-äl** (past participle) = 'indiscernible'
   - **büologivan** = **bü-** (before) + **olog** (foresee) + **-i-** (connecting vowel) + **van** (ability) = 'prophetic'

## Volapük Literature

While not as extensive as some natural languages, Volapük has a body of literature, including original works and translations:

1. "Menad bal, pük bal" (One humanity, one language) - the Volapük anthem
2. Translations of religious texts, including parts of the Bible
3. Poetry collections, such as "Volapükageds" by Johann Schmidt
4. Short stories and novellas written by enthusiasts

Example of a Volapük poem (with translation):

**Volapük**

**O pük balid pelovepolöl,**
**Deadöl ä denu lifikolöl;**
**Nüns valik ole pagevobs:**
**In ol nu dönuö spelobs.**

(O first constructed language,
Dying and reviving again;
We give you all the news:
In you we hope anew.)

## Volapük in the Digital Age

Despite its decline, Volapük has found new life in the digital age:

1. Online communities: Forums and social media groups dedicated to Volapük
2. Digital resources: Online dictionaries, grammar guides, and learning materials
3. Unicode support: Volapük characters are fully supported in Unicode
4. Wikipedia: A Volapük version of Wikipedia exists (though with limited articles)

## Linguistic Features Unique to Volapük

1. Agglutinative verb conjugation: Volapük verbs can become quite long due to the agglutination of various markers:
   **äpölöfomoy** = **ä-** (past) + **pö-** (passive) + **löf** (love) + **-om** (3rd person singular masculine) + **-oy** (indefinite)
   Meaning: "He was loved (by someone unspecified)"

2. Extensive use of affixes: Volapük makes heavy use of prefixes and suffixes to modify meaning:
   **neletöfik** = **ne-** (not) + **let** (late) + **-öf** (tendency) + **-ik** (adjective)
   Meaning: "having a tendency to not be late"

3. Case system applied to adjectives: Unlike many languages where adjectives remain uninflected, Volapük adjectives can take case endings when used predicatively:
   **Dom binon gletik.** (The house is big.)
   **Logob domi gletiki.** (I see a big house.)

4. Systematic pronouns: Volapük pronouns are built systematically:
   **ob** (I), **ol** (you), **om** (he), **of** (she), **on** (it), **obs** (we), **ols** (you pl.), **oms** (they)

5. Vowel harmony in some affixes: Some Volapük affixes change their vowel to harmonize with the stem:
   **löf** (love) + **-ik** → **löfik** (loving)
   **gud** (good) + **-ik** → **gudik** (good)

## Challenges in Learning Volapük

1. Unfamiliar vocabulary: Many Volapük words are heavily modified from their source languages, making them difficult to recognize.

2. Complex verb system: The multitude of tenses, moods, and voices can be overwhelming for beginners.

3. Umlauted vowels: The frequent use of ä, ö, and ü can be challenging for speakers of languages that don't use these sounds.

4. Limited resources: Compared to more popular languages, learning materials for Volapük are scarce.

5. Lack of native speakers: As a constructed language, there are no native Volapük speakers to practice with or immerse oneself in the language.

## Volapük Humor

Even constructed languages can have jokes! Here's a Volapük pun:

**Kikod süm tän e Volapük?**
**Bi ols laboms vokis sümik!**

Translation:
"Why are a duck and Volapük similar?"
"Because they both have similar voices!"

(The pun works because **vok** means both "voice" and "vowel" in Volapük, and the language is known for its frequent use of umlauted vowels, which might sound like duck quacks to some.)

This overview covers various aspects of Volapük, from its basic grammar and vocabulary to more advanced topics and cultural aspects. It provides a comprehensive look at this historically significant constructed language.
