# Elfdalian

Elfdalian (Övdalsk: **Övdalską**) is a North Germanic language traditionally spoken in the parish of Älvdalen in northern Dalarna, Sweden. It is considered by some linguists to be a dialect of Swedish, while others classify it as a separate language due to its significant differences from Standard Swedish and limited mutual intelligibility. Elfdalian has retained many Old Norse features lost in other Scandinavian languages, making it of particular interest to historical linguists.

## Morphology

Elfdalian has retained many archaic grammatical features lost in other Scandinavian languages, including a complex system of noun declension and verb conjugation.

### Nouns

Nouns in Elfdalian are inflected for number (singular and plural) and case (nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive). The language has three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter.

Elfdalian syntax shares many features with other Germanic languages but has some unique characteristics.

### Word Order

The basic word order in Elfdalian is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), similar to other Scandinavian languages:

- **Ig sjår estn** (I see the horse)

In subordinate clauses, the word order can change to Subject-Object-Verb:

- **An såg at ig estn såg** (He saw that I saw the horse)

### Verb-Second (V2) Rule

Like other Germanic languages, Elfdalian follows the V2 rule in main clauses, where the finite verb must be the second constituent:

- **Igår såg ig estn** (Yesterday I saw the horse)
- **Estn såg ig igår** (The horse I saw yesterday)

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed using the adverb **int** (not), which follows the finite verb in main clauses:

- **Ig sjår int estn** (I don't see the horse)

In subordinate clauses, the negation precedes the finite verb:

- **An såg at ig int såg estn** (He saw that I didn't see the horse)

### Question Formation

Yes/no questions are formed by inverting the subject and the verb:

- **Sjår du estn?** (Do you see the horse?)

Wh-questions place the question word at the beginning of the sentence:

- **Wiso sjår du estn?** (Why do you see the horse?)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by the relative pronoun **såm**:

- **Estn såm ig såg** (The horse that I saw)

### Impersonal Constructions

Elfdalian uses impersonal constructions with the pronoun **eð** (it) for weather expressions and certain other contexts:

- **Eð rägner** (It's raining)
- **Eð ir kålt** (It's cold)
