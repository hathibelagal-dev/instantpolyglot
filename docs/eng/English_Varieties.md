# English Varieties

English, as a global language, has developed numerous varieties across the world, each with its own unique linguistic features. This document will explore in depth the phonological, grammatical, and lexical characteristics of major English varieties.

## Phonology

The sound systems of English varieties show significant variation, particularly in vowel pronunciation and prosodic features.

### Vowel Systems

1. The TRAP-BATH Split:
   This isogloss separates Southern British English (including Received Pronunciation) from most other varieties.

   - Southern British English: **bath** [bɑːθ], **grass** [ɡrɑːs], **dance** [dɑːns]
   - Northern English, American, Australian: **bath** [bæθ], **grass** [ɡræs], **dance** [dæns]

   This split occurred in southern England in the 17th-18th centuries, where the [æ] vowel lengthened and backed to [ɑː] before certain consonant clusters (f, s, th, ns, nt, nch, mpl, and others).

2. The LOT-CLOTH Split:
   This distinguishes most American English varieties from British English.

   - American English: **lot** [lɑt], **cloth** [klɔθ], **dog** [dɔɡ]
   - British English: **lot** [lɒt], **cloth** [klɒθ], **dog** [dɒɡ]

   In American English, words of the CLOTH lexical set are pronounced with the same vowel as THOUGHT, while in British English, they share the vowel of LOT.

3. The FOOT-STRUT Split:
   This split separates most English varieties from some Northern English dialects.

   - Standard British and American: **put** [pʊt], **strut** [strʌt], **butter** [ˈbʌtər]
   - Northern English: **put** [pʊt], **strut** [strʊt], **butter** [ˈbʊtə]

   The lack of this split in Northern English is sometimes called the "foot-strut merger."

4. The NURSE Merger:
   Most modern varieties of English have merged the vowels that were historically distinct in words like **fir**, **fur**, and **fern**. However, some Scottish and Irish varieties maintain a distinction:

   - Standard: **fir** [fɜːr], **fur** [fɜːr], **fern** [fɜːrn]
   - Some Scottish: **fir** [fɪr], **fur** [fʌr], **fern** [fɛrn]

5. The NORTH-FORCE Merger:
   Most varieties have merged these vowels, but they remain distinct in some conservative RP speakers and some Scottish dialects:

   - Most varieties: **for** [fɔːr], **four** [fɔːr]
   - Some RP and Scottish: **for** [fɔː], **four** [foː]

6. The MEAT-MEET Merger:
   This merger is complete in most varieties, but some conservative RP speakers and some Welsh English speakers maintain a distinction:

   - Most varieties: **meat** [miːt], **meet** [miːt]
   - Some RP and Welsh English: **meat** [mɪit], **meet** [miːt]

7. The PIN-PEN Merger:
   This merger is found in parts of the Southern United States and in African American Vernacular English (AAVE):

   - Standard: **pin** [pɪn], **pen** [pɛn]
   - Southern US and AAVE: **pin** [pɪn], **pen** [pɪn]

8. The CAUGHT-COT Merger:
   This merger is widespread in North America, particularly in the West and Canada:

   - Distinct (e.g., New York City): **caught** [kɔːt], **cot** [kɑt]
   - Merged (e.g., Western US): **caught** [kɑt], **cot** [kɑt]

### Consonant Features

1. Rhoticity:
   One of the most noticeable differences between English accents is rhoticity - whether the /r/ sound is pronounced in all positions or only before vowels.

   - Rhotic (e.g., General American, Scottish English, Irish English):
     **car** [kɑr], **park** [pɑrk], **butter** [ˈbʌtər]

   - Non-rhotic (e.g., RP, Australian English, New Zealand English):
     **car** [kɑː], **park** [pɑːk], **butter** [ˈbʌtə]

2. T-glottalization:
   In many British and Australasian accents, /t/ is often realized as a glottal stop [ʔ] in certain positions, particularly at the end of a syllable.

   - RP or careful speech: **bottle** [ˈbɒtl], **butter** [ˈbʌtə]
   - Glottalized: **bottle** [ˈbɒʔo], **butter** [ˈbʌʔə]

3. Flapping:
   In North American English, /t/ and /d/ often become a flap [ɾ] between vowels, especially when the second vowel is unstressed.

   - British pronunciation: **butter** [ˈbʌtə], **medal** [ˈmɛdl]
   - American pronunciation: **butter** [ˈbʌɾər], **medal** [ˈmɛɾl]

4. Yod-dropping:
   Some varieties drop the /j/ sound after certain consonants, particularly /t/, /d/, /n/.

   - RP: **news** [njuːz], **tune** [tjuːn], **dune** [djuːn]
   - General American: **news** [nuːz], **tune** [tuːn], **dune** [duːn]

5. H-dropping:
   In some British dialects, particularly working-class accents, the /h/ sound is often dropped at the beginning of words.

   - Standard: **house** [haʊs], **happy** [ˈhæpi]
   - H-dropping dialects: **'ouse** [aʊs], **'appy** [ˈæpi]

6. Th-fronting:
   In some dialects, particularly Cockney and other urban British accents, /θ/ and /ð/ are replaced with /f/ and /v/ respectively.

   - Standard: **think** [θɪŋk], **this** [ðɪs]
   - Th-fronting: **fink** [fɪŋk], **vis** [vɪs]

7. L-vocalization:
   In some accents, particularly in South-East England and Australia, final /l/ is vocalized to a vowel or semivowel.

   - Standard: **milk** [mɪlk], **bottle** [ˈbɒtl]
   - L-vocalizing: **milk** [mɪok], **bottle** [ˈbɒto]

### Prosodic Features

1. Stress-timed vs. Syllable-timed Rhythm:
   English is generally considered a stress-timed language, where stressed syllables occur at roughly regular intervals. However, some varieties (e.g., Singapore English, Indian English) tend towards a more syllable-timed rhythm.

2. Intonation Patterns:
   Different varieties of English can have distinct intonation patterns:

   - Rising intonation in statements (common in Australian and New Zealand English)
   - Use of high rising terminals in Valley Girl speech

3. Stress Placement:
   While stress placement is largely consistent across varieties, there are some differences:

   - British English: **con**troversy, **ad**dress (noun)
   - American English: con**tro**versy, ad**dress** (noun)

## Grammar

While the core grammar of English is largely consistent across varieties, there are several notable differences:

1. Use of Tenses:
   - Present Perfect vs. Simple Past:
     British English often uses the Present Perfect for recent actions, while American English tends to use the Simple Past more frequently.

     BrE: **"I've just eaten."**
     AmE: **"I just ate."**

   - Use of progressive forms:
     Indian English and some other varieties use the progressive aspect with stative verbs more readily than other varieties.

     Standard: **"I know him."**
     Indian English: **"I am knowing him."**

2. Verbal Paradigms:
   - Irregular Verbs:
     Some verbs have different past tense or past participle forms in different varieties.

     BrE: **"I've learnt a lot."** / **"The program was broadcast yesterday."**
     AmE: **"I've learned a lot."** / **"The program was broadcasted yesterday."**

   - Transitivity:
     Some verbs are transitive in some varieties but intransitive in others.

     BrE: **"The team are training hard."**
     AmE: **"The coach is training the team hard."**

3. Agreement:
   - Collective Nouns:
     British English often treats collective nouns as plural, while American English typically treats them as singular.

     BrE: **"The team are playing well."**
     AmE: **"The team is playing well."**

   - Notional Agreement:
     In some cases, notional (semantic) agreement overrides grammatical agreement in British English more readily than in American English.

     BrE: **"The government have decided."** (treating 'government' as a group of people)
     AmE: **"The government has decided."** (treating 'government' as a single entity)

4. Syntax:
   - Tag Questions:
     More common in British English than in American English. Indian English often uses a single invariant tag "isn't it?"

     BrE: **"It's cold, isn't it?"**
     AmE might prefer: **"It's cold, right?"**
     Indian English: **"You're going home, isn't it?"**

   - Preposition Stranding:
     While accepted in most varieties, it's more stigmatized in some.

     Informal: **"Who did you go with?"**
     Formal: **"With whom did you go?"**

5. Modality:
   - Subjunctive Mood:
     More commonly used in American English.

     AmE: **"I suggest that he go home."**
     BrE might prefer: **"I suggest that he goes home."**

   - Modal Verbs:
     Some varieties use modal combinations not found in standard varieties.

     Scottish English: **"I might could do that."** (meaning "I might be able to do that")

6. Negation:
   - Multiple Negation:
     Standard varieties typically avoid multiple negation, but it's common in many non-standard dialects.

     Standard: **"I don't have any."**
     AAVE: **"I don't have none."**

   - Negative Concord:
     In some varieties, negative concord (the use of multiple negative markers to express a single negation) is standard.

     Standard: **"I didn't see anybody."**
     Non-standard: **"I didn't see nobody."**

7. Pronouns:
   - Second Person Plural:
     Many varieties have developed distinct second person plural pronouns.

     Standard: **"you"** (singular and plural)
     Southern US: **"y'all"**
     Scots/Northern English: **"youse"**
     African American Vernacular English: **"y'all"** or **"you all"**

   - Gender-Neutral Pronouns:
     Some varieties, particularly in certain social contexts, use "they" as a singular gender-neutral pronoun more readily.

     **"Each student should bring their own lunch."**

8. Auxiliaries:
   - Do-support:
     In some Scottish and Irish varieties, do-support is used in affirmative statements for emphasis.

     **"I do be working every day."** (meaning "I work every day habitually")

   - Aspect:
     Some varieties have developed additional aspectual distinctions.

     Irish English: **"I'm after eating."** (meaning "I have just eaten")

9. Word Order:
   - Indirect Questions:
     In some varieties, the word order of indirect questions mirrors that of direct questions.

     Standard: **"I wonder what time it is."**
     Non-standard: **"I wonder what time is it."**

These grammatical features contribute significantly to the distinctiveness of various English dialects and can sometimes lead to misunderstandings between speakers of different varieties. Understanding these differences is crucial for effective communication in a global context where English serves as a lingua franca.
