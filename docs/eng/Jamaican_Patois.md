# Jamaican Patois

Jamaican Patois, also known as Jamaican Creole or simply Patois (Patwa in Patois), is an English-based creole language spoken primarily in Jamaica. It combines elements of English with influences from West African languages, particularly those of the Akan and Igbo peoples. Patois is the primary spoken language for most Jamaicans, while Standard English remains the official language used in formal settings.

## Phonology

Jamaican Patois has a distinct sound system that differs from Standard English in several ways.

### Vowels

Jamaican Patois has a simpler vowel system compared to Standard English:

| Patois Sound | IPA | Example |
|--------------|-----|---------|
| a | /a/ | **hat** (hot) |
| e | /ɛ/ | **ben** (bend) |
| i | /i/ | **wi** (we) |
| o | /ɔ/ | **kot** (coat) |
| u | /u/ | **luk** (look) |

Additionally, Patois has several diphthongs:

| Diphthong | IPA | Example |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| ai | /ai/ | **bwai** (boy) |
| ou | /ou/ | **bout** (about) |
| ie | /iɛ/ | **tief** (thief) |
| uo | /uɔ/ | **guot** (goat) |

### Consonants

Most consonants in Patois are similar to those in English, with a few notable differences:

| Patois Sound | IPA | Example |
|--------------|-----|---------|
| th | /t/ | **tink** (think) |
| th (voiced) | /d/ | **dat** (that) |
| ng | /ŋg/ | **singin** (singing) |
| ch | /tʃ/ | **chuch** (church) |
| j | /dʒ/ | **jraiv** (drive) |
| kya | /kja/ | **kyaan** (can’t) |
| nya | /nja/ | **nyam** (eat) |

### Stress and Intonation

Stress in Jamaican Patois typically falls on the first syllable of words, unlike Standard English where stress patterns can vary. For example:

- **BAH-na-na** (banana)
- **KA-ri-bee-an** (Caribbean)
- **JA-mai-ka** (Jamaica)

Intonation in Patois plays a crucial role in conveying meaning, especially in questions and emphatic statements. Rising intonation is often used for yes/no questions:

- **Yu a kom?** ↗️ (Are you coming?)

Falling intonation is used for statements and wh-questions:

- **Mi naa go deh** ↘️ (I'm not going there)
- **Weh yu a go?** ↘️ (Where are you going?)

### Sound Changes

Several common sound changes occur in Patois:

1. Consonant cluster reduction:
   - **stan** (stand)
   - **lef** (left)
   - **pos** (post)

2. Final consonant deletion:
   - **han** (hand)
   - **roa** (road)
   - **buk** (book)

3. Vowel changes:
   - /ɛ/ becomes /a/ before /r/: **faar** (fair)
   - /ɔ/ becomes /a/ in some words: **gaad** (God)
   - /ʌ/ becomes /ɔ/: **kot** (cut)

4. Palatalization:
   - /k/ becomes /kj/ before /a/: **kyar** (car)
   - /g/ becomes /gj/ before /a/: **gyadn** (garden)

5. H-dropping and hypercorrection:
   - **ouse** (house)
   - **happle** (apple) - hypercorrection

6. Metathesis:
   - **aks** (ask)
   - **wasp** (wasp)

## Grammar

Jamaican Patois grammar differs significantly from Standard English in many aspects.

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Patois do not change form based on case:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **mi** | **wi** |
| 2nd | **yu** | **unu** |
| 3rd | **im** (m), **shi** (f), **it** (n) | **dem** |

Examples:
- **Mi naa go** (I'm not going)
- **Yu si im?** (Do you see him/her?)

Possessive pronouns:

Double negatives are common and used for emphasis:

### Questions

Questions are often formed by intonation alone, without changing word order:

- **Yu waant som?** (Do you want some?)

Wh-questions use question words at the beginning of the sentence:

- **Wa mek yu du dat?** (Why did you do that?)
- **Wen yu a kom?** (When are you coming?)
- **Uu dat?** (Who is that?)
- **Wich wan yu waant?** (Which one do you want?)

### Plural Marking

Plural nouns are often unmarked or indicated by **dem**:

- **Tu buk** (Two books)

Some nouns have irregular plurals:

- **pikni** (child) → **pikni dem** (children)
- **uman** (woman) → **uman dem** (women)

### Possession

Possession is indicated by word order or the use of **fi**:

- **Jan buk** (John's book)
- **Di buk fi Jan** (The book of John's)

### Articles

- **Wan uman** (A woman)

The definite article is often omitted when the noun is understood to be specific:

## Syntax

Jamaican Patois syntax shares some similarities with English but has several distinct features.

### Word Order

The basic word order in Patois is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), similar to English:

- **Di bwai a iit di mango** (The boy is eating the mango)
- **Shi wash di kluoz dem** (She washed the clothes)

However, topicalization is common, where the object is moved to the beginning of the sentence for emphasis:

- **Di mango, di bwai a iit it** (The mango, the boy is eating it)
- **Dat buk deh, mi neva riid it** (That book there, I never read it)

### Serial Verb Constructions

Patois frequently uses serial verb constructions, where two or more verbs are used in sequence without conjunctions:

- **Tek di buk gi mi** (Take the book and give it to me)
- **Kom go nuo** (Come and go now)
- **Run go ketch im** (Run and catch him)
- **Kaal tel im fi kom** (Call and tell him to come)

### Topic-Comment Structure

Patois often uses a topic-comment structure, where the topic is stated first, followed by a comment about it:

- **Di mango, it swiit** (The mango, it's sweet)
- **Jan, im naa kom** (John, he's not coming)
- **Dat uman deh, shi nuo ow fi kuk** (That woman there, she knows how to cook)

### Copula

The copula (“to be”) is often omitted in Patois:

- **Im sick** (He is sick)
- **Di dog big** (The dog is big)
- **Mi tiiyad** (I'm tired)

However, **a** is used as a copula in some constructions:

- **Im a mi breda** (He is my brother)
- **Dat a di buk** (That is the book)
- **A so it go** (That's how it goes)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Patois are often introduced by **we** or **weh**:

- **Di gyal we yu si** (The girl whom you saw)
- **Di ous weh bun doun** (The house that burned down)
- **Di man we liv deh** (The man who lives there)

Sometimes, the relative pronoun is omitted entirely:

- **Di bwai mi tel yu bout** (The boy I told you about)

### Coordination

Coordination in Patois is similar to English, using conjunctions like **an** (and), **but**, and **or**:

- **Mi an yu a fren** (You and I are friends)
- **Im waant fi go, but im kyaan** (He wants to go, but he can’t)
- **Yu waant tiiti or kofi?** (Do you want tea or coffee?)

### Subordination

Subordinate clauses in Patois are often introduced by words like **if**, **bikaaz** (because), **wen** (when), and **so dat** (so that):

- **If yu kom, kaal mi** (If you come, call me)
- **Mi naa go bikaaz mi sick** (I'm not going because I'm sick)
- **Wen yu riich, tel mi** (When you arrive, tell me)
- **Mi a wok aad so dat mi pikni dem kyaan go a gud skuul** (I'm working hard so that my children can go to a good school)

## Phonological Processes

Several phonological processes are common in Jamaican Patois:

### Metathesis

Metathesis involves the reordering of sounds within a word:

- **aks** (ask)
- **pudden** (pudding)
- **preskripshan** (prescription)
- **kumfatable** (comfortable)

### Epenthesis

Epenthesis is the insertion of a sound within a word:

- **filem** (film)
- **gowl** (goal)
- **aiyelan** (island)
- **umberela** (umbrella)

### Aphaeresis

Aphaeresis is the loss of an initial sound:

- **bout** (about)
- **pon** (upon)
- **way** (away)
- **mongst** (amongst)

### Syncope

Syncope is the loss of a medial sound:

- **evry** (every)
- **difrent** (different)
- **vegtable** (vegetable)
- **intrestin** (interesting)

### Apocope

Apocope is the loss of a final sound:

- **las** (last)
- **mos** (most)
- **lef** (left)
- **jus** (just)

### Assimilation

Assimilation occurs when one sound becomes more like a neighboring sound:

- **im bin** → **im min** (he/she has been)
- **gud nait** → **gun nait** (good night)

## Code-Switching and Diglossia

Jamaican speakers often engage in code-switching between Patois and Standard English, depending on the social context. This results in a continuum of speech varieties:

1. Basilect: The “deepest” form of Patois, furthest from Standard English
2. Mesolect: An intermediate variety
3. Acrolect: The variety closest to Standard English

Example of the continuum:
- Basilect: **Mi naa nyam dat** (I'm not eating that)
- Mesolect: **Mi nat iiting dat** (I'm not eating that)
- Acrolect: **I'm not eating that**

Code-switching can occur within a single conversation or even within a single sentence:

- **Mi go a di maakit an den I went to the library** (I went to the market and then I went to the library)

Diglossia in Jamaica is characterized by the use of Patois in informal settings and Standard English in formal settings. This linguistic situation creates a complex interplay between the two varieties, with speakers often moving along the continuum depending on the context.

## Orthography

There is no standardized spelling system for Jamaican Patois. However, several proposed systems exist, including the Cassidy-JLU system and the Jamaican Writing System. Here are some general principles often used:

1. Phonetic spelling: Words are often spelled as they sound
   - **kom** (come)
   - **nuo** (know)
   - **waan** (want)
   - **ier** (hear)

2. Use of 'y' for the /j/ sound:
   - **yaad** (yard)
   - **yuh** (you)
   - **yelo** (yellow)
   - **nyam** (eat)

3. Doubling of vowels to indicate length:
   - **wiik** (week)
   - **fuud** (food)
   - **ruod** (road)
   - **biitn** (beaten)

4. Use of 'h' to indicate aspiration:
   - **hat** (hot)
   - **huol** (hole)
   - **hamp** (amp)
   - **hed** (head)

5. Representation of the /ŋ/ sound:
   - **singin** (singing)
   - **tinking** (thinking)
   - **rang** (wrong)

6. Use of 'kya', 'gya' for palatalized /k/ and /g/:
   - **kyar** (car)
   - **gyaadn** (garden)
   - **kyaat** (cart)

7. Representation of the /ʃ/ and /tʃ/ sounds:
   - **shi** (she)
   - **mash** (mash)
   - **chuch** (church)
   - **chooz** (choose)

Despite these general principles, spelling in Patois can vary widely depending on the writer and the intended audience. Some writers may choose spellings that more closely resemble Standard English, while others may opt for more phonetic representations.
