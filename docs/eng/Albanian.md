# Albanian

Albanian (shqip) is an Indo-European language spoken by approximately 7.5 million people, primarily in Albania, Kosovo, and North Macedonia, with significant diaspora communities worldwide. It forms its own branch within the Indo-European language family, having no close relatives. Albanian has two main dialects: Gheg (spoken in northern Albania and Kosovo) and Tosk (spoken in southern Albania), with the standard language based primarily on Tosk.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Albanian uses a Latin-based alphabet with 36 letters, including seven vowels and 29 consonants. The pronunciation is generally consistent with the spelling, making it relatively easy for learners to read once they've mastered the alphabet.

### Vowels

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
**a** | [a]
**e** | [ɛ]
**ë** | [ə]
**i** | [i]
**o** | [ɔ]
**u** | [u]
**y** | [y]

### Consonants

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
**b** | [b]
**c** | [ts]
**ç** | [tʃ]
**d** | [d]
**dh** | [ð]
**f** | [f]
**g** | [ɡ]
**gj** | [ɟ]
**h** | [h]
**j** | [j]
**k** | [k]
**l** | [l]
**ll** | [ɫ]
**m** | [m]
**n** | [n]
**nj** | [ɲ]
**p** | [p]
**q** | [c]
**r** | [ɾ]
**rr** | [r]
**s** | [s]
**sh** | [ʃ]
**t** | [t]
**th** | [θ]
**v** | [v]
**x** | [dz]
**xh** | [dʒ]
**z** | [z]
**zh** | [ʒ]

### Stress

In Albanian, stress is generally on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable. However, there are exceptions:

1. Many words ending in **-ë** have stress on the third-to-last syllable: **mësues** [mə'suːɛs] ('teacher')
2. Some words, especially those of foreign origin, may have stress on the last syllable: **televizor** [tɛlɛvi'zɔɾ] ('television')

### Sound changes and assimilation

Albanian has several phonological processes that affect pronunciation:

1. Final devoicing: Voiced consonants at the end of words are often devoiced. For example, **gjuhë** ('language') is pronounced more like [ɟu'hə̥] with a devoiced final vowel.

2. Nasal assimilation: Before velar consonants, **n** is pronounced as [ŋ]. For example, **ankth** ('anxiety') is pronounced [aŋkθ].

3. Palatalization: Certain consonants become palatalized before front vowels. For example, **ke** ('you have') is pronounced [cɛ] rather than [kɛ].

## Morphology

Albanian has a complex morphological system with numerous inflections for nouns, adjectives, and verbs.

### Nouns

Albanian nouns have several grammatical categories:

1. Gender: masculine or feminine
2. Number: singular or plural
3. Case: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative
4. Definiteness: definite or indefinite

Here's an example of how a noun changes based on these categories:

| Case | Indefinite Singular | Definite Singular | Indefinite Plural | Definite Plural |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Nominative | **libër** ('book') | **libri** | **libra** | **librat** |
| Accusative | **libër** | **librin** | **libra** | **librat** |
| Genitive | **libri** | **librit** | **librash** | **librave** |
| Dative | **libri** | **librit** | **librash** | **librave** |
| Ablative | **libri** | **librit** | **librash** | **librave** |

Note that the genitive, dative, and ablative forms are identical in modern Albanian, though they were historically distinct.

Gender in Albanian is not always predictable from the form of the noun, but there are some patterns:

- Most nouns ending in **-ë** are feminine: **shtëpi** ('house'), **punë** ('work')
- Most nouns ending in consonants are masculine: **mal** ('mountain'), **vend** ('place')

Plural formation in Albanian can be complex, with several patterns:

1. Adding **-a**: **libër** → **libra** ('book' → 'books')
2. Adding **-e**: **det** → **dete** ('sea' → 'seas')
3. Adding **-ë**: **mik** → **miqë** ('friend' → 'friends')
4. Changing the stem: **njeri** → **njerëz** ('person' → 'people')

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Albanian agree with the nouns they modify in gender, number, and case. They also have definite and indefinite forms. Most adjectives follow the noun they modify.

Example with **i madh** ('big'):

| Gender | Indefinite Singular | Definite Singular | Indefinite Plural | Definite Plural |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Masculine | **qytet i madh** | **qyteti i madh** | **qytete të mëdhenj** | **qytetet e mëdhenj** |
| Feminine | **shtëpi e madhe** | **shtëpia e madhe** | **shtëpi të mëdha** | **shtëpitë e mëdha** |

Note the use of articles (**i**, **e**, **të**) before adjectives, which change based on the gender and number of the noun.

### Pronouns

Albanian has several types of pronouns:

1. Personal pronouns
2. Possessive pronouns
3. Demonstrative pronouns
4. Relative pronouns
5. Interrogative pronouns

Personal pronouns have full and short forms. The short forms are used as direct and indirect objects and are attached to the verb.

Full personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **unë** | **ne** |
| 2nd | **ti** | **ju** |
| 3rd (m/f) | **ai** / **ajo** | **ata** / **ato** |

Short form (clitic) pronouns for direct objects:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **më** | **na** |
| 2nd | **të** | **ju** |
| 3rd (m/f) | **e** / **e** | **i** / **i** |

Example: **Ai më pa** ('He saw me')

Possessive pronouns agree with the possessed noun in gender, number, and case:

| Person | Masculine Singular | Feminine Singular | Plural |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1st sg. | **im** | **ime** | **e mi** / **e mia** |
| 2nd sg. | **yt** | **jote** | **e tu** / **e tua** |
| 3rd sg. (m/f) | **i tij** / **e saj** | **e tij** / **e saj** | **e tij** / **e saj** |
| 1st pl. | **ynë** | **jonë** | **tanë** |
| 2nd pl. | **juaj** | **juaj** | **tuaj** |
| 3rd pl. (m/f) | **i tyre** | **e tyre** | **e tyre** |

Example: **libri im** ('my book'), **shtëpia ime** ('my house')

Demonstrative pronouns:

- **ky** / **kjo** ('this' m/f)
- **ai** / **ajo** ('that' m/f)

Example: **Ky libër është interesant** ('This book is interesting')

### Verbs

Albanian verbs are highly inflected, showing tense, mood, aspect, voice, person, and number. The language has six moods:

1. Indicative
2. Subjunctive
3. Conditional
4. Admirative
5. Imperative
6. Optative

And several tenses:

1. Present
2. Imperfect
3. Perfect
4. Pluperfect
5. Future
6. Future Perfect

Here's an example conjugation of the verb **punoj** ('to work') in the present indicative:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **punoj** | **punojmë** |
| 2nd | **punon** | **punoni** |
| 3rd | **punon** | **punojnë** |

The past tense in Albanian is formed using the perfect, which consists of an auxiliary verb (**kam** 'have' or **jam** 'be') and the past participle:

**Kam punuar** ('I have worked')
**Jam larguar** ('I have left')

The future tense is formed using the particle **do** followed by the subjunctive:

**do të punoj** ('I will work')

Albanian also has an unusual mood called the admirative, which is used to express surprise or doubt:

**Ai punuaka shumë!** ('He works a lot!' - expressing surprise)

### Particles and clitics

Albanian makes extensive use of particles and clitics, small words that attach to other words or phrases. Some important ones include:

- **të**: used in the subjunctive and with adjectives
- **u**: reflexive/passive marker
- **po**: progressive aspect marker

Example: **Po punoj** ('I am working')

## Syntax

Albanian follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, but it's relatively flexible due to its case system. 

### Basic sentence structure

A simple Albanian sentence might look like this:

**Djali lexon një libër.** ('The boy reads a book.')

However, for emphasis or stylistic reasons, other orders are possible:

**Një libër lexon djali.** ('It's a book that the boy is reading.')

### Questions

Questions can be formed by changing the intonation of a statement or by using interrogative words:

- **A punon ti?** ('Do you work?')
- **Ku punon ti?** ('Where do you work?')

### Negation

Negation is formed by placing **nuk** (or **s'** in colloquial speech) before the verb:

**Nuk punoj sot.** ('I don’t work today.')

### Compound sentences

Coordinating conjunctions like **dhe** ('and'), **por** ('but'), **ose** ('or') are used to join clauses:

**Ai punon dhe ajo studion.** ('He works and she studies.')

### Subordinate clauses

Subordinating conjunctions introduce dependent clauses:

**Mendoj se ai do të vijë.** ('I think that he will come.')

### Case usage

The case system in Albanian allows for flexible word order while maintaining clear grammatical relationships. Here are some common uses of cases:

1. Nominative: Used for the subject of a sentence.
   **Vajza këndoi.** ('The girl sang.')

2. Accusative: Used for the direct object.
   **Pashë vajzën.** ('I saw the girl.')

3. Genitive: Expresses possession and is formed with the particle **i/e/të/së** before the noun.
   **Libri i vajzës** ('The girl's book')

4. Dative: Used for the indirect object.
   **I dhashë vajzës një libër.** ('I gave the girl a book.')

5. Ablative: Used with certain prepositions and to express the means by which an action is performed.
   **Shkova me makinë.** ('I went by car.')

### Clitic placement

Object pronouns in their clitic form usually precede the verb:

**E pashë atë.** ('I saw him/her.')

In compound tenses, they can attach to the auxiliary:

**E kam parë atë.** ('I have seen him/her.')

### Definiteness

Albanian uses both definite and indefinite articles, but unlike many European languages, the definite article is postposed (added to the end of the noun):

**libër** ('a book') → **libri** ('the book')

## Lexicon

Albanian vocabulary is primarily of native Indo-European stock, but it has also borrowed from other languages throughout its history. Some common sources of loanwords include:

1. Latin: Often in administrative, religious, or scientific terms
   Example: **shkollë** ('school') from Latin “schola”

2. Greek: Especially in religious and philosophical terms
   Example: **kishë** ('church') from Greek “ekklesia”

3. Turkish: Due to centuries of Ottoman rule
   Example: **çaj** ('tea') from Turkish “çay”

4. Italian: Particularly in areas of culture and modern life
   Example: **apartament** ('apartment') from Italian “appartamento”

5. Slavic languages: Due to geographic proximity
   Example: **porosit** ('to order') from Slavic “poračati”

6. English: Especially in technology and contemporary culture
   Example: **kompjuter** ('computer')

Despite these influences, Albanian has maintained a significant portion of native vocabulary, including many words that can be traced back to Proto-Indo-European roots.

### Word formation

Albanian has several productive methods of word formation:

1. Prefixation: Adding prefixes to change or modify meaning
   **punë** ('work') → **papunë** ('unemployment')

2. Suffixation: Adding suffixes to change part of speech or meaning
   **punë** ('work') → **punëtor** ('worker')

3. Compounding: Combining two or more words
   **kryeqytet** ('capital city') from **krye** ('head') + **qytet** ('city')

### Idioms and expressions

Albanian has many idiomatic expressions that may not translate directly to other languages:

**Më hëngri koka** (lit. 'My head ate me') - meaning 'I'm in big trouble'

**I ra në qafë** (lit. 'It fell on his neck') - meaning 'To bother someone persistently'

## Dialects

Albanian has two main dialect groups: Gheg and Tosk. The Shkumbin River in central Albania roughly forms the boundary between these dialects.

### Gheg

Spoken in northern Albania, Kosovo, and parts of North Macedonia. Some features of Gheg include:

1. Nasal vowels: **zã** [zɒ̃] ('voice') compared to Tosk **zë** [zə]
2. Retention of intervocalic /n/: **venë** ('wine') compared to Tosk **verë**
3. Different infinitive form: **me punue** compared to Tosk **për të punuar** ('to work')

### Tosk

Spoken in southern Albania and the basis for standard Albanian. Some features of Tosk include:

1. Rhotacism of intervocalic /n/: **verë** ('wine') compared to Gheg **venë**
2. No nasal vowels
3. Use of admirative forms ending in **-ka**: **punuaka** ('he/she works', expressing surprise)

## Colloquial Albanian

Colloquial Albanian, especially in urban areas, can differ significantly from the standard language. Some features of colloquial speech include:

1. Contraction of common phrases:
   **s'kam** instead of **nuk kam** ('I don’t have')

2. Use of loanwords, especially from English in youth speech:
   **OK** instead of **mirë** ('okay')

3. Omission of cases in certain contexts:
   **Fola me Agim** instead of **Fola me Agimin** ('I spoke with Agim')

4. Use of discourse particles:
   **Ça bën, mo?** ('What are you doing?', where **mo** is a friendly particle)
   **Hajde, pra!** ('Come on, then!', where **pra** emphasizes the request)

5. Shortened verb forms in spoken language:
   **Po vij** instead of **Po vij tani** ('I'm coming now')

6. More frequent use of Turkish loanwords:
   **hallall** ('well-deserved') instead of the more formal **të qoftë** ('may it be yours')

## Phonological processes

Albanian exhibits several interesting phonological processes:

1. Vowel alternation: In some words, vowels change in different grammatical forms:
   **dash** ('ram') → **desh** ('rams')
   **plak** ('old man') → **pleq** ('old men')

2. Consonant palatalization: Certain consonants become palatalized before front vowels:
   **gjak** [ɟak] ('blood') → **gjaku** [ɟaku] ('the blood')

3. L-vocalization: In some dialects, especially Gheg, /l/ can become [w] in certain positions:
   Standard **baltë** ('mud') → Gheg [bawtə]

4. Assimilation: Consonants often assimilate to surrounding sounds:
   **në Shqipëri** ('in Albania') is often pronounced [nʃːipəɾi]

## Verbal system

The Albanian verbal system is complex and nuanced. Here are some additional details:

1. Aspect: Albanian verbs can express perfective and imperfective aspects, often through different verb forms:
   **Lexoj** ('I read', imperfective) vs. **Lexova** ('I read', perfective)

2. Voice: Active and passive voices are distinguished:
   **Unë hap derën** ('I open the door', active)
   **Dera hapet** ('The door is opened', passive)

3. Mood: The subjunctive mood is widely used, often in contexts where English would use an infinitive:
   **Dua të shkoj** ('I want to go', lit. 'I want that I go')

4. Admirative mood: This unique mood expresses surprise or newfound information:
   **Ai qenka këtu!** ('He's here!' - expressing surprise at this discovery)

5. Optative mood: Used for wishes and curses:
   **Rroftë Shqipëria!** ('Long live Albania!')

6. Gerund: Formed with **duke** + participle:
   **Duke punuar** ('while working')

## Noun system

More details on the Albanian noun system:

1. Neuter gender: While mostly obsolete, some neuter nouns still exist:
   **ujë** ('water'), **mish** ('meat')

2. Collective nouns: Some nouns have special collective forms:
   **gjethe** ('leaf') → **gjethja** ('foliage')

3. Abstract nouns: Often formed with suffixes like **-i**, **-ësi**, **-im**:
   **mik** ('friend') → **miqësi** ('friendship')
   **punë** ('work') → **punim** ('work, essay')

4. Diminutives: Formed with suffixes like **-th**, **-z**, **-kë**:
   **vajzë** ('girl') → **vajzëz** ('little girl')

## Adjective system

More on Albanian adjectives:

1. Comparison: Comparative and superlative forms are usually analytical:
   **i madh** ('big') → **më i madh** ('bigger') → **më i madhi** ('biggest')

2. Adjectival nouns: Some adjectives can be used as nouns:
   **i riu** ('the young one', from **i ri** 'young')

3. Participles as adjectives: Both present and past participles can function as adjectives:
   **ujë i vluar** ('boiling water', lit. 'water boiled')

## Adverbs

Albanian adverbs can be formed in several ways:

1. From adjectives, using the neuter form:
   **i shpejtë** ('quick') → **shpejt** ('quickly')

2. With the suffix **-isht**:
   **shqip** ('Albanian') → **shqiptarisht** ('in Albanian')

3. From nouns with the preposition **me**:
   **me kujdes** ('carefully', lit. 'with care')

## Numerals

Albanian has a vigesimal (base-20) counting system for some numbers:
**njëzet** ('twenty', lit. 'one twenty')
**njëzet e një** ('twenty-one', lit. 'one twenty and one')
**dyzetë** ('forty', lit. 'two twenties')

Ordinal numbers are formed with the prefix **i/e/të** and the suffix **-të**:
**i parë** ('first'), **i dytë** ('second'), **i tretë** ('third')

## Word order and information structure

While Albanian generally follows SVO order, it allows for considerable flexibility for emphasis or stylistic reasons:

1. Topicalization: Moving an element to the front of the sentence for emphasis:
   **Librin e lexova** ('The book, I read it')

2. Clitic doubling: Using both a full noun phrase and a clitic pronoun:
   **Agimin e pashë dje** ('Agim, I saw him yesterday')

3. Focus constructions: Using cleft or pseudo-cleft sentences:
   **Ishte Agroni që erdhi** ('It was Agron who came')

## Conjunctions and connectives

Albanian has a rich system of conjunctions and connectives:

1. Coordinating: **dhe** ('and'), **por** ('but'), **ose** ('or')
2. Subordinating: **që** ('that'), **sepse** ('because'), **meqë** ('since')
3. Correlative: **jo vetëm... por edhe** ('not only... but also')
4. Discourse markers: **prandaj** ('therefore'), **megjithatë** ('however')

## Politeness and formality

Albanian distinguishes between formal and informal address:

1. Informal: Using **ti** ('you' singular) and corresponding verb forms
2. Formal: Using **Ju** ('you' plural, but used for formal singular) and corresponding verb forms

Formal titles are often used with names:
**Zoti Hoxha** ('Mr. Hoxha'), **Zonja Shehu** ('Mrs. Shehu')

## Loan translations and calques

Albanian has many calques, especially from Turkish and Italian:
**pikëpamje** ('point of view', calque of German 'Standpunkt')
**marrëdhënie** ('relationship', calque of Italian 'relazione')

## Orthography

Albanian orthography is largely phonemic, but there are some points to note:

1. The letter **ë** often becomes silent at the end of words in speech, but is always written
2. The digraphs **dh**, **th**, **xh**, **sh**, **zh** represent single sounds
3. Stress is not usually marked, except in some minimal pairs: **súlltan** ('sultan') vs **sulltán** ('their plum')

## Onomatopoeia

Albanian has many colorful onomatopoeic words:
**bam-bam** (sound of gunfire)
**fër-fër** (rustling sound)

## Interjections

Albanian uses various interjections for different emotions:
**Uf!** (expressing exhaustion or annoyance)
**Aman!** (expressing exasperation or pleading)
