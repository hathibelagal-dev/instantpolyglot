# Occitan

Occitan is a Romance language historically spoken in southern France, Monaco, parts of Italy, and Spain's Val d'Aran. It is closely related to Catalan and more distantly to French and Spanish. The language has several dialects, including Provençal, Languedocien, Gascon, Auvergnat, Limousin, and Vivaro-Alpine.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Occitan uses the Latin alphabet with some additional characters. The pronunciation can vary between dialects, but here are the general rules:

### Vowels

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| a | [a] |
| e | [e], [ɛ] |
| i | [i] |
| o | [u], [ɔ] |
| u | [y] |

### Consonants

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| c | [k] before a, o, u; [s] before e, i |
| ç | [s] |
| ch | [tʃ] |
| g | [g] before a, o, u; [dʒ] before e, i |
| h | silent |
| j | [dʒ] |
| lh | [ʎ] |
| nh | [ɲ] |
| qu | [k] |
| r | [r] or [ʁ] |
| s | [s], [z] between vowels |
| v | [b] or [v] depending on dialect |
| x | [ks] |

### Stress

The stress in Occitan words generally falls on the last syllable, except when the word ends in a vowel, in which case it falls on the penultimate syllable.

Examples:
- **parlar** [paɾˈla] (to speak)
- **estudiant** [estydiˈan] (student)
- **musica** [ˈmyzikɔ] (music)

## Morphology

### Nouns

Occitan nouns have two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural). The plural is typically formed by adding -s to the singular form.

Examples:
- Masculine: **libre** (book), **libres** (books)
- Feminine: **taula** (table), **taulas** (tables)

Some nouns change their final vowel when forming the plural:

- **òme** (man), **òmes** (men)
- **bordalés** (person from Bordeaux), **bordaleses** (people from Bordeaux)

### Articles

Occitan has both definite and indefinite articles, which agree in gender and number with the noun they modify.

Or by using question words:

- **Quora arribas?** (When are you arriving?)

### Negation

Negation is formed by placing **non** before the verb:

In some dialects, a second negative particle **pas** is used after the verb:

- **Non parli pas anglés.** (I don’t speak English.)

### Compound tenses

Compound tenses are formed using the auxiliary verbs **aver** (to have) or **èsser** (to be) followed by the past participle:

- **Ai parlat.** (I have spoken.)
- **Soi arribat.** (I have arrived.)

### Reflexive verbs

Reflexive verbs use reflexive pronouns:

- **Se lavar** (to wash oneself)
- **Me lavi.** (I wash myself.)

### Passive voice

The passive voice is formed using the verb **èsser** (to be) and the past participle:
