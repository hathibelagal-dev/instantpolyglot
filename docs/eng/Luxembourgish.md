## Morphology

### Nouns

Luxembourgish nouns have three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. They are declined for case (nominative, accusative, dative) and number (singular, plural).

#### Gender

Some general rules for gender:

- Masculine: Most nouns ending in -er, -el, -en
  Example: **den Teller** (the plate), **de Schlëssel** (the key)

- Feminine: Most nouns ending in -heet, -keet, -ioun, -schaft
  Example: **d'Fräiheet** (freedom), **d'Natioun** (nation)

- Neuter: Most nouns ending in -chen (diminutives)
  Example: **d'Meedchen** (the girl), **d'Hënnchen** (the chicken)

#### Plural formation

There are several ways to form plurals in Luxembourgish:

1. Add -en
   **Buch** (book) → **Bicher** (books)
   **Kand** (child) → **Kanner** (children)

2. Add -er (often with umlaut)
   **Mann** (man) → **Männer** (men)
   **Haus** (house) → **Haiser** (houses)

3. No change (often with umlaut)

   **Dag** (day) → **Deeg** (days)
   **Staat** (city) → **Stied** (cities)

#### Case

Luxembourgish has three cases: nominative, accusative, and dative. The genitive case is rarely used and is typically replaced by prepositional constructions.

Example of case declension for **de Mann** (the man):

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nominative | **de Mann** | **d'Männer** |
| Accusative | **de Mann** | **d'Männer** |
| Dative | **dem Mann** | **de Männer** |

### Articles

Luxembourgish has definite and indefinite articles that agree with the noun's gender and case.

Definite articles:

| Gender | Nominative/Accusative | Dative |
|--------|------------------------|--------|
| Masculine | **de(n)** | **dem** |
| Feminine | **d'** | **der** |
| Neuter | **d'** | **dem** |
| Plural (all genders) | **d'** | **den** |

Indefinite articles:

| Gender | Nominative/Accusative | Dative |
|--------|------------------------|--------|
| Masculine | **e(n)** | **engem** |
| Feminine | **eng** | **enger** |
| Neuter | **en** | **engem** |

Example: 
**De Mann** (the man)
**Eng Fra** (a woman)
**En Haus** (a house)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Luxembourgish agree with the noun they modify in gender, number, and case. They also have different forms depending on whether they are used predicatively or attributively.

Predicative use (after the verb):
**Den Hond ass grouss.** (The dog is big.)

Attributive use (before the noun):
**De grousse Mann** (The big man)
**Déi grouss Fra** (The big woman)
**Dat grousst Haus** (The big house)

Comparative and superlative forms:

- Comparative: add -er
  **grouss** (big) → **méi grouss** (bigger)

- Superlative: add -st
  **grouss** (big) → **am gréissten** (biggest)

Irregular forms exist for some common adjectives:
**gutt** (good) → **besser** (better) → **am beschten** (best)
**vill** (much/many) → **méi** (more) → **am meeschten** (most)

### Verbs

Luxembourgish verbs conjugate for person, number, tense, and mood. The infinitive typically ends in -en.

#### Present tense

Simple past (rarely used in spoken language):
**Ech goung** (I went)

Compound past (more common):
**Ech sinn gaangen** (I have gone/I went)

#### Future tense

The future tense is formed using the auxiliary verb **wäerten** (will) + infinitive:

**Ech wäert goen** (I will go)

#### Conditional

The conditional is formed using **géif** (would) + infinitive:

**Ech géif goen** (I would go)

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed by using the stem of the verb:

**Gëff!** (Give!)
**Komm!** (Come!)

#### Participles

Present participle: add -end to the stem
**spillen** (to play) → **spillend** (playing)

Past participle: typically formed by adding ge- to the beginning and -t or -en to the end
**spillen** (to play) → **gespillt** (played)
**goen** (to go) → **gaangen** (gone)

#### Modal verbs

Luxembourgish has several modal verbs, including:

- **kënnen** (can/to be able to)
- **mussen** (must/to have to)
- **däerfen** (may/to be allowed to)
- **sollen** (should/ought to)
- **wëllen** (want to)

Example:
**Ech kann net kommen.** (I can't come.)
**Du muss elo goen.** (You must go now.)

## Syntax

### Word order

The basic word order in Luxembourgish is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):

**Ech iessen en Apel.** (I eat an apple.)

In subordinate clauses, the verb moves to the end:

**Ech weess, datt hien en Apel ësst.** (I know that he eats an apple.)

### Question formation

Yes/no questions are formed by inverting the subject and verb:

**Gees du an d'Schoul?** (Are you going to school?)

Wh-questions use interrogative words at the beginning of the sentence:

**Wou gees du?** (Where are you going?)

### Negation

Negation is typically formed using **net** (not):

**Ech ginn net an d'Schoul.** (I'm not going to school.)

Double negatives are not used in standard Luxembourgish.

### Compound verbs

Luxembourgish uses separable and inseparable prefixes similar to German:

Separable: **ufänken** (to begin)
**Ech fänken un.** (I begin.)

Inseparable: **verstoen** (to understand)
**Ech verstinn.** (I understand.)

### Passive voice

The passive voice is formed using the auxiliary verb **ginn** (to become) + past participle:

**D'Dier gëtt opgemaach.** (The door is being opened.)

   **alt** (just, used for softening statements)
   **majo** (well, used to start sentences)

Example:
Standard: **Ech hunn eppes gesinn.**
Colloquial: **Ech hunn alt eppes gesinn, jo.**

## Dialectal variations

While Luxembourgish is a relatively small language, it does have some regional variations. The main dialects are:

1. Veluws (North)
2. Mëttelzentrallëtzebuergesch (Central)
3. Minetter (South)

Some differences include:

- Pronunciation of 'r': The northern dialect tends to use a rolled 'r' [r], while the south uses a more guttural 'r' [ʁ].
- Vocabulary: Some words vary by region. For example, "potato" is **Gromper** in the south and **Äerdappel** in the north.

## Code-switching and multilingualism

Given Luxembourg's multilingual environment, code-switching is common in everyday speech. Luxembourgers often mix Luxembourgish with French or German:

**Ech gi muer an d'Ville faire du shopping.** 
(I'm going to the city to do some shopping tomorrow.)

Here, "Ville" (city) and "faire du shopping" (to go shopping) are French phrases inserted into a Luxembourgish sentence.

## Phonological processes

### Assimilation

Luxembourgish exhibits various forms of assimilation:

1. Voice assimilation:
   **Dag** [daːx] (day), but **gudde Dag** [ɡudə daːx] (good day)

2. Place assimilation:
   **am Bett** [ɑm bɛt] (in bed), but **am Pullover** [ɑm pulovɐ] (in the sweater)

### Elision

For unreal conditions, the Subjunctive II is used:

**Wann ech räich wier, géif ech en Haus kafen.**
(If I were rich, I would buy a house.)

## Verb prefixes

Luxembourgish, like German, makes extensive use of verb prefixes to modify meaning:

1. Separable prefixes:
   **opmaachen** (to open)
   **Ech maachen d'Dier op.** (I open the door.)

2. Inseparable prefixes:
   **verkafen** (to sell)
   **Ech verkafen mäin Auto.** (I'm selling my car.)

Some prefixes can be both separable and inseparable, changing the meaning:

**ëmgoen** (to associate with) - inseparable
**ëm|goen** (to go around) - separable

## Aspect and Aktionsart

While Luxembourgish doesn't have a fully developed aspect system like Slavic languages, it does use various means to express aspectual distinctions:

1. Periphrastic constructions:
   **Ech sinn am Liesen.** (I am reading.)

2. Adverbs:
   **Ech liesen grad.** (I'm reading right now.)

3. Prefixes:
   **Ech liesen de Buch.** (I'm reading the book.)
   **Ech liesen de Buch aus.** (I'm reading the book to the end.)

## Word formation

### Compounding

Luxembourgish, like other Germanic languages, readily forms compound words:

**Waasserfläsch** (water bottle) = **Waasser** (water) + **Fläsch** (bottle)
**Summervakanz** (summer vacation) = **Summer** (summer) + **Vakanz** (vacation)

### Diminutives

Diminutives are formed by adding -chen or -elchen:

**Kand** (child) → **Këndchen** (little child)
**Buch** (book) → **Bichelchen** (little book)

### Nominalization

Verbs can be nominalized by adding -en to the stem:

**schaffen** (to work) → **d'Schaffen** (the working)

## Luxembourgish in the digital age

Luxembourgish has adapted to the digital age with new vocabulary and expressions:

**Wéi een an de Bësch jäizt, esou jäizt et eraus.**
(As one shouts into the forest, so it shouts back - equivalent to "As you sow, so shall you reap")

## Politeness and formality

Luxembourgish distinguishes between formal and informal address:

Informal: **du** (you singular)
Formal: **Dir** (you singular/plural formal)

Example:
Informal: **Wéi geet et dir?** (How are you?)
Formal: **Wéi geet et Iech?** (How are you?)

## Interjections and exclamations

Luxembourgish has various interjections for different situations:

**Oj!** (Oh! - surprise)
**Aua!** (Ouch! - pain)
**Ups!** (Oops! - mistake)

## Spelling reforms

Luxembourgish spelling was standardized relatively recently. The most recent spelling reform was implemented in 1999, aiming to simplify and standardize the orthography.

## Language status and policy

Luxembourgish became the national language of Luxembourg in 1984. It is used alongside French and German in administration and education. 

## Conclusion

Luxembourgish, while a relatively small language, has a rich and complex structure that reflects its unique position at the crossroads of Germanic and Romance languages. Its grammar shares many features with German, while its vocabulary shows significant French influence. As Luxembourg continues to be a multilingual society, Luxembourgish maintains its important role as a marker of national identity while coexisting with other languages in daily life.
