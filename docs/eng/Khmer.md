# Khmer

Khmer, also known as Cambodian, is the official language of Cambodia and is spoken by approximately 16 million people. It is an Austroasiatic language, belonging to the Mon-Khmer subfamily. Khmer is the second most widely spoken Austroasiatic language after Vietnamese.

## Writing System

Khmer uses its own unique script, the Khmer script (អក្សរខ្មែរ, **aksar khmer**), which is an abugida derived from the Brahmi script of ancient India. The script is written from left to right.

### Consonants

Khmer consonants are divided into two series: 

1. A-series (ឧ, **o**)
2. O-series (ឱ, **oo**)

Each consonant inherently carries a vowel sound. A-series consonants carry an implicit “a” sound, while O-series consonants carry an implicit “o” sound.

Here are the basic consonants:

| Consonant | IPA | Romanization |
|-----------|-----|--------------|
| ក | k | k |
| ខ | kʰ | kh |
| គ | k | k |
| ឃ | kʰ | kh |
| ង | ŋ | ng |
| ច | c | ch |
| ឆ | cʰ | chh |
| ជ | c | ch |
| ឈ | cʰ | chh |
| ញ | ɲ | nh |
| ដ | ɗ | d |
| ឋ | tʰ | th |
| ឌ | ɗ | d |
| ឍ | tʰ | th |
| ណ | n | n |
| ត | t | t |
| ថ | tʰ | th |
| ទ | t | t |
| ធ | tʰ | th |
| ន | n | n |
| ប | ɓ | b |
| ផ | pʰ | ph |
| ព | p | p |
| ភ | pʰ | ph |
| ម | m | m |
| យ | j | y |

| ល | l | l |
| វ | ʋ | v |
| ស | s | s |
| ហ | h | h |
| ឡ | l | l |

### Vowels

Khmer has a complex system of vowels, with 23 vowel symbols that can represent up to 30 distinct vowel sounds. Here are some examples:

| Vowel | IPA | Romanization |
|-------|-----|--------------|
| ា | aː | aa |
| ិ | ɨ, i | e, i |
| ី | iː | ei |
| ឹ | ɨ | oe |
| ឺ | ɨː | eu |
| ុ | u | o, u |
| ូ | uː | ou |
| ួ | uə | ua |
| ើ | aə | ae |
| ឿ | ɨə | ue |
| ៀ | iə | ie |
| េ | eː | e |
| ែ | ae | ae |
| ៃ | aj | ai |
| ោ | ao | ao |
| ៅ | aw | au |
| ុំ | om | om |
| ំ | um | um |
| ាំ | am | am |

### Subscripts

Khmer also uses subscripts (ជើងអក្សរ, **cheung aksar**) to represent consonant clusters. For example:

- ក្រ = **kr**
- ស្ត = **st**
- ម្ល = **ml**

## Phonology

### Consonants

Khmer has a rich consonant inventory, including aspirated and unaspirated stops, as well as implosives.

| Manner | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Plosive | p pʰ ɓ | t tʰ ɗ | c cʰ | k kʰ | ʔ |
| Nasal | m | n | ɲ | ŋ | |
| Fricative | | s | | | h |
| Approximant | ʋ | l r | j | | |

### Vowels

Khmer has a complex vowel system with distinctions in length and quality:

| Front | Central | Back |
|-------|---------|------|
| i iː | ɨ ɨː | u uː |
| e eː | ə əː | o oː |
| ɛ ɛː | a aː | ɔ ɔː |

There are also several diphthongs, such as /iə/, /ɨə/, /uə/, /ae/, /ao/, /aə/.

### Tones

Unlike some of its neighbors (such as Vietnamese or Thai), Khmer is not a tonal language. However, it does have a register system that affects vowel quality and voice quality.

## Grammar

### Nouns

Khmer nouns do not inflect for number or gender. Plurality can be indicated by context, numeral classifiers, or by adding words like ពួក (**puak**, “group”) or ច្រើន (**craen**, “many”).

Examples:
- **សៀវភៅ** (/siəwpʰɨw/) - “book” or “books”
- **ពួកគេ** (/puək kee/) - “they” (literally “group they”)
- **សៀវភៅច្រើន** (/siəwpʰɨw craən/) - “many books”

### Pronouns

Khmer has a complex system of pronouns that reflect social relationships and levels of formality. Here are some common pronouns:

| Person | Informal | Formal | Polite |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1st singular | ខ្ញុំ (**khnom**) | ខ្ញុំបាទ (**khnom baat**, male)<br>ខ្ញុំម្ចាស់ (**khnom mchas**, female) | ខ្ញុំ (**khnom**) |
| 2nd singular | ឯង (**aeng**) | លោក (**look**, male)<br>អ្នក (**neak**, female) | លោក (**look**, male)<br>លោកស្រី (**look srey**, female) |
| 3rd singular | វា (**via**) | គាត់ (**koat**) | គេ (**ke**) |
| 1st plural | យើង (**yeung**) | យើងខ្ញុំ (**yeung khnom**) | ពួកយើង (**puak yeung**) |
| 2nd plural | ពួកឯង (**puak aeng**) | ពួកគាត់ (**puak koat**) | លោកទាំងឡាយ (**look teang laay**) |
| 3rd plural | ពួកវា (**puak via**) | ពួកគាត់ (**puak koat**) | ពួកគេ (**puak ke**) |

### Verbs

Khmer verbs do not conjugate for person, number, or tense. Tense and aspect are typically indicated by context or by using time words or auxiliary verbs.

Examples:
- **ខ្ញុំទៅផ្សារ** (/kʰɲom tɨw psar/) - “I go to the market” (present tense by context)
- **ខ្ញុំបានទៅផ្សារ** (/kʰɲom baan tɨw psar/) - “I went to the market” (past tense indicated by បាន /baan/)
- **ខ្ញុំនឹងទៅផ្សារ** (/kʰɲom nɨŋ tɨw psar/) - “I will go to the market” (future tense indicated by នឹង /nɨŋ/)

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Khmer typically follow the noun they modify.

Example:
- **ផ្ទះធំ** (/ptəah tʰom/) - “big house” (literally “house big”)

### Word Order

Khmer follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order.

Example:
- **ខ្ញុំញ៉ាំបាយ** (/kʰɲom ɲam baaj/) - “I eat rice”
  Subject (ខ្ញុំ) - Verb (ញ៉ាំ) - Object (បាយ)

### Classifiers

Khmer uses numeral classifiers when counting objects. The classifier comes after the number and before the noun.

Examples:
- **សៀវភៅមួយក្បាល** (/siəwpʰɨw muəj kbal/) - “one book” (literally “book one head”)
- **ឆ្កែពីរក្បាល** (/cʰkae pii kbal/) - “two dogs” (literally “dog two head”)

Common classifiers include:
- ក្បាល (**kbal**) - for animals and some objects
- នាក់ (**neak**) - for people
- ដើម (**daem**) - for plants and long cylindrical objects

### Questions

Questions in Khmer can be formed by adding question words or particles:

- **តើ** (/taə/) - general question particle, placed at the beginning of a sentence
- **ទេ** (/tee/) - yes/no question particle, placed at the end of a sentence
- **អ្វី** (/ʔvəj/) - “what”
- **ណា** (/naa/) - “which”
- **ពេលណា** (/peel naa/) - “when”
- **នៅឯណា** (/nɨw ae naa/) - “where”
- **ហេតុអ្វី** (/heet ʔvəj/) - “why”
- **យ៉ាងម៉េច** (/jaaŋ meec/) - “how”

Examples:
- **តើអ្នកឈ្មោះអ្វី?** (/taə neak chmoh ʔvəj/) - “What is your name?”
- **អ្នកទៅផ្សារទេ?** (/neak tɨw psar tee/) - “Are you going to the market?”

### Negation

Negation in Khmer is typically formed by using the word មិន (**min**) before the verb or adjective. For stronger negation, អត់ (**at**) can be used instead of or in addition to មិន.

Examples:
- **ខ្ញុំមិនទៅ** (/kʰɲom mɨn tɨw/) - “I'm not going”
- **ខ្ញុំអត់ចូលចិត្តបាយ** (/kʰɲom ʔɑt cool cət baaj/) - “I don’t like rice”

### Sentence Final Particles

Khmer uses various sentence-final particles to express mood, politeness, or emphasis:

- ហ្នឹង (**nung**) - certainty or emphasis
- ណាស់ (**nas**) - very, extremely
- ទេ (**te**) - softens statements or questions

Examples:
- **ពិបាកណាស់** (/pi-baak nas/) - “Very difficult”
- **អ្នកទៅផ្សារទេ?** (/neak tɨw psar te/) - “Are you going to the market?” (polite form)

## Vocabulary

Khmer vocabulary has been influenced by various languages throughout its history, including Sanskrit, Pali, Thai, Vietnamese, French, and English.

### Sanskrit and Pali Loanwords

Many words related to religion, royalty, and formal or academic contexts come from Sanskrit or Pali:

- **ព្រះ** (/preah/) - “sacred, royal” (from Sanskrit प्रिय “priya”)
- **សាសនា** (/saasənaa/) - “religion” (from Pali सासन “sāsana”)
- **វិទ្យាល័យ** (/wittyealəy/) - “high school” (from Sanskrit विद्यालय “vidyālaya”)

### Thai Loanwords

Due to historical and cultural connections, Khmer has borrowed some words from Thai:

- **រថយន្ត** (/rɔːtʰəjun/) - “car” (from Thai รถยนต์ “rot yon”)

### French Loanwords

Due to the French colonial period, many modern and technical terms are borrowed from French:

- **កាហ្វេ** (/kaːfei/) - “coffee” (from French “café”)
- **ប៊ិច** (/bic/) - “pen” (from French “Bic”, a brand name)
- **ម៉ូតូ** (/moːtoː/) - “motorcycle” (from French “moto”)

### English Loanwords

In recent years, many English words have entered Khmer, especially in technology and pop culture:

- **អ៊ីនធឺណិត** (/ʔiːntɨːnət/) - “internet”
- **ហ្វេសប៊ុក** (/fɛːsbuk/) - “Facebook”

### Compound Words

Khmer frequently forms new words by combining existing words:

## Colloquial Khmer

Colloquial Khmer can differ significantly from formal or written Khmer. Some common features of colloquial speech include:

### Shortened Forms

Many words are shortened in casual speech:

- **ទៅ** (/tɨw/) becomes **ទៅ៎** (/tə/) - “to go”
- **មក** (/mɔːk/) becomes **ម៉ក** (/mok/) - “to come”

### Slang and Idioms

Khmer has many idiomatic expressions and slang terms:

- **ស៊ីចុក** (/sii cuk/) - literally “eat painful”, means “delicious”
- **កុំព្រុស** (/kom pruh/) - literally “don’t boil”, means “don’t worry”

### Particle Usage

Colloquial speech often uses particles for emphasis or to express emotions:

- **ហ្អេ** (/hae/) - used to express surprise or disbelief
- **ណា** (/naa/) - used for emphasis or to soften requests
- **ហើយ** (/haəj/) - used to express completion or impatience

Example:
- **ទៅណាហើយ?** (/tɨw naa haəj/) - “Where are you going?” (with a sense of impatience)

### Pronoun Dropping

In casual speech, pronouns are often omitted when the subject is clear from context:

- Formal: **តើអ្នកទៅណា?** (/taə neak tɨw naa/) - “Where are you going?”
- Colloquial: **ទៅណា?** (/tɨw naa/) - “Where (are you) going?”

### Informal Pronouns

Colloquial Khmer uses different pronouns than formal speech:

- **អញ** (/aɲ/) - “I” (very informal, can be considered rude)
- **ងឹង** (/ŋɨŋ/) - “you” (informal, used among close friends)

### Reduplication

Khmer often uses reduplication for emphasis or to create new meanings:

- **ថ្មីៗ** (/tməj tməj/) - “brand new” (from **ថ្មី** /tməj/ “new”)
- **ស្រស់ៗ** (/srɑh srɑh/) - “very fresh” (from **ស្រស់** /srɑh/ “fresh”)

## Register System

Khmer has a complex register system that affects not only pronouns but also vocabulary choices depending on the social context. There are several levels:

1. **បណ្ដោយ** (/bɑndaoj/) - Informal speech used with friends and family
2. **សាមញ្ញ** (/saamaɲ/) - Neutral speech used in everyday situations
3. **ពាក្យសុភាព** (/piek sopʰiep/) - Polite speech used with strangers or in formal situations
4. **ពាក្យរាជា** (/piek riecʰie/) - Royal speech used when addressing or referring to royalty

Examples of register differences:

| Meaning | Informal | Neutral | Polite | Royal |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| to eat | ញ៉ាំ (/ɲam/) | ហូប (/hoop/) | ពិសា (/pisaa/) | ស្វាយ (/svaay/) |
| to sleep | ដេក (/deek/) | គេង (/keeŋ/) | សម្រាន្ត (/sɑmrant/) | បรรទម (/pɔːntum/) |
| house | ផ្ទះ (/pteah/) | ផ្ទះ (/pteah/) | គេហដ្ឋាន (/kehaʔtthaan/) | ព្រះរាជដំណាក់ (/preah riec dɑmnak/) |

## Phonological Processes

### Consonant Clusters

Khmer allows complex consonant clusters, especially in syllable-initial position:

- **ស្រី** (/srəj/) - “woman”
- **ក្រោម** (/kraom/) - “under”
- **ស្វា** (/svaa/) - “monkey”

### Final Consonants

Khmer has a limited set of consonants that can appear in syllable-final position. These are often unreleased:

- **ក** /k/, **ច** /c/, **ត** /t/, **ប** /p/ (stops)
- **ម** /m/, **ន** /n/, **ង** /ŋ/ (nasals)
- **យ** /j/, **វ** /w/ (semivowels)
- **ល** /l/, **រ** /r/ (liquids)
- **ស** /s/, **ហ** /h/ (fricatives)

### Vowel Harmony

Khmer exhibits a form of vowel harmony in some words, particularly those with infixes:

- **ស្រស់** (/srɑh/) “fresh” → **ស្រសើរ** (/srɑsaə/) “to praise”
- **ច្រើន** (/craən/) “many” → **ចំរើន** (/cɑmraən/) “to prosper”

## Syntax

### Topic-Comment Structure

While Khmer generally follows SVO order, it also frequently uses a topic-comment structure:

- **លុយវិញ ខ្ញុំគ្មាន** (/luj vɨɲ kʰɲom kmien/) - “As for money, I don’t have any” (literally “money return I not have”)

### Serial Verb Constructions

Khmer makes extensive use of serial verb constructions, where multiple verbs are strung together without conjunctions:

- **គាត់ដើរទៅផ្សារ** (/koat daə tɨw psaa/) - “He walks to the market” (literally “he walk go market”)

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Khmer typically follow the noun they modify and are introduced by the relative pronoun **ដែល** (/dael/):

- **មនុស្សដែលខ្ញុំស្គាល់** (/mənuh dael kʰɲom skoel/) - “The person whom I know”

### Comparative and Superlative

Comparatives are formed using **ជាង** (/cieŋ/) “more than”:

- **គាត់ខ្ពស់ជាងខ្ញុំ** (/koat kpuh cieŋ kʰɲom/) - “He is taller than me”

Superlatives use **ជាងគេ** (/cieŋ kee/) “more than all”:

- **គាត់ខ្ពស់ជាងគេ** (/koat kpuh cieŋ kee/) - “He is the tallest”

### Causatives

Khmer has several ways to form causatives, including the prefix **បណ្ដាល** (/bɑndaal/):

- **ដេក** (/deek/) “to sleep” → **បណ្ដាលឱ្យដេក** (/bɑndaal ʔaoj deek/) “to cause to sleep”

## Idiomatic Expressions

Khmer has many idiomatic expressions that reflect cultural values and ways of thinking:

- **ស្លាប់ដូចគ្នា ស្មើគ្នា** (/slap dooc knie smaə knie/) - “We all die the same, we are all equal” (emphasizing equality)
- **ដើរយឺតទៅមុខ ល្អជាងរត់ថយក្រោយ** (/daə jɨɨt tɨw muk lʔɑɑ cieŋ rut tʰɔɔj kraoj/) - “Walking slowly forward is better than running backward” (emphasizing steady progress)

## Numbers and Counting

Khmer uses a decimal system with unique words for numbers up to a million:

- ១ (មួយ, /muəj/) - one
- ២ (ពីរ, /pii/) - two
- ៣ (បី, /bəj/) - three
- ៤ (បួន, /buən/) - four
- ៥ (ប្រាំ, /pram/) - five
- ៦ (ប្រាំមួយ, /pram-muəj/) - six
- ៧ (ប្រាំពីរ, /pram-pii/) - seven
- ៨ (ប្រាំបី, /pram-bəj/) - eight
- ៩ (ប្រាំបួន, /pram-buən/) - nine
- ១០ (ដប់, /dɑp/) - ten
- ១០០ (មួយរយ, /muəj rɔːj/) - one hundred
- ១០០០ (មួយពាន់, /muəj poan/) - one thousand
- ១០០០០ (មួយម៉ឺន, /muəj məɨn/) - ten thousand
- ១០០០០០ (មួយសែន, /muəj saen/) - one hundred thousand
- ១០០០០០០ (មួយលាន, /muəj lien/) - one million

When counting, Khmer uses classifiers between the number and the noun:

- **សៀវភៅបីក្បាល** (/siəwpʰɨw bəj kbal/) - “three books” (literally “book three head”)

## Kinship Terms

Khmer has a complex system of kinship terms that reflects the importance of family relationships in Cambodian culture:

- **បង** (/bɔːŋ/) - older sibling (can also be used for older friends)
- **ប្អូន** (/pʔoon/) - younger sibling (can also be used for younger friends)
- **ពូ** (/puu/) - uncle (father's side)
- **មា** (/mie/) - aunt (mother's side)
- **តា** (/taa/) - grandfather
- **យាយ** (/jiej/) - grandmother

These terms are often used as pronouns in everyday speech, even for non-relatives, to show respect or familiarity.
