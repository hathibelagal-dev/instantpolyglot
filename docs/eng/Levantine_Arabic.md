# Levantine Arabic

Levantine Arabic (اللهجة الشامية, al-lahja ash-shāmiyya) is a group of vernacular Arabic dialects spoken in the Levant region, which includes Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and Israel. It's one of the most widely understood Arabic dialects due to its prevalence in Arab media and entertainment. While not a standardized language, Levantine Arabic shares many features across its subregions, with some variations in vocabulary and pronunciation.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Levantine Arabic has a rich consonant inventory, including sounds not found in many European languages. Here's a table of the main consonants:

| Arabic Letter | IPA | Romanization | Description |
|---------------|-----|--------------|-------------|
| ء | [ʔ] | ' | glottal stop |
| ب | [b] | b | voiced bilabial stop |
| ت | [t] | t | voiceless dental stop |
| ث | [θ] or [s] | th or s | voiceless dental fricative or voiceless alveolar fricative |
| ج | [ʒ] or [dʒ] | j | voiced postalveolar fricative or affricate |
| ح | [ħ] | ḥ | voiceless pharyngeal fricative |
| خ | [x] | kh | voiceless velar fricative |
| د | [d] | d | voiced dental stop |
| ذ | [ð] or [z] | dh or z | voiced dental fricative or voiced alveolar fricative |
| ر | [r] | r | alveolar trill |
| ز | [z] | z | voiced alveolar fricative |
| س | [s] | s | voiceless alveolar fricative |
| ش | [ʃ] | sh | voiceless postalveolar fricative |
| ص | [sˤ] | ṣ | pharyngealized voiceless alveolar fricative |
| ض | [dˤ] | ḍ | pharyngealized voiced dental stop |
| ط | [tˤ] | ṭ | pharyngealized voiceless dental stop |
| ظ | [zˤ] | ẓ | pharyngealized voiced alveolar fricative |
| ع | [ʕ] | ʿ | voiced pharyngeal fricative |
| غ | [ɣ] | gh | voiced velar fricative |
| ف | [f] | f | voiceless labiodental fricative |
| ق | [q] or [ʔ] | q or ' | voiceless uvular stop or glottal stop |
| ك | [k] | k | voiceless velar stop |
| ل | [l] | l | alveolar lateral approximant |
| م | [m] | m | bilabial nasal |
| ن | [n] | n | alveolar nasal |
| ه | [h] | h | voiceless glottal fricative |
| و | [w] | w | labio-velar approximant |
| ي | [j] | y | palatal approximant |

Some notable features:

1. The letter ث is often pronounced as [s] in urban dialects: **ثلاثة** (three) is pronounced [talaːte] rather than [θalaːθe].

2. The ج is generally pronounced as [ʒ] in Levantine Arabic, unlike the [dʒ] in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). For example, **جميل** (beautiful) is pronounced [ʒamiːl].

3. The ق is often pronounced as a glottal stop [ʔ] in urban dialects, especially in Lebanon and central/coastal Syria. For instance, **قلب** (heart) becomes ['alb] instead of [qalb].

### Vowels

Levantine Arabic has a simpler vowel system compared to MSA:

| IPA | Romanization | Description |
|-----|--------------|-------------|
| [a] | a | open front unrounded vowel |
| [aː] | ā | long open front unrounded vowel |
| [e] | e | close-mid front unrounded vowel |
| [eː] | ē | long close-mid front unrounded vowel |
| [i] | i | close front unrounded vowel |
| [iː] | ī | long close front unrounded vowel |
| [o] | o | close-mid back rounded vowel |
| [oː] | ō | long close-mid back rounded vowel |
| [u] | u | close back rounded vowel |
| [uː] | ū | long close back rounded vowel |

The vowels [e] and [o] are not present in MSA but are common in Levantine Arabic, often resulting from the MSA diphthongs [aj] and [aw] respectively.

### Stress

Stress in Levantine Arabic generally falls on the penultimate syllable if it's heavy (ends in a long vowel or consonant), otherwise on the antepenultimate syllable. For example:

- **مَدْرَسة** (madrase) [madˈrase] - school
- **كَتَبْت** (katabt) [kaˈtabt] - I wrote
- **بِتْكْتُب** (btuktub) [ˈbtuktub] - you write (masc.)

## Morphology

### Nouns

Levantine Arabic nouns have two genders (masculine and feminine), two numbers (singular and plural), and three states (indefinite, definite, and construct).

#### Gender

Masculine nouns typically end in a consonant, while feminine nouns often end in -e (ة):

- **كِتاب** (ktāb) - book (masc.)
- **طاوْلة** (ṭāwle) - table (fem.)

However, there are exceptions:

- **أُمّ** ('umm) - mother (fem., ends in consonant)
- **خَليفة** (khalīfe) - caliph (masc., ends in -e)

#### Number

Plural formation in Levantine Arabic can be regular or irregular:

1. Regular plurals:
   - Masculine: add -īn (ين)
     **معلّم** (m'allem) → **معلّمين** (m'allemīn) - teacher(s)
   - Feminine: replace final -e with -āt (ات)
     **سيّارة** (sayyāra) → **سيّارات** (sayyārāt) - car(s)

2. Irregular plurals (broken plurals):
   - **كِتاب** (ktāb) → **كُتُب** (kutub) - book(s)
   - **بيت** (bēt) → **بْيوت** (byūt) - house(s)

#### Definiteness

The definite article is **ال** (el-) or (l-), which assimilates to sun letters:

- **البيت** (el-bēt) - the house
- **الشمس** (esh-shams) - the sun

Indefinite nouns have no article:

- **بيت** (bēt) - a house
- **شمس** (shams) - a sun

#### Construct State (Iḍāfa)

The construct state is used for possession and compounds. The first noun (possessee) loses its definite article if present:

- **بيت الرجل** (bēt er-rajul) - the man's house
- **كتاب المدرسة** (ktāb el-madrase) - the school's book

### Pronouns

#### Personal Pronouns

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **أنا** (ana) - I | **نحنا** (neḥna) - we |
| 2nd masc. | **إنتَ** (inte) - you | **إنتو** (intu) - you |
| 2nd fem. | **إنتِ** (inti) - you | **إنتو** (intu) - you |
| 3rd masc. | **هوّ** (huwwe) - he | **همّ** (humm) - they |
| 3rd fem. | **هيّ** (hiyye) - she | **همّ** (humm) - they |

#### Possessive Suffixes

Possessive pronouns are suffixes attached to nouns:

- -i (ي): my
- -ak (َك): your (masc.)
- -ik (ِك): your (fem.)
- -o (و): his
- -ha (ها): her
- -na (نا): our
- -kon (كُن): your (pl.)

Examples:
- **بيتي** (bēti) - my house
- **كتابك** (ktābak) - your book (masc.)
- **سيارتها** (sayyāritha) - her car

### Verbs

Levantine Arabic verbs are characterized by their root system, where most verbs are derived from a three-consonant root. Verbs are conjugated for person, number, gender, tense, and mood.

#### Present Tense

The present tense is formed by adding prefixes and sometimes suffixes to the verb stem. For regular verbs:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **بَكتُب** (baktub) - I write | **بْنِكتُب** (bniktub) - we write |
| 2nd masc. | **بْتِكتُب** (btiktub) - you write | **بْتِكتُبو** (btiktubu) - you write |
| 2nd fem. | **بْتِكتْبي** (btiktubi) - you write | **بْتِكتُبو** (btiktubu) - you write |
| 3rd masc. | **بْيِكتُب** (byiktub) - he writes | **بْيِكتُبو** (byiktubu) - they write |
| 3rd fem. | **بْتِكتُب** (btiktub) - she writes | **بْيِكتُبو** (byiktubu) - they write |

Note the use of the prefix **ب** (b-) which is characteristic of Levantine Arabic and indicates habitual or ongoing action.

#### Past Tense

The past tense is formed by suffixing the verb stem:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **كَتَبْت** (katabt) - I wrote | **كَتَبْنا** (katabna) - we wrote |
| 2nd masc. | **كَتَبْت** (katabt) - you wrote | **كَتَبْتو** (katabtu) - you wrote |
| 2nd fem. | **كَتَبْتي** (katabti) - you wrote | **كَتَبْتو** (katabtu) - you wrote |
| 3rd masc. | **كَتَب** (katab) - he wrote | **كَتَبو** (katabu) - they wrote |
| 3rd fem. | **كَتْبِت** (katbit) - she wrote | **كَتَبو** (katabu) - they wrote |

#### Future Tense

The future tense is formed by adding the prefix **رح** (raḥ) to the present tense form without the **ب** (b-) prefix:

- **رح أكتُب** (raḥ aktub) - I will write
- **رح تِكتُب** (raḥ tiktub) - you will write (masc.)
- **رح يِكتُب** (raḥ yiktub) - he will write

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed by removing the **ب** (b-) prefix from the present tense form:

- **اكتُب** (ktub) - write! (masc. sg.)
- **اكتْبي** (ktubi) - write! (fem. sg.)
- **اكتُبو** (ktubu) - write! (pl.)

#### Participles

Active participles are widely used in Levantine Arabic and can function as adjectives or express ongoing actions:

- **كاتِب** (kātib) - writing / writer (masc.)
- **كاتْبة** (kātbe) - writing / writer (fem.)
- **كاتبين** (kātbīn) - writing / writers (pl.)

Example: **أنا كاتِب رسالة** (ana kātib risāle) - I am writing a letter

Passive participles express the result of an action:

- **مَكتوب** (maktūb) - written (masc.)
- **مَكتوبة** (maktūbe) - written (fem.)
- **مَكتوبين** (maktūbīn) - written (pl.)

Example: **الرسالة مَكتوبة** (er-risāle maktūbe) - The letter is written

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Levantine Arabic agree with the noun they modify in gender and number. They typically follow the noun:

- **بيت كبير** (bēt kbīr) - a big house
- **سيّارة كبيرة** (sayyāra kbīre) - a big car
- **بيوت كبيرة** (byūt kbīre) - big houses

Comparative and superlative forms are created by using the pattern أفعل (af'al):

- **كبير** (kbīr) - big
- **أكبر** (akbar) - bigger / biggest

Example: **بيتي أكبر من بيتك** (bēti akbar min bētak) - My house is bigger than your house

### Adverbs

Many adjectives can function as adverbs without any change:

- **بْيِحكي منيح** (byiḥki mnīḥ) - He speaks well

Some common adverbs:

- **كتير** (ktīr) - very, a lot
- **شوي** (shwayy) - a little
- **هَلّأ** (halla') - now
- **بُكرا** (bukra) - tomorrow

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Levantine Arabic is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), but Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) is also common, especially in more formal contexts or with certain verbs:

- SVO: **أنا بْحِبّ القهوة** (ana bḥibb el-'ahwe) - I love coffee
- VSO: **أكَل الولد التفّاحة** (akal el-walad et-teffāḥa) - The boy ate the apple

### Negation

Negation in Levantine Arabic is typically formed by adding **ما** (ma) before the verb and **ش** (-sh) after it:

- **ما بْحِبّش القهوة** (ma bḥibbish el-'ahwe) - I don't like coffee
- **ما أكَلش الولد التفّاحة** (ma akalsh el-walad et-teffāḥa) - The boy didn't eat the apple

For present tense verbs, **مش** (mish) can be used:

- **مش عارف** (mish 'ārif) - I don't know

### Questions

Yes/no questions can be formed simply by changing the intonation:

- **بْتِحْكي عربي؟** (btiḥki 'arabi?) - Do you speak Arabic?

Wh-questions use question words at the beginning of the sentence:

- **شو** (shū) - what
- **مين** (mīn) - who
- **وين** (wēn) - where
- **إيمتى** (ēmta) - when
- **كيف** (kīf) - how
- **ليش** (lēsh) - why

Examples:
- **شو بْتِحْكي؟** (shū btiḥki?) - What are you saying?
- **مين هاد؟** (mīn hād?) - Who is this?
- **وين رايح؟** (wēn rāyeḥ?) - Where are you going?

### Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences in Levantine Arabic typically use **إذا** (iza) or **لو** (law) for "if":

- **إذا بْتِروح، بْروح معك** (iza btirūḥ, brūḥ ma'ak) - If you go, I'll go with you
- **لو كان عندي وقت، كنت رُحت** (law kān 'indi wa'et, kunt ruḥt) - If I had time, I would have gone

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by **يلّي** (yalli) or **إلّي** (illi), which is equivalent to "who," "which," or "that" in English:

- **الكتاب يلّي قريتو حلو كتير** (el-ktāb yalli 'arēto ḥilu ktīr) - The book that I read is very nice
- **البنت إلّي شفناها إمبارح** (el-bint illi shufnāha imbāreḥ) - The girl whom we saw yesterday

## Dialectal Variations

While Levantine Arabic shares many features across the region, there are some notable variations between different countries and even cities:

### Lebanese Arabic

- Often considered the most "softened" version of Levantine Arabic
- Tendency to replace ق [q] with [ʔ]: **قلب** (heart) is pronounced ['alb]
- Use of **شو** (shū) for "what" instead of **إيش** (ēsh) used in some other areas

Example: **شو عم تعمل؟** (shū 'am ti'mel?) - What are you doing?

### Syrian Arabic

- Varies between regions, with Damascus dialect often considered the standard
- In some regions, ق [q] is pronounced as [q], while in others it's [ʔ]
- Use of **إيش** (ēsh) for "what" in some areas

Example: **إيش عم تساوي؟** (ēsh 'am tsāwi?) - What are you doing?

### Palestinian Arabic

- Varies between regions, with notable differences between urban and rural dialects
- Often retains the ق [q] sound
- Use of **إيش** (ēsh) for "what" is common

Example: **إيش بتعمل؟** (ēsh bti'mel?) - What are you doing?

### Jordanian Arabic

- Influenced by Bedouin dialects, especially in rural areas
- Often retains the ق [q] sound

Example: **وش تسوي؟** (wush tsawwi?) - What are you doing?

## Phonological Features

### Emphasis (Tafkhīm)

Levantine Arabic, like other Arabic dialects, features emphatic consonants. These are produced with a retracted tongue root, giving them a "heavier" sound. The emphatic consonants are:

- ص [sˤ]: **صار** (ṣār) - became
- ض [dˤ]: **ضرب** (ḍarab) - hit
- ط [tˤ]: **طيب** (ṭayyeb) - okay, good
- ظ [zˤ]: **ظل** (ẓall) - remained

Emphasis can spread to nearby sounds, affecting the pronunciation of entire syllables or words.

### Vowel Shortening

In Levantine Arabic, long vowels in Classical Arabic often become shortened, especially in unstressed syllables:

- Classical Arabic **كتاب** (kitāb) becomes **كتاب** (ktāb) - book
- Classical Arabic **سلام** (salām) becomes **سلام** (salām) - peace

### Imāla

Imāla is the fronting and raising of the long /aː/ vowel, often to [eː] or even [iː]. This is particularly common in Lebanese and some Syrian dialects:

- **باب** (bāb) may be pronounced as [beːb] - door
- **نار** (nār) may be pronounced as [neːr] - fire

## Lexical Features

### Existential Phrases

- **في ناس برّا** (fī nās barra) - There are people outside
- **ما في مشكلة** (mā fī mushkile) - There's no problem

### Modal Verbs

Modal verbs in Levantine Arabic are often expressed using particles:

- **لازم** (lāzem) - must, have to
  **لازم أروح** (lāzem arūḥ) - I must go

- **ممكن** (mumken) - can, may
  **ممكن أسأل سؤال؟** (mumken as'al su'āl?) - Can I ask a question?

- **بدي** (biddi) - want to (literally "in my want")
  **بدي أنام** (biddi anām) - I want to sleep

### Demonstratives

Demonstrative pronouns in Levantine Arabic:

- This (m.): **هاد** (hād)
- This (f.): **هاي** (hāy)
- These: **هدول** (hadōl)
- That (m.): **هداك** (hadāk)
- That (f.): **هديك** (hadīk)
- Those: **هدوليك** (hadōlīk)

Example: **هاد الكتاب حلو** (hād el-ktāb ḥilu) - This book is nice

### Time Expressions

## Conclusion

Levantine Arabic, with its rich phonology, flexible syntax, and expressive vocabulary, offers a fascinating linguistic landscape. Its status as a widely understood dialect, coupled with its prevalence in media and popular culture, makes it a valuable variety of Arabic to learn. While it differs from Modern Standard Arabic in many aspects, understanding Levantine Arabic provides insight into the daily lives and cultures of millions of Arabic speakers in the Levant region.

The dialect's ability to incorporate loanwords and adapt to modern concepts while maintaining its core structure demonstrates its vitality and relevance in the contemporary world. From its unique phonological features like the varied pronunciation of ق and the phenomenon of imāla, to its distinctive grammatical structures and idiomatic expressions, Levantine Arabic presents a dynamic and living form of the Arabic language.

As with any dialect, the best way to truly understand and appreciate Levantine Arabic is through immersion and practice with native speakers. The nuances of pronunciation, the subtleties of idiomatic usage, and the cultural context embedded in the language are best learned through real-world interaction and continued exposure to the dialect in its natural environment.
