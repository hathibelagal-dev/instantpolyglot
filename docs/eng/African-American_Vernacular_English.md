# African-American Vernacular English

African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), also known as Black English, Black Vernacular, or Ebonics, is a variety of American English primarily spoken by urban working-class and largely bi-dialectal middle-class African Americans. It shares many features with other varieties of English spoken in the southern United States and has several distinctive grammatical features. AAVE is not considered a separate language, but rather a dialect of English with its own consistent internal logic and structure.

## Historical Development

AAVE has its roots in the language contact between speakers of various West African languages and English speakers in the American South during the Atlantic slave trade. The development of AAVE was influenced by several factors:

1. Creolization: Some linguists argue that AAVE developed from a creole language that emerged during slavery.

2. Dialect Mixing: Others propose that AAVE resulted from the mixing of various English dialects spoken by British settlers and enslaved Africans.

3. Substrate Influence: West African languages likely influenced the development of AAVE grammar and phonology.

4. Great Migration: The movement of African Americans from the rural South to urban areas in the North and West during the 20th century contributed to the spread and evolution of AAVE.

## Phonology

AAVE phonology includes several features that distinguish it from Standard American English (SAE) and other dialects.

### Consonants

1. Th-fronting: The voiced and voiceless dental fricatives /ð/ and /θ/ are often realized as labiodental fricatives [v] and [f], respectively.

   Examples:
   - **this** [ðɪs] → **dis** [dɪs]
   - **with** [wɪð] → **wif** [wɪf]
   - **nothing** [ˈnʌθɪŋ] → **nuffin** [ˈnʌfɪn]

2. Th-stopping: In some cases, /ð/ and /θ/ may be realized as stops [d] and [t].

   Examples:
   - **these** [ðiz] → **deez** [diz]
   - **think** [θɪŋk] → **tink** [tɪŋk]

3. Final consonant cluster reduction: Word-final consonant clusters are often simplified, especially those ending in /t/ or /d/.

   Examples:
   - **test** [tɛst] → **tes** [tɛs]
   - **hand** [hænd] → **han** [hæn]

4. L-vocalization: The /l/ sound is often vocalized to a vowel or semivowel, especially in word-final position or before consonants.

   Examples:
   - **help** [hɛlp] → **hep** [hɛp]
   - **pull** [pʊl] → **poo** [pʊ]

5. R-dropping: Like many non-rhotic dialects, AAVE often drops the /r/ sound when it occurs after vowels.

   Examples:
   - **car** [kɑr] → **cah** [kɑ]
   - **four** [fɔr] → **fo** [fɔ]

6. Consonant devoicing: Word-final voiced consonants may be devoiced.

   Example:
   - **cab** [kæb] → [kæp]

7. /skr/ cluster: Some speakers may pronounce the /str/ cluster as /skr/.

   Example:
   - **street** [strit] → **skreet** [skrit]

### Vowels

1. Pin-pen merger: The vowels in words like “pin” and “pen” are often pronounced the same, typically as [ɪ].

   Example:
   - **pen** [pɛn] and **pin** [pɪn] → both pronounced as [pɪn]

2. Monophthongization of certain diphthongs:

   - /aɪ/ → [a:] before voiced consonants and word-finally
     Example: **ride** [raɪd] → **rahd** [ra:d]

   - /ɔɪ/ → [ɔ:] in some words
     Example: **boil** [bɔɪl] → **boll** [bɔ:l]

3. Vowel lowering before /r/:

   Example:
   - **here** [hɪr] → **hurr** [hər]

4. Vowel raising: The vowel /æ/ may be raised to [ɛ] or even [e] in some environments.

   Example:
   - **bad** [bæd] → [bɛd] or [bed]

5. Vowel breaking: Some monophthongs may be pronounced as diphthongs.

   Example:
   - **bed** [bɛd] → [bɪəd]

### Stress and Intonation

AAVE often exhibits a different stress pattern compared to SAE, with a tendency towards syllable-timing rather than stress-timing. This can result in a perceived “singsong” quality to the speech.

Example:
- SAE: “I'm GO-ing to the STORE.”
- AAVE: “I'm go-ING to the STO-re.”

AAVE also features distinctive intonation patterns, often with a wider pitch range than SAE. This contributes to the perceived musicality of AAVE speech.

### Phonological Processes

Several phonological processes are common in AAVE:

1. Metathesis: The reordering of sounds within a word.

   Example:
   - **ask** [æsk] → **aks** [æks]

2. Deletion of unstressed syllables: Particularly common in words beginning with schwa.

   Example:
   - **about** [əˈbaʊt] → **'bout** [baʊt]

3. Consonant cluster simplification: Especially in word-final positions.

   Example:
   - **past** [pæst] → **pas'** [pæs]

4. Devoicing of word-final voiced stops: Final /b/, /d/, and /g/ may be devoiced.

   Example:
   - **cab** [kæb] → [kæp]

5. Neutralization of /ɪ/ and /ɛ/ before nasals: The “pin-pen” merger.

   Example:
   - **tin** [tɪn] and **ten** [tɛn] both pronounced as [tɪn]

## Grammar

AAVE grammar has several distinctive features that set it apart from SAE. These features are systematic and rule-governed, demonstrating that AAVE is a fully developed linguistic system.

### Verbs

1. Habitual “be”: The word “be” is used to indicate habitual or recurring actions.

   Examples:
   - **He be working late** (He habitually works late)
   - **They be playing basketball on Saturdays** (They regularly play basketball on Saturdays)

2. Absence of copula: The conjugated forms of “to be” are often omitted in the present tense, particularly in contracted positions.

   Examples:
   - **She nice** (She is nice)
   - **They hungry** (They are hungry)
   - **We good** (We are good)

   Note: The copula is usually retained in sentence-final position and before vowels:
   - **That's what it is**
   - **He is angry**

3. Use of “done” for completed actions: The word “done” is used as an auxiliary to indicate a completed action.

   Examples:
   - **I done told you** (I have already told you)

4. Invariant “be” for future events: “Be” can be used to indicate future events.

   Examples:
   - **We be there tomorrow** (We will be there tomorrow)
   - **They be leaving next week** (They will be leaving next week)

5. Multiple negation: Unlike in SAE, multiple negatives are used to intensify negation rather than cancel it out.

   Examples:
   - **I ain't never seen nobody like that** (I have never seen anybody like that)
   - **Don’t nobody want no trouble** (Nobody wants any trouble)

6. Use of “ain't”: “Ain't” is used as a general negator, replacing “am not,” “isn’t,” “aren’t,” “hasn’t,” and “haven't.”

   Examples:
   - **He ain't here** (He isn’t here)
   - **I ain't seen him** (I haven't seen him)
   - **That ain't right** (That isn’t right)

7. Regularization of irregular verbs: Some irregular verbs are conjugated regularly in AAVE.

   Examples:
   - **He knowed the answer** (He knew the answer)
   - **They gived us the money** (They gave us the money)
   - **She seened it yesterday** (She saw it yesterday)

8. Absence of third-person singular present tense -s: The -s ending is often omitted in third-person singular present tense verbs.

   Examples:
   - **He walk to work every day** (He walks to work every day)
   - **She like pizza** (She likes pizza)

9. Use of “finna” or “fixing to”: These phrases are used to indicate imminent future action.

   Examples:
   - **I'm finna go to the store** (I'm about to go to the store)
   - **We fixing to eat** (We're about to eat)

10. Past tense formed by verb stem: In some cases, the past tense is indicated by context rather than verb inflection.

    Examples:
    - **He come in yesterday and say he ain't got no money** (He came in yesterday and said he didn't have any money)

11. Use of “steady” as an intensifying adverb:

    Example:
    - **She steady talking** (She's continuously talking)

12. Double modals: The use of two modal auxiliaries in a single clause.

    Examples:
    - **I might could do that** (I might be able to do that)
    - **We may can go tomorrow** (We may be able to go tomorrow)

### Nouns and Pronouns

1. Possessive pronouns without apostrophe-s: Possessive pronouns are often used without the apostrophe-s.

   Examples:
   - **That John car** (That's John's car)
   - **It's they house** (It's their house)

2. “Y'all” as second person plural: “Y'all” (or “ya'll”) is commonly used as the second person plural pronoun.

   Examples:
   - **Y'all coming to the party?** (Are you all coming to the party?)
   - **Where y'all been?** (Where have you all been?)

3. “Them” as demonstrative: “Them” can be used as a demonstrative adjective.

   Examples:
   - **Them boys over there** (Those boys over there)
   - **Give me them shoes** (Give me those shoes)

4. Existential “it”: “It” can be used instead of “there” in existential sentences.

   Examples:
   - **It's a party tonight** (There's a party tonight)
   - **It ain't no more food** (There isn’t any more food)

5. Appositive pronouns: Pronouns may be used in apposition to a noun subject.

   Example:
   - **My brother he just got a new job** (My brother just got a new job)

### Question Formation

1. Absence of auxiliary verb inversion: In questions, the auxiliary verb often remains in its declarative position.

   Examples:
   - **Why you ain't coming?** (Why aren’t you coming?)
   - **What he doing?** (What is he doing?)

2. Use of negative inversion: In negative questions, the negative element can be moved to the beginning of the sentence.

   Examples:
   - **Don’t nobody want no trouble** (Doesn’t anybody want any trouble?)
   - **Ain't you going to the store?** (Aren’t you going to the store?)

### Other Grammatical Features

1. Use of “for to” infinitive: “For to” can be used to introduce an infinitive phrase.

   Examples:
   - **I'm trying for to help you** (I'm trying to help you)
   - **She went to the store for to buy some milk** (She went to the store to buy some milk)

2. “Come” as a semi-auxiliary verb: “Come” can be used to express indignation.

   Examples:
   - **He come telling me I'm wrong** (He had the nerve to tell me I'm wrong)
   - **Don’t come acting like you don’t know** (Don’t pretend you don’t know)

3. Completive “done”: “Done” can be used to emphasize the completed nature of an action.

   Examples:
   - **I done told you already** (I've already told you)
   - **She done gone home** (She has gone home)

4. Resultative “been”: “Been” can be used to indicate that an action began in the distant past and continues into the present.

   Examples:
   - **I been knowing him** (I've known him for a long time)
   - **She been married** (She has been married for a long time)

5. Remote past “BIN”: A stressed “BIN” (often written as “been” but pronounced differently) indicates an action that happened or began a long time ago.

   Examples:
   - **She BIN married** (She has been married for a very long time)
   - **I BIN done my homework** (I finished my homework a long time ago)

6. Preterite “had”: “Had” can be used in narrative contexts to describe a simple past event.

   Example:
   - **We had went to the store** (We went to the store)

It's important to note that AAVE vocabulary, especially slang terms, can change rapidly and vary by region and age group. What's considered current in one area might be outdated in another, and younger speakers often use terms that older speakers might not recognize.

## Syntax

While AAVE follows many of the same syntactic patterns as other varieties of English, it has some distinctive features:

1. Topic-comment structure: AAVE often uses a topic-comment structure where the topic is introduced first, followed by a comment about it.

   Examples:
   - **The coffee, it's too hot** (As for the coffee, it's too hot)
   - **My brother, he works downtown** (As for my brother, he works downtown)

2. Zero copula in complex sentences: In complex sentences, the copula (form of “to be”) can be omitted in the main clause but retained in the subordinate clause.

   Examples:
   - **He Ø nice when he Ø sleeping, but he is mean when he is awake**
   - **She Ø smart, even though she Ø not trying**

3. Relative clauses without relative pronouns: Relative clauses can be formed without relative pronouns.

   Examples:
   - **That's the man Ø come here yesterday** (That's the man who came here yesterday)
   - **I know a girl Ø can help you** (I know a girl who can help you)

4. Serial verb constructions: Multiple verbs can be used in sequence without conjunctions.

   Examples:
   - **She come walk in here like she own the place** (She came walking in here as if she owned the place)
   - **I'm a go try find it** (I'm going to try to find it)

5. Aspectual markers: Words like “been,” “done,” and “finna” are used as aspectual markers to indicate the timing or nature of an action.

   Examples:
   - **I been knowing that** (I've known that for a long time)
   - **He done lost his mind** (He has completely lost his mind)
   - **We finna eat** (We're about to eat)

6. Tag questions: AAVE uses distinctive tag questions, often with invariant “ain't.”

   Examples:
   - **You coming, ain't you?** (You're coming, aren’t you?)
   - **That's good, ain't it?** (That's good, isn’t it?)

7. Quotative expression: “Be like” is commonly used to introduce reported speech or thoughts.

   Examples:
   - **He be like, “I ain't doing that”** (He said, “I'm not doing that”)
   - **She was like, “Where you been at?”** (She said, “Where have you been?”)

8. Existential “it”: The use of “it” instead of “there” in existential constructions.

   Examples:
   - **It's a party tonight** (There's a party tonight)
   - **It ain't no more food left** (There isn’t any more food left)

9. Double subjects: The use of a pronoun immediately after the subject for emphasis.

   Examples:
   - **My mama she told me to clean my room** (My mama told me to clean my room)
   - **That boy he always causing trouble** (That boy is always causing trouble)

10. Negative concord: The use of multiple negative elements to express a single negation.

    Examples:
    - **I ain't never seen nobody like that** (I have never seen anybody like that)
    - **Don’t nobody want no problems** (Nobody wants any problems)

## Prosody

AAVE has distinctive prosodic features that contribute to its unique sound:

1. Pitch: AAVE often uses a wider pitch range than SAE, contributing to its perceived musicality.

2. Rhythm: AAVE tends towards a more syllable-timed rhythm, as opposed to the stress-timed rhythm of SAE. This means that syllables are given more equal weight, contributing to a perceived “bouncy” quality in the speech.

3. Intonation patterns: Distinctive intonation patterns are used for emphasis and to convey meaning.

   Examples:
   - Rising intonation on statements to indicate disbelief or challenge: **You did WHAT?**
   - Fall-rise intonation for emphasis: **I TOLD you** (with a fall on “told” and a rise on “you”)

4. Stress patterns: Stress may be placed differently than in SAE for emphasis or rhythmic reasons.

   Examples:
   - **POlice** instead of **poLICE**
   - **DEtroit** instead of **DeTROIT**

5. Vowel lengthening: Vowels may be lengthened for emphasis or stylistic effect.

   Example:
   - **That's cra::zy** (with a prolonged “a” sound)

6. Word-final devoicing: This can affect the rhythm and sound of speech, particularly in combination with consonant cluster reduction.

   Example:
   - **good** [gʊd] → [gʊt]

7. Glottalization: The use of a glottal stop, particularly in word-final positions, can contribute to the rhythmic pattern of speech.

   Example:
   - **what** [wʌt] → [wʌʔ]

These prosodic features, combined with the phonological and grammatical characteristics of AAVE, contribute to its distinctive sound and rhythm, which has had a significant influence on American music, particularly in genres like hip-hop, R&B, and jazz.

## Variation within AAVE

Like all dialects, AAVE is not monolithic and shows variation based on several factors:

1. Regional differences: AAVE in the Southern United States may differ from AAVE in Northern urban areas. For example:
   - Southern AAVE may have more pronounced vowel shifting
   - Northern AAVE might have more influence from other urban dialects

2. Age: Younger speakers may use different vocabulary and grammatical constructions than older speakers. For instance:
   - Younger speakers might use more recent slang terms
   - Older speakers might retain some features that are becoming less common among younger speakers

3. Social class: Middle-class speakers may code-switch more frequently between AAVE and SAE. They might:
   - Use fewer AAVE features in professional settings
   - Employ more SAE grammar while retaining AAVE phonology

4. Gender: Some studies suggest differences in AAVE usage between men and women. For example:
   - Some research suggests that women might use fewer non-standard forms in certain contexts
   - Men might be more likely to use certain slang terms

5. Urban vs. rural: Urban AAVE may incorporate more recent innovations and slang terms, while rural AAVE might preserve older forms.

6. Education level: Speakers with higher levels of formal education might use AAVE features selectively or in specific contexts.

7. Style-shifting: AAVE speakers often adjust their speech based on the social context, audience, and topic of conversation.

8. Individual variation: As with any language variety, individual speakers may have their own idiosyncrasies and preferences in how they use AAVE.

## Code-switching

Many AAVE speakers are bidialectal and can switch between AAVE and SAE depending on the social context. This process, known as code-switching, involves adjusting vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation to suit different situations.

Example of code-switching:
- AAVE: **Yo, what's good? You tryna hit that party tonight?**
- SAE: **Hello, how are you? Are you planning to attend the party this evening?**

Code-switching can occur:
1. Between sentences
2. Within a single sentence
3. At the level of individual words or phrases

Factors influencing code-switching include:
1. The setting (formal vs. informal)
2. The audience (friends vs. authority figures)
3. The topic of conversation
4. The speaker's intention (to create distance or solidarity)

Code-switching is a complex skill that requires a high level of linguistic competence in both dialects. It's often used strategically to navigate different social situations and to express multiple aspects of identity.

## Influence on Popular Culture

AAVE has had a significant influence on American popular culture, particularly through music (especially hip-hop and R&B), film, and social media. Many AAVE terms and expressions have entered mainstream American English.

1. Music: Hip-hop and R&B, genres deeply rooted in African American culture, have popularized many AAVE terms and grammatical features. Examples include:
   - Use of habitual “be” in lyrics
   - Incorporation of AAVE slang into song titles and lyrics
   - The rhythmic patterns of rap often reflect AAVE prosody

2. Film and Television: AAVE is often featured in movies and TV shows, particularly those focusing on African American characters or urban settings. This has helped to familiarize wider audiences with AAVE features.

3. Social Media: Platforms like Twitter have become spaces where AAVE terms and expressions gain widespread use, often spreading to other demographic groups.

4. Comedy: Many comedians use AAVE in their performances, both as a reflection of their own speech patterns and as a way to connect with audiences.

5. Advertising: Some companies have incorporated AAVE terms or grammatical features into their advertising to appeal to certain demographics or to appear current and trendy.

6. Literature: African American authors often incorporate AAVE into their writing, both in dialogue and narrative voice, as a way of authentically representing characters and communities.

Examples of AAVE terms that have entered mainstream usage:
- **bling** (flashy jewelry)
- **cool** (excellent, fashionable)
- **diss** (to disrespect)
- **hip** (trendy, aware)
- **jazz** (both the music genre and as a verb meaning to excite or energize)

It's important to note that while the widespread adoption of AAVE terms can be seen as a testament to the dialect's expressive power, it has also led to discussions about cultural appropriation and the decontextualization of language deeply rooted in African American experiences.

## Sociolinguistic Aspects

AAVE is a controversial topic in sociolinguistics and education. Some key points of discussion include:

1. Language vs. Dialect: Debates about whether AAVE should be considered a separate language or a dialect of English. This discussion often intersects with issues of language prestige and social power.

2. Education: Controversies surrounding the use of AAVE in educational settings and its impact on literacy. Key issues include:

   - Misconceptions about AAVE being “broken” or “lazy” English
   - The impact of linguistic discrimination in areas like employment and housing
   - The psychological effects of language stigma on AAVE speakers

4. Identity: The role of AAVE in expressing and maintaining African American cultural identity. This includes:
   - The use of AAVE as a marker of in-group solidarity
   - The complex relationship between language, race, and identity in the United States
   - The challenges faced by AAVE speakers in navigating multiple linguistic identities

5. Language change: The influence of AAVE on other varieties of English and its own ongoing evolution. This includes:
   - The adoption of AAVE terms and features by non-AAVE speakers
   - The impact of social media and global hip-hop culture on the spread of AAVE features
   - The development of new AAVE features and the loss of older ones

6. Linguistic research: The study of AAVE has contributed significantly to our understanding of language variation and change. Key areas of research include:
   - The origins and historical development of AAVE
   - The systematic nature of AAVE grammar and phonology
   - The social and cultural factors influencing AAVE usage

7. Media representation: The way AAVE is portrayed in media can influence public perceptions of the dialect and its speakers. This includes:
   - Stereotypical or exaggerated representations of AAVE in film and television
   - The role of social media in disseminating and sometimes misappropriating AAVE terms
   - The increasing presence of authentic AAVE in mainstream media

8. Language policy: Debates about how AAVE should be treated in official contexts, such as:
   - Whether AAVE should be recognized as a distinct variety in legal or governmental settings
   - How to address AAVE in language education policies
   - The role of AAVE in preserving and promoting African American cultural heritage

These sociolinguistic aspects of AAVE highlight the complex interplay between language, culture, identity, and social power. They underscore the importance of understanding AAVE not just as a linguistic system, but as a vital part of African American culture and history.
