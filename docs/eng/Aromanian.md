# Aromanian

Aromanian (autonym: **Armãneashti** or **Rrãmãneshti**) is an Eastern Romance language spoken primarily in parts of Greece, Albania, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Romania. It is closely related to Romanian, sharing many grammatical features and much vocabulary. The number of speakers is estimated to be between 250,000 and 500,000, though exact figures are difficult to determine due to the lack of official recognition in most countries where it is spoken.

## Morphology

Aromanian, like other Romance languages, is largely inflectional.

### Nouns

Nouns in Aromanian have two genders (masculine and feminine), two numbers (singular and plural), and three cases (nominative/accusative, genitive/dative, and vocative).

#### Gender

Most nouns ending in consonants are masculine, while most nouns ending in -ã or -e are feminine. There are exceptions:

- Masculine: **frati** (brother), **om** (man), **cal** (horse)
- Feminine: **casã** (house), **featã** (girl), **mumã** (mother)

#### Number

Plural formation in Aromanian can be complex, with several patterns:

1. Adding -i:
   - **frati** → **frats** (brother → brothers)
   - **lup** → **lupi** (wolf → wolves)

2. Changing final -ã to -i:
   - **casã** → **casi** (house → houses)
   - **mumã** → **mumi** (mother → mothers)

3. Adding -uri (for some neuter nouns):
   - **lucru** → **lucruri** (thing → things)

4. Irregular plurals:
   - **om** → **oaminj** (man → men)
   - **ficior** → **ficiori** (boy → boys)

#### Case

Case is marked primarily through articles and prepositions. The definite article is postposed:

- Nominative/Accusative: **omlu** (the man)
- Genitive/Dative: **a omlui** (of/to the man)
- Vocative: **omle!** (O man!)

### Articles

Aromanian has both definite and indefinite articles.

#### Definite articles

The definite article is postposed and agrees in gender and number with the noun:

- Masculine singular: -lu, -le
  - **omlu** (the man)
  - **fratile** (the brother)

- Feminine singular: -a
  - **casa** (the house)
  - **feata** (the girl)

- Masculine plural: -lji
  - **oaminjlji** (the men)

#### Indefinite articles

The indefinite article precedes the noun:

- Masculine singular: **un**
  - **un om** (a man)

- Feminine singular: **unã**
  - **unã casã** (a house)

### Adjectives

Adjectives agree in gender and number with the nouns they modify. Most adjectives have four forms:

- **mushat** (beautiful):
  - Masculine singular: **mushat**
  - Feminine singular: **mushatã**
  - Masculine plural: **mushats**
  - Feminine plural: **mushati**

Example: 
- **un om mushat** (a beautiful man)

- **Fratile a tãu** (Your brother)

### Verbs

Aromanian verbs are highly inflected, showing distinctions in person, number, tense, mood, and aspect.

#### Conjugation classes

There are four main conjugation classes in Aromanian, based on the infinitive ending:

1. -ari: **cãntari** (to sing)
2. -eari: **videari** (to see)
3. -iri: **avdziri** (to hear)
4. -ãri: **mãcãri** (to eat)

| 1 | **cãntu** | **cãntãm** |
| 2 | **cãnts** | **cãntats** |
| 3 | **cãntã** | **cãntã** |

#### Past tense

Aromanian has several past tenses. The most common is the perfect simple:

Conjugation of **cãntari** in the perfect simple:

#### Future tense

The future is formed using the auxiliary **va** (will) plus the subjunctive form of the main verb:

- **Va s-cãntu** (I will sing)
- **Va s-cãnts** (You will sing)
- **Va s-cãntã** (He/She will sing)

#### Subjunctive mood

The subjunctive is formed using the particle **s-** plus a modified present tense form:

- **s-cãntu** (that I sing)
- **s-cãnts** (that you sing)
- **s-cãntã** (that he/she sings)

#### Imperative mood

The imperative is used for commands:

- Singular: **Cãntã!** (Sing!)
- Plural: **Cãntats!** (Sing! - to multiple people)

### Adverbs

Many adverbs are formed by adding the suffix -a to the feminine form of adjectives:

- **mushat** (beautiful) → **mushata** (beautifully)
- **bun** (good) → **buna** (well)

Example:
- **El cãntã mushata** (He sings beautifully)

## Syntax

### Word order

The basic word order in Aromanian is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), but it can be flexible due to the case system:

- **Io ved omlu** (I see the man)
- **Omlu lu ved io** (The man, I see him - for emphasis)

### Questions

Questions can be formed by intonation alone or by using interrogative words:

- **Tini vedz omlu?** (Do you see the man?)
- **Tsi vedz?** (What do you see?)
- **Cari vini?** (Who is coming?)

### Negation

Negation is formed by placing **nu** before the verb:

- **Io nu ved omlu** (I don't see the man)

### Subordinate clauses

Subordinate clauses often use the subjunctive mood, introduced by **ca** (that):

- **Voi ca s-yinã** (I want him to come)

## Vocabulary

Aromanian vocabulary is primarily of Latin origin, with significant influences from Greek, Albanian, and Slavic languages due to historical contact.

## Dialectal variation

Aromanian exhibits significant dialectal variation, largely corresponding to geographic distribution. Some major dialect groups include:

1. Pindus dialect (Greece)
2. Grammos-Moschopolis dialect (Albania, North Macedonia)
3. Farsherot dialect (Albania, Greece)
4. Olympus dialect (Greece)

Some notable dialectal differences:

- Pronunciation of 'rr': Some dialects pronounce it as [r], others as [ʁ]
- Treatment of unstressed vowels: Some dialects tend to drop them more readily
- Lexical differences: e.g., "bãrbat" vs "gioni" for "man"

Example of dialectal variation:
- Standard: **Nu pot s-dormu** (I can't sleep)
- Farsherot: **Nu pot si dormu**

## Orthography

Aromanian has no standardized orthography, and several writing systems have been proposed and used. The most common ones are based on the Latin alphabet, sometimes with additional diacritics.

Common letters and digraphs:

- **ã** or **â**: represents /ɨ/
- **dh**: represents /ð/ (in some dialects)
- **gh**: represents /g/ before front vowels
- **lj**: represents /ʎ/
- **nj**: represents /ɲ/
- **sh**: represents /ʃ/
- **th**: represents /θ/ (in some dialects)
- **ts**: represents /ts/

Example text in Aromanian:

**Tuts oaminjlji s-fac liberi shi egali la nãmuzea shi ndrepturli. Elji suntu hãrisiţ cu filechi shi sinidisi shi lipseashti un cu alantu sh-si poartã tu duhlu a frãtiljei.**

(All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.)

## Grammar particularities

### Balkan sprachbund features

Aromanian, like other Balkan languages, exhibits features of the Balkan sprachbund:

1. Postposed definite article:
   - **om** (man) → **omlu** (the man)

2. Analytic future tense with "will":
   - **Va s-cãntu** (I will sing)

3. Lack of infinitive, replaced by subjunctive constructions:
   - **Voi s-cãntu** (I want to sing, lit. "I want that I sing")

4. Clitic doubling:
   - **Lu ved omlu** (I see the man, lit. "Him I-see the-man")

5. Evidentiality distinctions:
   - **Cãntã** (He sings - witnessed)
   - **Cãnta** (He sings/sang - reported/unwitnessed)

### Case system

While Aromanian has largely lost the Latin case system, it retains some case distinctions, particularly in pronouns and articles:

- Nominative/Accusative: **omlu** (the man)
- Genitive/Dative: **a omlui** (of/to the man)
- Vocative: **omle!** (O man!)

### Neuter gender

Unlike Romanian, Aromanian has largely lost the neuter gender. Most former neuter nouns have been reassigned to masculine or feminine:

- **lucru** (thing, work) - now masculine

### Vocative case

The vocative case is still used in Aromanian, especially for names and kinship terms:

- **frate** (brother) → **frate!** (brother!)
- **featã** (girl) → **feato!** (girl!)
- **Iani** (John) → **Iane!** (John!)

### Reduplication

Aromanian uses reduplication for emphasis or to create adverbs:

- **ghini-ghini** (very well)
- **curund-curund** (very soon)

## Verbal system

### Aspect

Aromanian verbs can express aspectual distinctions:

1. Perfective aspect:
   - **Io cãntai** (I sang - completed action)

2. Imperfective aspect:
   - **Io cãntam** (I was singing - ongoing action)

3. Iterative aspect:
   - **Io cãntãneam** (I used to sing - repeated action)

### Moods

Aromanian has several verbal moods:

1. Indicative: **Io cãntu** (I sing)
2. Subjunctive: **s-cãntu** (that I sing)
3. Imperative: **Cãntã!** (Sing!)
4. Conditional: **Vrea s-cãntam** (I would sing)
5. Presumptive: **Va s-cãntã** (He must be singing)

### Participles

Aromanian has several types of participles:

1. Present participle: **cãntãnda** (singing)
2. Past participle: **cãntatã** (sung)
3. Gerund: **cãntãndalui** (while singing)

Example:
**Cãntãndalui, nãs intrã tu casã** (While singing, he entered the house)

## Sentence structure

### Topic-comment structure

Aromanian often uses a topic-comment structure, where the topic is introduced first and then commented on:

- **Cartea, u deadi a ficiorlui** (The book, he gave it to the boy)

### Clitic placement

Object pronouns (clitics) usually precede the verb:

- **U ved** (I see her)
- **Lj-u dedim** (I gave it to him)

In compound tenses, clitics can be attached to the auxiliary:

- **U-am vidzutã** (I have seen her)

### Null subject

As a pro-drop language, Aromanian allows the omission of subject pronouns when they can be inferred from context:

- **Cãntu** (I sing) instead of **Io cãntu**

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses are introduced by **cari** (who, which):

- **Omlu cari vini** (The man who came)

## Lexical peculiarities

### Diminutives

Aromanian makes extensive use of diminutives, often with an affectionate connotation:

- **ficior** (boy) → **ficioricu** (little boy)
- **casã** (house) → **cãsicã** (little house)

### Augmentatives

Augmentatives are used to indicate large size or intensity:

- **om** (man) → **omãnjar** (big man)
- **muljari** (woman) → **muljaroanji** (big woman)

### Compound words

Aromanian forms compound words, often combining verbs with nouns or adverbs:

- **pirifan** (proud) from **piri** (carry) + **fani** (show)
- **cãciubair** (owl) from **cãciubã** (hollow) + **airi** (air)

### Idiomatic expressions

Aromanian has many idiomatic expressions:

- **Lj-si dusi bana** (He died, lit. "His life went away")
- **Ari minti multu suptãri** (He's very smart, lit. "He has a very thin mind")

## Phonological processes

### Vowel harmony

Some Aromanian dialects exhibit a form of vowel harmony, where the vowel of certain suffixes changes to match the vowel of the root:

- **bunã** (good, fem.) → **buni** (good, fem. pl.)
- but: **mushatã** (beautiful, fem.) → **mushati** (beautiful, fem. pl.)

### Consonant assimilation

Consonants often assimilate in consonant clusters:

- **faptu** (done) → **fattu** in some dialects

### Metathesis

Some words have undergone metathesis (swapping of sounds) compared to their Latin origins:

- **scãnduljiu** (splinter) from Latin *scandalum*

## Loanword adaptation

When borrowing words, Aromanian often adapts them to fit its phonological system:

- Greek "τραπέζι" (table) → Aromanian **trapeză**
- Turkish "çoban" (shepherd) → Aromanian **ciuban**

## Register and style

### Formal vs. informal speech

Aromanian distinguishes between formal and informal address:

- Informal (singular): **Cum eshti?** (How are you?)
- Formal or plural: **Cum hits?** (How are you?)

### Proverbs and sayings

Aromanian has a rich tradition of proverbs and sayings:

- **Cãnili cari alatrã nu mãshicã** (The dog that barks doesn't bite)
- **Omlu fãrã oaminj nu-i om** (A man without people is not a man)

### Poetic language

Aromanian has a strong oral poetry tradition, with specific features:

- Use of formulaic expressions
- Frequent use of metaphors and similes
- Rhythmic patterns based on syllable count

Example of an Aromanian folk poem opening:

**Nã dzuã di primuveara,**
**Cãndu soarili s-alinã,**
**Io ishi tu pãduri s-vedu**
**Cum creashti lilcea arinã.**

(One day in spring,
When the sun rises,
I went to the forest to see
How the sand flower grows.)

## Sociolinguistic situation

Aromanian is considered an endangered language due to several factors:

1. Lack of official status in most countries where it's spoken
2. Limited use in education and media
3. Assimilation pressures from dominant languages

Efforts for language preservation include:

- Cultural associations promoting Aromanian language and culture
- Publication of books and periodicals in Aromanian
- Online resources for learning and practicing the language

Despite these challenges, Aromanian continues to be used in everyday life in some communities, particularly in rural areas of Greece, Albania, and North Macedonia.
