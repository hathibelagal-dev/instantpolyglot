# Swahili

Swahili, also known as Kiswahili, is a Bantu language spoken by over 100 million people across East Africa, including Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It serves as a lingua franca in the region and is the national language of Tanzania and Kenya.

## Phonology and Orthography

Swahili uses the Latin alphabet, with 24 consonants and 5 vowels. The orthography is largely phonemic, meaning there is a close correspondence between spelling and pronunciation.

### Vowels

Swahili has five vowel sounds:

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| a | [a] |
| e | [ɛ] |
| i | [i] |
| o | [ɔ] |
| u | [u] |

Vowel length is not phonemic in Standard Swahili, although some dialects maintain a distinction.

### Consonants

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| b | [b] |
| ch | [tʃ] |
| d | [d] |
| f | [f] |
| g | [ɡ] |
| h | [h] |
| j | [dʒ] |
| k | [k] |
| l | [l] |
| m | [m] |
| n | [n] |
| p | [p] |
| r | [r] |
| s | [s] |
| t | [t] |
| v | [v] |
| w | [w] |
| y | [j] |
| z | [z] |

Additional consonants include:

| Letter | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| dh | [ð] |
| gh | [ɣ] |
| ng' | [ŋ] |
| ny | [ɲ] |
| sh | [ʃ] |
| th | [θ] |

### Stress

Stress in Swahili typically falls on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable of a word:

- **ki-ta-bu** [kiˈtabu] (book)
- **m-sa-fa-ra** [msaˈfara] (journey)

### Syllable Structure

Swahili syllables typically follow the pattern (C)V(N), where C is a consonant, V is a vowel, and N is a nasal consonant. Examples:

- **ndizi** [ˈndizi] (banana): NCV-CV
- **mtu** [ˈmtu] (person): NCV
- **mlima** [ˈmlima] (mountain): NCV-CV

## Morphology

Swahili is an agglutinative language with a rich system of prefixes and suffixes.

### Noun Classes

Swahili has a system of noun classes, often referred to as “genders” in Bantu linguistics. There are 15-18 noun classes, depending on the analysis. Each class has its own set of prefixes for nouns, adjectives, and verbs. Here are the main classes:

| Class | Singular Prefix | Plural Prefix | Typical Meaning |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1/2 | m-, mw- | wa- | People |
| 3/4 | m-, mw- | mi- | Trees, plants |
| 5/6 | ji-, Ø- | ma- | Fruits, paired things |
| 7/8 | ki- | vi- | Small things, languages |
| 9/10 | n-, Ø- | n-, Ø- | Animals, loanwords |
| 11 | u- | - | Abstract nouns |
| 15 | ku- | - | Verbal nouns |
| 16 | pa- | - | Locative (specific place) |
| 17 | ku- | - | Locative (general place) |
| 18 | mu- | - | Locative (inside) |

Examples:

- Class 1/2: **mtu/watu** (person/people)
- Class 3/4: **mti/miti** (tree/trees)
- Class 5/6: **tunda/matunda** (fruit/fruits)
- Class 7/8: **kitu/vitu** (thing/things)
- Class 9/10: **ndege/ndege** (bird/birds)

### Noun Formation

Nouns can be derived from verbs using various prefixes and suffixes:

- **-i** suffix for agent nouns: **mwalimu** (teacher) from **-alimu** (to teach)
- **m-** prefix and **-o** suffix for abstract nouns: **mpango** (plan) from **-panga** (to plan)
- **u-** prefix for abstract nouns: **uhuru** (freedom) from **-huru** (free)

### Adjectives

Adjectives agree with the noun they modify using class prefixes:

- **mtu mzuri** (good person)
- **watu wazuri** (good people)
- **kitu kizuri** (good thing)
- **vitu vizuri** (good things)

### Verbs

Swahili verbs are highly agglutinative, with various prefixes and suffixes indicating tense, aspect, mood, negation, and object agreement.

Basic verb structure:
(NEG) - SUBJ - TENSE - (OBJ) - ROOT - (EXT) - FINAL VOWEL

Examples:

1. **Ninasoma** (I am reading)
   ni-na-soma
   1SG-PRES-read

2. **Hatukusoma** (We did not read)
   ha-tu-ku-soma
   NEG-1PL-PAST-read

3. **Nitakupenda** (I will love you)
   ni-ta-ku-penda
   1SG-FUT-2SG.OBJ-love

4. **Wameshamaliza** (They have already finished)
   wa-mesha-maliza
   3PL-PERF.ALREADY-finish

#### Tense and Aspect Markers

- Present: **-na-**
  **Ninasoma** (I am reading)

- Past: **-li-**
  **Nilisoma** (I read)

- Future: **-ta-**
  **Nitasoma** (I will read)

- Perfect: **-me-**
  **Nimesoma** (I have read)

- Habitual: **hu-**
  **Husoma** (I usually read)

#### Negation

Negation is marked by prefixes that vary by tense and person:

- Present/Future (1st person): **si-**
  **Sisomi** (I don’t read)

- Present/Future (other persons): **ha-**
  **Hasomi** (He/She doesn’t read)

- Past: **-ku-**
  **Sikusomal** (I didn't read)

#### Object Markers

Object markers are infixed between the tense marker and the verb root:

  ni-na-mw-ona
  1SG-PRES-3SG.OBJ-see

- **Nitakuambia** (I will tell you)
  ni-ta-ku-ambia
  1SG-FUT-2SG.OBJ-tell

#### Verb Extensions

Verb extensions modify the meaning of the verb:

- Causative: **-ish-/-esh-**
  **soma** (read) → **somesha** (make read, teach)

- Reciprocal: **-an-**
  **penda** (love) → **pendana** (love each other)

- Passive: **-w-**
  **soma** (read) → **somwa** (be read)

- Applicative: **-i-/-e-**
  **soma** (read) → **somea** (read for)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **mimi** (I) | **sisi** (we) |
| 2nd | **wewe** (you) | **nyinyi** (you all) |
| 3rd | **yeye** (he/she) | **wao** (they) |

Possessive pronouns agree with the noun class:

- Class 1/2: **wangu** (my), **wako** (your), **wake** (his/her), etc.
- Class 3/4: **wangu**, **wako**, **wake**, etc.
- Class 5/6: **langu**, **lako**, **lake**, etc.

Example:
**kitabu changu** (my book)
**vitabu vyangu** (my books)

Demonstrative pronouns also agree with noun classes:

- **huyu** (this, Class 1), **hawa** (these, Class 2)
- **hiki** (this, Class 7), **hivi** (these, Class 8)
- **hii** (this, Class 9), **hizi** (these, Class 10)

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Swahili is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):

**Juma anasoma kitabu.**
Juma he-PRES-read book
“Juma is reading a book.”

However, the rich agreement system allows for flexibility:

**Kitabu anakisoma Juma.**
book he-PRES-it-read Juma
“The book, Juma is reading it.”

### Agreement

Nouns control agreement on verbs, adjectives, and other elements:

**Mtoto mdogo anacheza.**
child small he-PRES-play
“The small child is playing.”

**Watoto wadogo wanacheza.**
children small they-PRES-play
“The small children are playing.”

### Copula

The verb “to be” (**kuwa**) is often omitted in the present tense:

**Juma mwalimu.**
Juma teacher
“Juma is a teacher.”

In other tenses, it's explicitly used:

**Juma alikuwa mwalimu.**
Juma he-PAST-be teacher
“Juma was a teacher.”

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by intonation or by using the question particle **je**:

**Unasoma?**
you-PRES-read
“Are you reading?”

**Je, unasoma?**
Q you-PRES-read
“Are you reading?”

Wh-questions use interrogative words in situ:

**Unasoma nini?**
you-PRES-read what
“What are you reading?”

**Unaenda wapi?**
you-PRES-go where
“Where are you going?”

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are formed using the relative marker **-o-** infixed in the verb:

**Kitabu ninachokisoma ni kizuri.**
book I-PRES-REL-it-read is good
“The book that I am reading is good.”

### Comparison

Comparatives are formed with **kuliko** (than):

**Juma ni mrefu kuliko Asha.**
Juma is tall than Asha
“Juma is taller than Asha.”

Superlatives use **-a** + noun class agreement + **-ote** (all):

**Juma ni mrefu wa wote.**
Juma is tall of all
“Juma is the tallest of all.”

## Vocabulary

Swahili vocabulary is derived from various sources:

1. Bantu roots (majority):
   **-tembea** (to walk), **-lala** (to sleep)

2. Arabic loanwords:
   **kitabu** (book), **wakati** (time)

3. English loanwords:
   **kompyuta** (computer), **baiskeli** (bicycle)

4. Persian loanwords:
   **chai** (tea), **serikali** (government)

5. Portuguese loanwords:
   **meza** (table), **bendera** (flag)

6. German loanwords:
   **shule** (school), **hela** (money)

### Word Formation

Swahili employs various strategies for word formation:

1. Compounding:
   **mwanamke** (woman) = **mwana** (child) + **mke** (wife)

2. Derivation:
   **mwalimu** (teacher) from **-alimu** (to teach)

3. Reduplication:
   **polepole** (slowly) from **pole** (gentle)

### Idiomatic Expressions

  Lit: To eat a lot of salt
  Meaning: To live a long time

- **Kupiga maji**
  Lit: To hit water
  Meaning: To waste time

- **Kuwa na mkono mrefu**

## Dialectal Variation

While Standard Swahili (based on the Zanzibar dialect) is widely used, there are several dialects with phonological, lexical, and grammatical differences:

1. Kiunguja: The basis for Standard Swahili, spoken in Zanzibar

2. Kimvita: Spoken in Mombasa, Kenya

3. Kiamu: Spoken on Lamu Island, Kenya

4. Kingwana: A dialect spoken in the Democratic Republic of Congo

5. Chimwiini: Spoken in southern Somalia

Dialectal differences can include:

- Phonological variations: e.g., [l] vs [r] in some words
- Lexical differences: different words for the same concept
- Grammatical variations: different tense markers or agreement patterns

## Colloquial Swahili

Colloquial Swahili, especially as spoken by youth in urban areas, often differs from the standard language:

1. Shortened forms:
   **sina** instead of **siwezi** (I can’t)

2. Slang terms:
   **poa** (cool), **mzuka** (ghost, problem)

3. Code-mixing with English:
   **Niko busy sana** (I'm very busy)

4. Sheng: A mixed language based on Swahili, English, and local languages, popular in Kenya:
   **Vipi mandem** (How are you, guys?)

5. Tense simplification:
   Using **-na-** for both present and past actions in casual speech

6. Omission of subject markers in casual speech:
   **Unaenda wapi?** → **Naenda wapi?** (Where are you going?)

These colloquial forms are common in everyday speech but are generally avoided in formal writing or speech.

## Phonological Processes

Swahili exhibits several phonological processes that affect pronunciation:

1. Vowel harmony: 
   Some verb extensions change their vowel to harmonize with the verb root:
   **-pika** (cook) → **-pikia** (cook for)
   **-soma** (read) → **-somea** (read for)

2. Consonant assimilation:
   The prefix **n-** assimilates to the following consonant:
   **n-** + **piga** → **mpiga** (I hit)
   **n-** + **taka** → **ntaka** (I want)

3. Vowel coalescence:
   When vowels meet at morpheme boundaries, they often coalesce:
   **ni** + **-anza** → **nanza** (I begin)
   **ku** + **-ita** → **kuita** (to call)

4. Glide formation:
   High vowels become glides before other vowels:
   **ki-** + **-etu** → **chetu** (our, Class 7)
   **mu-** + **-itu** → **mwitu** (forest)

## Verb System

The Swahili verb system is complex and expressive. Here are more details:

### Infinitive

The infinitive is formed with the prefix **ku-**:
**kusoma** (to read)
**kuimba** (to sing)

### Imperative

The imperative is formed by using the verb root for singular and adding **-eni** for plural:
**Soma!** (Read! - singular)
**Someni!** (Read! - plural)

### Conditional

The conditional is formed with the prefix **-nge-** or **-ngali-**:
**Ningependa** (I would like)

### Subjunctive

The subjunctive is formed by changing the final **-a** to **-e**:
**Niseme** (Let me say)

### Habitual Past

The habitual past is formed with the prefix **-ki-**:
**Nilikisoma** (I used to read)

### Consecutive Tense

Used for sequences of actions, formed with **-ka-**:
