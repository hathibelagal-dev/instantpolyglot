# Igbo

Igbo (Asụsụ Igbo) is a Niger-Congo language spoken primarily in southeastern Nigeria by approximately 24 million people, mainly of the Igbo ethnic group. It is one of the three major languages in Nigeria, alongside Yoruba and Hausa. Igbo is written in the Latin alphabet and has a rich tonal system that plays a crucial role in distinguishing meaning.

## Phonology

### Vowels

Igbo has 8 vowels:

| Vowel | IPA | Example |
|-------|-----|---------|
| a | /a/ | **aka** [aka] (hand) |
| e | /e/ | **ebe** [ebe] (place) |
| i | /i/ | **isi** [isi] (head) |
| ị | /ɪ/ | **ịkwụ** [ɪkwʊ] (to pay) |
| o | /o/ | **oche** [otʃe] (chair) |
| ọ | /ɔ/ | **ọkụ** [ɔkʊ] (fire) |
| u | /u/ | **ude** [ude] (fame) |
| ụ | /ʊ/ | **ụlọ** [ʊlɔ] (house) |

The vowels /i/, /u/, /ɪ/, and /ʊ/ are often referred to as “light” vowels, while /e/, /o/, /a/, and /ɔ/ are “heavy” vowels. This distinction is important for vowel harmony in Igbo.

### Consonants

Igbo has 28 consonant phonemes:

| Consonant | IPA | Example |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| b | /b/ | **bịa** [bɪa] (come) |
| ch | /tʃ/ | **achị** [atʃɪ] (to rule) |
| d | /d/ | **dị** [dɪ] (be) |
| f | /f/ | **afọ** [afɔ] (year) |
| g | /ɡ/ | **egwu** [eɡwu] (fear) |
| gb | /ɡ͡b/ | **agba** [aɡ͡ba] (jaw) |
| gh | /ɣ/ | **aghụghọ** [aɣʊɣɔ] (deceit) |
| gw | /ɡʷ/ | **agwọ** [aɡʷɔ] (snake) |
| h | /h/ | **ahụ** [ahʊ] (body) |
| j | /dʒ/ | **aja** [adʒa] (sand) |
| k | /k/ | **akwụkwọ** [akʷʊkʷɔ] (book) |
| kp | /k͡p/ | **akpa** [ak͡pa] (bag) |
| kw | /kʷ/ | **akwa** [akʷa] (cloth) |
| l | /l/ | **ala** [ala] (ground) |
| m | /m/ | **mmiri** [mmiri] (water) |
| n | /n/ | **nne** [nne] (mother) |
| nw | /ŋʷ/ | **nwanne** [ŋʷanne] (sibling) |
| ny | /ɲ/ | **anyị** [aɲɪ] (we) |
| ṅ | /ŋ/ | **ṅụ** [ŋʊ] (drink) |
| p | /p/ | **apị** [apɪ] (to slap) |
| r | /r/ | **eri** [eri] (to eat) |
| s | /s/ | **asị** [asɪ] (lie) |
| sh | /ʃ/ | **ishi** [iʃi] (head) |
| t | /t/ | **ite** [ite] (pot) |
| v | /v/ | **ivū** [ivū] (load) |
| w | /w/ | **ewu** [ewu] (goat) |
| y | /j/ | **ayọ** [ajɔ] (yam) |
| z | /z/ | **eze** [eze] (king) |

### Tones

Igbo is a tonal language with three basic tones:

1. High tone (´): **ákwá** (cry)
2. Low tone (`): **àkwà** (bed)
3. Mid tone (unmarked): **akwa** (cloth)

Tones are crucial for distinguishing meaning in Igbo. For example:

- **ákwá** (high-high) = cry
- **àkwà** (low-low) = bed
- **ákwà** (high-low) = egg
- **àkwá** (low-high) = bridge

Tone combinations can create additional patterns, such as rising (low-high) and falling (high-low) tones.

### Syllable Structure

The basic syllable structure in Igbo is (C)V, where C is a consonant and V is a vowel. Some examples:

- CV: **bà** (enter)
- V: **ọ́** (he/she/it)

Igbo also allows consonant clusters in some cases, particularly with the labialized consonants (kw, gw, nw) and the double articulated consonants (kp, gb):

- CGV: **kwà** (every)
- CGVV: **kwụọ** (scratch)

## Morphology

### Nouns

Igbo nouns do not have grammatical gender or articles. Plurality is often expressed through context or by adding numeral or quantifiers.

#### Noun Classes

Igbo has a system of noun classes, although it's not as extensive as in some other Niger-Congo languages. The main distinction is between animate and inanimate nouns, which affects pronoun usage and some verbal constructions.

#### Compound Nouns

Compound nouns are common in Igbo. They are usually formed by combining two nouns or a verb and a noun:

- **ụlọ** (house) + **akwụkwọ** (book) = **ụlọakwụkwọ** (school)
- **isi** (head) + **ọrụ** (work) = **isiọrụ** (boss)

### Pronouns

Igbo pronouns distinguish between singular and plural, as well as between inclusive and exclusive first person plural:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | **m** / **mụ** (I) | **anyị** (we, exclusive) <br> **ànyị** (we, inclusive) |
| 2nd | **gị** (you) | **ụnụ** (you) |
| 3rd | **ya** (he/she/it) | **ha** (they) |

Possessive pronouns are formed by adding the pronoun after the noun:

- **ụlọ m** (my house)
- **ụlọ gị** (your house)
- **ụlọ ya** (his/her/its house)
- **ụlọ anyị** (our house)
- **ụlọ ụnụ** (your house, plural)
- **ụlọ ha** (their house)

### Verbs

Igbo verbs are the most complex part of the language's morphology. They undergo various inflections to indicate tense, aspect, mood, and other grammatical categories.

#### Verb Roots

Most Igbo verbs have a simple CV structure in their root form:

- **-ri** (to eat)
- **-bịa** (to come)
- **-ga** (to go)

#### Infinitive

The infinitive is formed by adding the prefix **ị-** or **i-** to the verb root, depending on vowel harmony:

- **ịrị** (to eat)
- **ibịa** (to come)
- **ịga** (to go)

#### Tense and Aspect

Igbo uses a combination of tones, prefixes, and suffixes to indicate tense and aspect:

1. Present Simple:
   - **Ọ na-eri nri** (He/she is eating food)

2. Past Simple:
   - **Ọ riri nri** (He/she ate food)

3. Future:
   - **Ọ ga-eri nri** (He/she will eat food)

4. Perfect:
   - **Ọ eriele nri** (He/she has eaten food)

5. Progressive:
   - **Ọ na-eri nri** (He/she is eating food)

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed by using the bare verb root:

- **Rie!** (Eat!)
- **Bịa!** (Come!)

#### Negation

Verbs are negated by adding the suffix **-ghị** to the verb root:

- **Ọ rịghị nri** (He/she didn't eat food)
- **Ọ bịaghị** (He/she didn't come)

#### Verb Extensions

Igbo has a rich system of verb extensions that modify the meaning of the verb:

- Causative: **-te**
  **Ọ dịte ya mma** (He/she made it good)

- Benefactive: **-rị**
  **Ọ zụrịrị m akwụkwọ** (He/she bought a book for me)

- Pluractional: reduplication
  **Ọ na-eriri nri** (He/she eats repeatedly)

### Adjectives

In Igbo, many concepts that are expressed as adjectives in English are expressed as stative verbs:

- **Ọ dị mma** (It is good)
- **Ọ dị ojoo** (It is bad)

When used attributively, these stative verbs follow the noun they modify:

- **nwoke dị mma** (a good man)
- **nwanyị dị ukwuu** (a big woman)

There are also some true adjectives in Igbo, which usually precede the noun:

- **ọcha** (white): **ọcha akwa** (white cloth)
- **ojii** (black): **ojii ewu** (black goat)

### Adverbs

Adverbs in Igbo often follow the verb they modify:

- **Ọ na-agba ọsọ** (He/she runs quickly)
- **Ọ na-erie nwayọọ** (He/she eats slowly)

Some adverbs can also be formed by reduplication:

- **ngwa ngwa** (quickly)
- **nwayọọ nwayọọ** (very slowly)

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Igbo is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):

**Adọ** (S) **riri** (V) **ji** (O)
(Ado ate yam)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the particle **̀ọ** at the end of a statement:

- Statement: **Ị bịara** (You came)
- Question: **Ị bịara ọ̀?** (Did you come?)

Wh-questions use interrogative words at the beginning of the sentence:

- **Gịnị ka ị na-eme?** (What are you doing?)
- **Onye bịara?** (Who came?)

### Negation

Negation is typically formed by adding the suffix **-ghị** to the verb:

- Affirmative: **Ọ riri nri** (He/she ate food)
- Negative: **Ọ rịghị nri** (He/she didn't eat food)

### Serial Verb Constructions

Igbo makes extensive use of serial verb constructions, where multiple verbs are used in sequence without conjunctions:

**Ọ were ego zụta akwụkwọ**
(He/she took money bought book)
“He/she bought a book with money”

### Focus and Topicalization

Igbo uses the focus marker **ka** to emphasize particular elements in a sentence:

- **Nri ka ọ na-eri** (It's food that he/she is eating)

Topicalization is achieved by moving the topicalized element to the beginning of the sentence:

- **Akwụkwọ ahụ, ọ zụtara ya** (That book, he/she bought it)

## Phonological Processes

### Vowel Harmony

Igbo exhibits vowel harmony, where vowels in a word must belong to the same set (either all from the set /i, u, ɪ, ʊ/ or all from /e, o, a, ɔ/):

- **isi** (head) - all light vowels
- **ọkọ** (farm) - all heavy vowels

This affects affixes as well. For example, the infinitive prefix can be either **i-** or **ị-** depending on the vowels in the verb root:

- **ime** (to do) - light vowel prefix with light vowel root
- **ịkọ** (to plant) - heavy vowel prefix with heavy vowel root

### Tone Changes

Tones can change in certain grammatical constructions. For example, in possessive constructions, the tone on the possessed noun often changes to low:

- **ụlọ́** (house, high tone)
- **ụlọ̀ m** (my house, low tone on “ụlọ”)

### Assimilation

Nasal assimilation is common in Igbo. For example, the prefix **n-** assimilates to the place of articulation of the following consonant:

- **n- + ba** → **mba** (town)
- **n- + de** → **nde** (people)

## Lexicon

### Ideophones

Igbo has a rich system of ideophones, which are words that evoke sensory impressions:

- **kpọmkpọm** (sound of knocking)
- **gbim** (sound of a heavy object falling)
- **mịrịmịrị** (in small pieces)

### Loanwords

Igbo has borrowed words from various languages, particularly English:

- **tebulu** (table)
- **mọtọ** (motor, car)
- **bọọlụ** (ball)

### Kinship Terms

Igbo has a complex system of kinship terms:

- **nne** (mother)
- **nna** (father)
- **nwanne** (sibling)
- **nwa nwanne** (niece/nephew)
- **nna ochie** (grandfather)
- **nne ochie** (grandmother)

### Color Terms

Basic color terms in Igbo include:

- **ọcha** (white)
- **ojii** (black)
- **ọbara ọbara** (red)

Numbers above 10 are formed by combination:

- 11: **iri na otu** (ten and one)
- 20: **iri abụọ** (two tens)
- 100: **otu narị** (one hundred)

## Dialectal Variation

Igbo has numerous dialects, with some differences in vocabulary, pronunciation, and even grammar. Some major dialect groups include:

1. Central Igbo (Owere)
2. Onicha (Onitsha)
3. Ika
4. Ụkwụani
5. Ikwerre
6. Izzi-Ezaa-Ikwo-Mgbo

Examples of dialectal differences:

- The word for “come” varies across dialects:

The current orthography was developed in 1961 and is known as the Ọnwụ orthography.

### Tone Marking

In standard writing, tones are typically not marked. However, in linguistic or educational texts, tone marks may be used:

- Acute accent (´) for high tone
- Grave accent (`) for low tone
- Mid tone is left unmarked

Example:
**Ákwá** (cry) vs. **àkwà** (bed)

## Sentence Structure
