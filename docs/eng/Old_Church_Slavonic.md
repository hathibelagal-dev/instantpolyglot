# Old Church Slavonic

Old Church Slavonic (OCS), also known as Old Church Slavic or Old Bulgarian, was the first Slavic literary language. It was created in the 9th century by the Byzantine missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius for the purpose of translating religious texts into a language accessible to Slavic peoples. OCS served as the liturgical language for Orthodox Slavs and had a profound influence on the development of many modern Slavic languages.

## Writing Systems

Old Church Slavonic was written in two alphabets: Glagolitic and Cyrillic.

### Glagolitic Alphabet

The Glagolitic alphabet was the original script created by Saint Cyril. It consists of 41 letters, each with a name and numerical value. Here are some examples of Glagolitic letters:

| Glagolitic | Name | Sound | Numeric Value |
|------------|------|-------|---------------|
| Ⰰ | azŭ | /a/ | 1 |
| Ⰱ | buky | /b/ | 2 |
| Ⰲ | vědě | /v/ | 3 |
| Ⰳ | glagoli | /ɡ/ | 4 |
| Ⰴ | dobrо | /d/ | 5 |

### Cyrillic Alphabet

The Cyrillic alphabet, developed later by disciples of Cyril and Methodius, eventually became more widespread. It was based on the Greek uncial script with additional letters for Slavic sounds. Here's a sample of the Old Cyrillic alphabet:

| Cyrillic | Name | Sound | Numeric Value |
|----------|------|-------|---------------|
| А | azŭ | /a/ | 1 |
| Б | buky | /b/ | - |
| В | vědě | /v/ | 2 |
| Г | glagoli | /ɡ/ | 3 |
| Д | dobrо | /d/ | 4 |

## Phonology

### Vowels

Old Church Slavonic had a rich vowel system, including nasal vowels:

| OCS Letter | IPA | Description |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| а | /a/ | Open front unrounded |
| е | /e/ | Close-mid front unrounded |
| и | /i/ | Close front unrounded |
| о | /o/ | Close-mid back rounded |
| оу (ꙋ) | /u/ | Close back rounded |
| ъ | /ŭ/ | Short close back unrounded |
| ь | /ĭ/ | Short close front unrounded |
| ѣ | /æ/ or /ja/ | Open-mid front unrounded or /ja/ |
| ѧ | /ę/ | Nasal front unrounded |
| ѫ | /ǫ/ | Nasal back rounded |

Examples:
- **дꙋхъ** (duxŭ) [duxŭ] “spirit”
- **пѧть** (pętĭ) [pętĭ] “five”
- **рѫка** (rǫka) [rǫka] “hand”

### Consonants

OCS had a system of consonants typical for Slavic languages, including palatalized consonants:

| OCS Letter | IPA | Description |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| б | /b/ | Voiced bilabial plosive |
| в | /v/ | Voiced labiodental fricative |
| г | /ɡ/ | Voiced velar plosive |
| д | /d/ | Voiced dental plosive |
| ж | /ʒ/ | Voiced postalveolar fricative |
| з | /z/ | Voiced alveolar fricative |
| к | /k/ | Voiceless velar plosive |
| л | /l/ | Alveolar lateral approximant |
| м | /m/ | Bilabial nasal |
| н | /n/ | Alveolar nasal |
| п | /p/ | Voiceless bilabial plosive |
| р | /r/ | Alveolar trill |
| с | /s/ | Voiceless alveolar fricative |
| т | /t/ | Voiceless dental plosive |
| ф | /f/ | Voiceless labiodental fricative |
| х | /x/ | Voiceless velar fricative |
| ц | /ts/ | Voiceless alveolar affricate |
| ч | /tʃ/ | Voiceless postalveolar affricate |
| ш | /ʃ/ | Voiceless postalveolar fricative |

Palatalized consonants were not represented by separate letters but were indicated by the following vowel (e.g., **и**, **ь**).

Example:
- **чловѣкъ** (člověkŭ) [tʃlovækŭ] “human”

### Prosody

Old Church Slavonic likely had a pitch accent system inherited from Proto-Slavic, but the exact nature of this system is debated among scholars. The manuscripts do not consistently mark stress or pitch.

## Morphology

Old Church Slavonic had a highly inflected grammar, with complex systems for nouns, adjectives, and verbs.

### Nouns

Nouns in OCS were declined for three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), three numbers (singular, dual, plural), and seven cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, vocative).

Example declension of **рабъ** (rabŭ) “slave” (masculine o-stem):

| Case | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| Nom. | **рабъ** | **раба** | **раби** |
| Acc. | **рабъ** | **раба** | **рабꙑ** |
| Gen. | **раба** | **рабоу** | **рабъ** |
| Dat. | **рабоу** | **рабома** | **рабомъ** |
| Ins. | **рабомь** | **рабома** | **рабꙑ** |
| Loc. | **рабѣ** | **рабоу** | **рабѣхъ** |
| Voc. | **рабе** | **раба** | **раби** |

### Adjectives

Adjectives had two forms: short (nominal) and long (pronominal). They agreed with nouns in gender, number, and case.

Example of short form declension for **добръ** (dobrŭ) “good” (masculine):

| Case | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| Nom. | **добръ** | **добра** | **добри** |
| Acc. | **добръ** | **добра** | **добрꙑ** |
| Gen. | **добра** | **доброу** | **добръ** |
| Dat. | **доброу** | **доброма** | **добромъ** |
| Ins. | **добромь** | **доброма** | **добрꙑ** |
| Loc. | **добрѣ** | **доброу** | **добрѣхъ** |

Long form adjectives were formed by adding the relative pronoun **и** (i) to the short form.

### Pronouns

OCS had personal, demonstrative, relative, and interrogative pronouns. Personal pronouns were declined for case but not gender in the first and second persons.

Example of personal pronoun declension for “I” and “you” (singular):

| Case | 1st Person | 2nd Person |
|------|------------|------------|
| Nom. | **азъ** | **тꙑ** |
| Acc. | **мѧ**, **мене** | **тѧ**, **тебе** |
| Gen. | **мене** | **тебе** |
| Dat. | **мьнѣ**, **ми** | **тебѣ**, **ти** |
| Ins. | **мъноѭ** | **тобоѭ** |
| Loc. | **мьнѣ** | **тебѣ** |

### Verbs

The OCS verb system was complex, with verbs conjugated for person, number, tense, mood, and voice. There were also participles and verbal nouns.

#### Present Tense

Example conjugation of **нести** (nesti) “to carry” in the present tense:

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **несѫ** | **несевѣ** | **несемъ** |
| 2nd | **несеши** | **несета** | **несете** |
| 3rd | **несетъ** | **несете** | **несѫтъ** |

#### Aorist

The aorist was used for completed past actions. There were three types: simple, sigmatic first, and sigmatic second.

Example of sigmatic first aorist for **рещи** (rešti) “to say”:

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **рѣхъ** | **рѣховѣ** | **рѣхомъ** |
| 2nd | **рече** | **рѣста** | **рѣсте** |
| 3rd | **рече** | **рѣсте** | **рѣшѧ** |

#### Imperfect

The imperfect expressed continuous or habitual past actions.

Example of imperfect for **нести** (nesti) “to carry”:

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 1st | **несѣахъ** | **несѣаховѣ** | **несѣахомъ** |
| 2nd | **несѣаше** | **несѣашета** | **несѣашете** |
| 3rd | **несѣаше** | **несѣашете** | **несѣахѫ** |

#### Perfect

The perfect was formed using the present tense of the auxiliary verb **бꙑти** (byti) “to be” and the resultative participle (l-participle) of the main verb.

Example: **неслъ есмь** (neslŭ jesmĭ) “I have carried”

#### Pluperfect

The pluperfect was formed using the imperfect of **бꙑти** (byti) and the resultative participle.

Example: **неслъ бѣахъ** (neslŭ běaxŭ) “I had carried”

#### Future

The future was typically expressed using the present tense of perfective verbs. For imperfective verbs, periphrastic constructions with auxiliaries like **хотѣти** (xotěti) “to want” or **начѧти** (načęti) “to begin” were used.

Example: **хощѫ нести** (xoštǫ nesti) “I will carry”

#### Conditional

The conditional was formed using the aorist of **бꙑти** (byti) and the resultative participle.

Example: **неслъ бимь** (neslŭ bimĭ) “I would carry”

#### Imperative

The imperative was formed from the present stem.

Example of imperative for **нести** (nesti) “to carry”:

| Person | Singular | Dual | Plural |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 2nd | **неси** | **несѣта** | **несѣте** |
| 3rd | **неси** | **несѣте** | **несѣте** |

#### Participles

OCS had several participles:

1. Present active: **несꙑ** (nesy) “carrying”
2. Present passive: **несомъ** (nesomŭ) “being carried”
3. Past active: **несъ** (nesŭ) “having carried”
4. Past passive: **несенъ** (nesenŭ) “having been carried”
5. Resultative (l-participle): **неслъ** (neslŭ) “carried”

#### Infinitive and Supine

The infinitive ended in **-ти** (-ti): **нести** (nesti) “to carry”
The supine, used with verbs of motion, ended in **-тъ** (-tŭ): **нестъ** (nestŭ) “(in order) to carry”

## Syntax

### Word Order

Old Church Slavonic had a relatively free word order due to its extensive case system. However, the most common order was Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).

Example:
**Богъ миръ сътвори** (Bogŭ mirŭ sŭtvori)
“God created the world”

### Negation

Negation was expressed by the particle **не** (ne) placed before the verb.

Example:
**Не вѣмь** (Ne věmĭ)
“I do not know”

### Questions

Questions were formed by intonation or by using interrogative pronouns or particles.

Example:
**Къто еси?** (Kŭto jesi?)
“Who are you?”

### Subordinate Clauses

Subordinate clauses were often introduced by conjunctions such as **ꙗко** (jako) “that, because” or **да** (da) “in order to, that”.

Example:
**Вѣмь ꙗко истина естъ** (Věmĭ jako istina jestŭ)
“I know that it is true”

### Dual Number

OCS retained the Indo-European dual number, used for pairs of objects or people.

Example:
**Два чловѣка** (Dŭva člověka)
“Two people”

### Dative Absolute

The dative absolute construction was used to express a subordinate adverbial clause, similar to the ablative absolute in Latin.

Example:
**Слъньцоу въсходѧщоу, пътицѧ поѭтъ** (Slŭnĭcou vŭsxodęštou, pŭticę pojǫtŭ)
“When the sun rises, the birds sing”

## Vocabulary

Old Church Slavonic vocabulary was primarily Slavic in origin, with some loanwords from Greek due to the language's use in translating Byzantine religious texts.

### Native Slavic Words

- **богъ** (bogŭ) “god”
- **чловѣкъ** (člověkŭ) “human, person”
- **земл҄ꙗ** (zemlja) “earth, land”
- **небо** (nebo) “sky, heaven”
- **вода** (voda) “water”
- **огнь** (ognĭ) “fire”
- **дрѣво** (drěvo) “tree”
- **рѫка** (rǫka) “hand”
- **глава** (glava) “head”
- **срьдьце** (srĭdĭce) “heart”

### Greek Loanwords

- **демонъ** (demonŭ) “demon” (from Greek δαίμων)
- **икона** (ikona) “icon” (from Greek εἰκών)

### Word Formation

Old Church Slavonic had a rich system of word formation, including prefixation, suffixation, and compounding.

#### Prefixation

Prefixes were commonly used to modify the meaning of verbs and nouns. Some common prefixes include:

- **въ-** (vŭ-) “in, into”: **въити** (vŭiti) “to enter” from **ити** (iti) “to go”
- **из-** (iz-) “out, from”: **изити** (iziti) “to exit” from **ити** (iti) “to go”
- **на-** (na-) “on, onto”: **написати** (napisati) “to write down” from **писати** (pisati) “to write”
- **отъ-** (otŭ-) “away, from”: **отъити** (otŭiti) “to go away” from **ити** (iti) “to go”
- **прѣ-** (prě-) “over, across”: **прѣити** (prěiti) “to cross over” from **ити** (iti) “to go”

#### Suffixation

Suffixes were used to derive new words and change grammatical categories. Some examples include:

- **-ьникъ** (-ĭnikŭ) to form agent nouns: **грѣшьникъ** (grěšĭnikŭ) “sinner” from **грѣхъ** (grěxŭ) “sin”
- **-ьство** (-ĭstvo) to form abstract nouns: **цѣсарьство** (cěsarĭstvo) “kingdom” from **цѣсарь** (cěsarĭ) “emperor”
- **-ьнъ** (-ĭnŭ) to form adjectives: **небесьнъ** (nebesĭnŭ) “heavenly” from **небо** (nebo) “sky, heaven”
- **-ати** (-ati) to form imperfective verbs: **дѣлати** (dělati) “to do, make” from **дѣло** (dělo) “deed, work”

#### Compounding

Compound words were formed by combining two or more stems:

- **благо-** (blago-) “good” + **дать** (datĭ) “to give” → **благодать** (blagodatĭ) “grace”
- **бого-** (bogo-) “god” + **родица** (rodica) “bearer” → **богородица** (bogorodica) “Mother of God”
- **мило-** (milo-) “mercy” + **срьдъ** (srĭdŭ) “heart” → **милосрьдъ** (milosrĭdŭ) “merciful”

## Dialectal Variation

While Old Church Slavonic was initially based on the Slavic dialect of Thessalonica, it evolved into different recensions as it spread across Slavic lands. The main recensions include:

1. Bulgarian Recension: Preserved many archaic features, including nasal vowels.
   Example: **пѧть** (pętĭ) “five” retained as [pɛ̃tĭ]

2. Serbian Recension: Lost nasal vowels and merged yers.
   Example: **пѧть** (pętĭ) “five” became **петь** (petĭ) [petĭ]

3. Russian Recension: Lost nasal vowels, had unique treatment of yers.
   Example: **сънъ** (sŭnŭ) “dream” became **сонъ** (sonŭ) [son]

4. Croatian Recension: Preserved in Glagolitic tradition, had some Western Slavic features.
   Example: **мьша** (mĭša) “mass” instead of **литоургиꙗ** (litourgija)

## Syntax (continued)

### Clitic Placement

Old Church Slavonic had a system of clitic pronouns and particles that followed specific ordering rules. These clitics typically appeared in the second position in a clause (Wackernagel's law).

Example:
**Видѣлъ ли еси его?** (Viděl li jesi jego?)
“Have you seen him?”
Here, **ли** (li) is an interrogative particle clitic, and **еси** (jesi) is a clitic form of the verb “to be”.

### Reflexive Constructions

The reflexive pronoun **сѧ** (sę) was used to form reflexive and middle voice constructions.

Example:
**Облѣче сѧ въ ризѫ** (Oblěče sę vŭ rizǫ)
“He dressed himself in a robe”

### Passive Voice

Passive constructions were formed using the passive participle and forms of the verb **бꙑти** (byti) “to be”.

Example:
**Мирь дань естъ имъ** (Mirĭ danĭ jestŭ imŭ)
“Peace is given to them”

### Impersonal Constructions

Impersonal constructions were common, often using the 3rd person singular neuter form of verbs.

Example:
**Подобаетъ чловѣкоу молити сѧ** (Podobajetŭ člověkou moliti sę)
“It is proper for a person to pray”

## Lexical Semantics

### Semantic Fields

Old Church Slavonic vocabulary was particularly rich in certain semantic fields, reflecting its primary use in religious texts:

1. Religious terminology:
   - **благодѣть** (blagodětĭ) “grace”
   - **грѣхъ** (grěxŭ) “sin”
   - **покаꙗниѥ** (pokajanije) “repentance”
   - **съпасениѥ** (sŭpasenije) “salvation”

2. Abstract concepts:
   - **истина** (istina) “truth”
   - **любꙑ** (ljuby) “love”
   - **мѫдрость** (mǫdrostĭ) “wisdom”
   - **правьда** (pravĭda) “justice, righteousness”

3. Natural world:
   - **слъньце** (slŭnĭce) “sun”
   - **мѣсѧць** (měsęcĭ) “moon”
   - **звѣзда** (zvězda) “star”
   - **море** (more) “sea”

### Polysemy

Many Old Church Slavonic words had multiple related meanings. For example:

- **слово** (slovo):
  1. “word”
  2. “speech”
  3. “reason”
  4. “(the) Word” (in theological context, referring to Christ)

- **миръ** (mirŭ):
  1. “peace”
  2. “world”

### Synonymy

OCS often had multiple words for important concepts, allowing for nuanced expression:

- “to know”:
  1. **вѣдѣти** (věděti) - to know a fact
  2. **знати** (znati) - to be acquainted with
  3. **оумѣти** (ouměti) - to know how to do something

- “to say”:
  1. **глаголати** (glagolati) - to speak (more formal)
  2. **рещи** (rešti) - to say (perfective)
  3. **бесѣдовати** (besědovati) - to converse

## Phraseology

Old Church Slavonic had many set phrases and expressions, often calqued from Greek:

- **Отьче нашь** (Otĭče našĭ) - “Our Father” (beginning of the Lord's Prayer)
- **Тако бѫди** (Tako bǫdi) - “So be it” (equivalent to “Amen”)
- **Рабъ божии** (Rabŭ božii) - “Servant of God”
- **Царьство небесьное** (Carĭstvo nebesĭnoje) - “Kingdom of Heaven”

## Text Sample

Here's a sample text in Old Church Slavonic, the beginning of the Gospel of John (1:1-3):

**Искони бѣ слово · и слово бѣ отъ бога · и богъ бѣ слово · се бѣ искони отъ бога · вьсѣ тѣмь бꙑшѧ · и без него ничьтоже не бꙑстъ еже бꙑстъ ·**

Transliteration:
Iskoni bě slovo · i slovo bě otŭ boga · i bogŭ bě slovo · se bě iskoni otŭ boga · vĭsě těmĭ byšę · i bez nego ničĭtože ne bystŭ ježe bystŭ ·

Translation:
“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.”

This passage demonstrates several features of Old Church Slavonic:
- Use of the imperfect tense (**бѣ** - bě)
- Lack of articles
- SOV word order (e.g., **слово бѣ отъ бога** - slovo bě otŭ boga)
- Use of the instrumental case (**тѣмь** - těmĭ)
- Negative construction (**ничьтоже не бꙑстъ** - ničĭtože ne bystŭ)

## Influence on Modern Slavic Languages

Old Church Slavonic had a profound influence on the development of many modern Slavic languages, particularly in their literary and religious vocabularies. Some examples:

1. Russian:
   - OCS **глава** (glava) “head” → Russian **голова** (golova)
   - OCS **младъ** (mladŭ) “young” → Russian **молодой** (molodoy)

2. Bulgarian:
   - OCS **врѣмѧ** (vrěmę) “time” → Bulgarian **време** (vreme)
   - OCS **дрѣво** (drěvo) “tree” → Bulgarian **дърво** (darvo)

3. Serbian:
   - OCS **чловѣкъ** (člověkŭ) “human” → Serbian **човек** (čovek)
   - OCS **млѣко** (mlěko) “milk” → Serbian **млеко** (mleko)

4. Czech:
   - OCS **срьдьце** (srĭdĭce) “heart” → Czech **srdce**
   - OCS **власть** (vlastĭ) “power” → Czech **vlast** “homeland”

The influence of OCS is particularly noticeable in the Church Slavonic language, which is still used in Orthodox liturgy and continues to influence the formal and poetic registers of many Slavic languages.
