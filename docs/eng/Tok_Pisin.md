# Tok Pisin

Tok Pisin is an English-based creole language that serves as a lingua franca in Papua New Guinea. It is one of the country's official languages, alongside English and Hiri Motu. Tok Pisin evolved from a pidgin used in plantations and trade during the 19th century, gradually developing into a creole as it became the first language for many speakers.

## Historical Development

Tok Pisin's roots can be traced back to the 19th century when Papua New Guinea was colonized by various European powers. The language emerged from the need for communication between the colonizers and the local population, as well as among the diverse indigenous groups themselves.

1. Early Pidgin Stage (1800s-1900s):
   - Initial contact language developed in plantations and trading posts
   - Heavily influenced by English, German, and local Austronesian languages

2. Stabilization (1920s-1940s):
   - Increased use as a lingua franca among different linguistic groups
   - Standardization of basic vocabulary and grammar

3. Creolization (1950s-present):
   - Tok Pisin becomes the first language for many urban residents
   - Expansion of vocabulary and grammatical complexity

4. Official Recognition:
   - 1975: Papua New Guinea gains independence
   - Tok Pisin recognized as one of the country's official languages

Translation:
Long, long ago, there was an old woman living in a small village. This woman had no children and lived all alone. One day, when she went to her garden, she heard a noise coming from the forest. She went to look and found a small child. This child had no parents. The old woman took the child to her house and cared for it as if it were her own child.

When the child grew a little bigger, he used to help the old woman with all the work. They lived very well together. But one time, when the child went to the forest to find firewood, he met an evil spirit. This spirit wanted to eat the child, but the child was stronger. He beat the evil spirit and ran away back to the village.

The old woman heard the child's story and said, “You must be very careful in the forest. There are many evil spirits there.” After this, the child grew into a very strong man and took very good care of the old woman until she died.

Translation:
My name is Jack, and I want to tell the story of my first time going to a big city. I grew up in a small village in the bush, and I hadn't seen many city things before. When I arrived in Port Moresby, my eyes were wide open. I saw very tall buildings, many cars running on the road, and many people walking quickly.

The first thing I did was go to a big store. All kinds of things were inside, and I didn't know where to look. I bought an ice cream, and it was very sweet. After that, I went to the beach and saw the ocean. It was very different from our water in the village.

In the evening, I went to my cousin's house. He had been living there for a long time. He showed me many things about the city and taught me about the way of life there. I was very happy about my trip, but I was also tired of the big noise and many people. I think that my place in the bush is good too, because it's easy and there isn’t much noise.
