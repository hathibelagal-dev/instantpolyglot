# Turkish

Turkish is a Turkic language spoken by approximately 88 million people, primarily in Turkey and Northern Cyprus. It's also spoken by significant minority communities in countries such as Germany, Bulgaria, and Macedonia. Turkish is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, which include Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Kazakh, and Uzbek, among others.

## Spelling and pronunciation

Turkish uses a Latin-based alphabet consisting of 29 letters, introduced in 1928 as part of Atatürk's reforms to modernize the country. The alphabet is largely phonetic, meaning that words are generally pronounced as they are spelled, with each letter corresponding to a single sound.

### Vowels

Turkish has 8 vowels:

| Letter | Sound | IPA |
|--------|-------|-----|
| a | as in "father" | [a] |
| e | as in "bed" | [e] |
| ı | similar to the second vowel in "roses" | [ɯ] |
| i | as in "meet" | [i] |
| o | as in "door" | [o] |
| ö | as in German "schön" | [ø] |
| u | as in "boot" | [u] |
| ü | as in German "über" | [y] |

Turkish vowels are characterized by vowel harmony, a crucial feature of the language that we'll discuss in more detail later.

### Consonants

Turkish has 21 consonants:

| Letter | Sound | IPA |
|--------|-------|-----|
| b | as in "bed" | [b] |
| c | as in "jam" | [dʒ] |
| ç | as in "church" | [tʃ] |
| d | as in "door" | [d] |
| f | as in "father" | [f] |
| g | as in "go" | [ɡ] |
| ğ | silent, lengthens preceding vowel | - |
| h | as in "hope" | [h] |
| j | as in "measure" | [ʒ] |
| k | as in "key" | [k] |
| l | as in "love" | [l] |
| m | as in "mother" | [m] |
| n | as in "no" | [n] |
| p | as in "pen" | [p] |
| r | rolled, as in Spanish | [r] |
| s | as in "sun" | [s] |
| ş | as in "ship" | [ʃ] |
| t | as in "tea" | [t] |
| v | as in "voice" | [v] |
| y | as in "yes" | [j] |
| z | as in "zebra" | [z] |

### Stress

In Turkish, stress typically falls on the last syllable of a word. However, there are exceptions:

1. Place names often have stress on the first syllable: **'Ankara**, **'İstanbul**.
2. Some loan words maintain their original stress: **'telefon** (telephone), **'lüks** (luxury).
3. Some suffixes do not take stress, keeping it on the last syllable of the root word:
   - The question particle **mı/mi/mu/mü**: **geli'yor mu?** (Is he/she coming?)
   - The negative suffix **-me/-ma**: **'gelme** (don't come)
   - Some adverbial suffixes: **'hızlıca** (quickly)

### Notable pronunciation features

1. The letter ğ (soft g):
   This letter is silent but lengthens the preceding vowel. For example, **dağ** (mountain) is pronounced like [da:].

2. Final devoicing:
   Voiced consonants (b, c, d, g) at the end of words are often pronounced as their voiceless counterparts (p, ç, t, k). For example, **kitap** (book) is spelled with a 'p' but its plural form is **kitablar**, revealing the underlying 'b'.

3. Palatalization:
   The consonants k, g, and l are often palatalized (softened) when followed by front vowels (e, i, ö, ü). For example, the 'k' in **keçi** (goat) is softer than the 'k' in **karpuz** (watermelon).

## Morphology

Turkish is an agglutinative language, meaning that complex words are formed by adding suffixes to a root word. This feature allows for the creation of very long words that express complex ideas concisely.

### Nouns

Turkish nouns are relatively simple compared to many other languages. They do not have grammatical gender, and there's no need for articles (like "the" or "a" in English).

#### Cases

Turkish has six main cases:

1. Nominative (no suffix): **ev** (house)
2. Accusative (-i/ı/u/ü): **evi** (the house, as a direct object)
3. Dative (-e/a): **eve** (to the house)
4. Locative (-de/da): **evde** (in the house)
5. Ablative (-den/dan): **evden** (from the house)
6. Genitive (-in/ın/un/ün): **evin** (of the house)

The exact form of the suffix depends on vowel harmony and consonant assimilation rules.

Examples:
- **Ev güzel.** (The house is beautiful.) - Nominative
- **Evi gördüm.** (I saw the house.) - Accusative
- **Eve gidiyorum.** (I'm going to the house.) - Dative
- **Evde kalıyorum.** (I'm staying in the house.) - Locative
- **Evden çıktım.** (I left from the house.) - Ablative
- **Evin rengi beyaz.** (The color of the house is white.) - Genitive

#### Plurals

The plural suffix in Turkish is -ler/lar, with the choice between -ler and -lar depending on vowel harmony:

- **ev** (house) → **evler** (houses)
- **araba** (car) → **arabalar** (cars)

#### Possessive suffixes

Possession is indicated by suffixes added to the noun:

- **-im/ım/um/üm** (my): **evim** (my house)
- **-in/ın/un/ün** (your, singular): **evin** (your house)
- **-i/ı/u/ü** (his/her/its): **evi** (his/her/its house)
- **-imiz/ımız/umuz/ümüz** (our): **evimiz** (our house)
- **-iniz/ınız/unuz/ünüz** (your, plural): **eviniz** (your house)
- **-leri/ları** (their): **evleri** (their house)

Examples:
- **Bu benim kitabım.** (This is my book.)
- **Onun arabası kırmızı.** (His/her car is red.)
- **Bizim evimiz büyük.** (Our house is big.)

### Adjectives

Turkish adjectives are invariable; they do not change for number or case. They typically precede the noun they modify:

- **büyük ev** (big house)
- **büyük evler** (big houses)
- **büyük eve** (to the big house)

Adjectives can also be used as nouns by adding suffixes:
- **güzel** (beautiful) → **güzellik** (beauty)
- **iyi** (good) → **iyilik** (goodness)

Comparatives and superlatives:
- Comparative: **daha** + adjective
  Example: **Bu ev daha büyük.** (This house is bigger.)
- Superlative: **en** + adjective
  Example: **Bu en büyük ev.** (This is the biggest house.)

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns in Turkish are:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st    | ben (I)  | biz (we) |
| 2nd    | sen (you) | siz (you) |
| 3rd    | o (he/she/it) | onlar (they) |

These pronouns change form when used in different cases:

| Case | ben | sen | o | biz | siz | onlar |
|------|-----|-----|---|-----|-----|-------|
| Nominative | ben | sen | o | biz | siz | onlar |
| Accusative | beni | seni | onu | bizi | sizi | onları |
| Dative | bana | sana | ona | bize | size | onlara |
| Locative | bende | sende | onda | bizde | sizde | onlarda |
| Ablative | benden | senden | ondan | bizden | sizden | onlardan |
| Genitive | benim | senin | onun | bizim | sizin | onların |

Examples:
- **Ben Türkçe öğreniyorum.** (I am learning Turkish.)
- **Bana bir mektup gönderdi.** (He/she sent me a letter.)
- **Onların evinde kaldık.** (We stayed at their house.)

Demonstrative pronouns:
- **bu** (this)
- **şu** (that, for objects that are closer)
- **o** (that, for objects that are farther away)

These also decline for case:
- **bu kitap** (this book)
- **şu adamı gördün mü?** (did you see that man?)
- **o ağacın altında** (under that tree)

### Numbers

Turkish cardinal numbers:

- 0 - **sıfır**
- 1 - **bir**
- 2 - **iki**
- 3 - **üç**
- 4 - **dört**
- 5 - **beş**
- 6 - **altı**
- 7 - **yedi**
- 8 - **sekiz**
- 9 - **dokuz**
- 10 - **on**
- 20 - **yirmi**
- 30 - **otuz**
- 40 - **kırk**

- 70 - **yetmiş**
- 80 - **seksen**
- 90 - **doksan**
- 100 - **yüz**
- 1000 - **bin**

Larger numbers are formed by combining these:
- 21 - **yirmi bir**
- 135 - **yüz otuz beş**
- 1984 - **bin dokuz yüz seksen dört**

Ordinal numbers are formed by adding the suffix -inci/ıncı/uncu/üncü:
- 1st - **birinci**
- 2nd - **ikinci**
- 3rd - **üçüncü**
- 4th - **dördüncü**

When using numbers with nouns, the noun remains in the singular form:
- **üç elma** (three apples, literally "three apple")
- **on kitap** (ten books, literally "ten book")

### Verbs

Turkish verbs are complex and can express a wealth of information through suffixes. The verb stem typically comes first, followed by various suffixes indicating tense, aspect, mood, and person.

#### Infinitive

The infinitive form of verbs ends in -mek or -mak:
- **gelmek** (to come)
- **gitmek** (to go)
- **yapmak** (to do/make)
- **konuşmak** (to speak)

#### Present tense

The simple present tense is formed by adding -r/-ar/-er to the verb stem, followed by personal endings:

**gelmek** (to come):
- **gelirim** (I come)
- **gelirsin** (you come)
- **gelir** (he/she/it comes)

- **gelecek** (he/she/it will come)
- **geleceğiz** (we will come)

- **gelecekler** (they will come)

#### Imperative

The imperative mood in Turkish has different forms for singular and plural:

Singular (informal):
- **gel** (come!)
- **git** (go!)

Plural or formal singular:
- **gelin** (come!)
- **gidin** (go!)

#### Negation

Verbs are negated by inserting the suffix -me/-ma after the verb stem:

- **gelmek** (to come) → **gelmemek** (not to come)
- **geliyorum** (I am coming) → **gelmiyorum** (I am not coming)
- **geldim** (I came) → **gelmedim** (I didn't come)

#### Question form

Questions are formed by adding the particle **mi/mı/mu/mü** after the verb:

- **Geliyor musun?** (Are you coming?)
- **Yaptın mı?** (Did you do it?)

#### Ability

The ability to do something is expressed with the suffix -ebil/-abil:

- **görebilmek** (to be able to see)
- **yapabilmek** (to be able to do)

Examples:

- **Yarın gelebilir misin?** (Can you come tomorrow?)

#### Necessity

Necessity is expressed with the suffix -meli/-malı:

- **gitmeliyim** (I must go)
- **çalışmalısın** (you must work)

Example:

### Participles

Turkish has several participle forms:

1. Present participle (-en/-an):
   - **gelen adam** (the man who is coming)
   - **okuyan çocuk** (the child who is reading)

2. Past participle (-miş/-mış/-muş/-müş):
   - **gelmiş mektup** (the letter that has come)
   - **pişmiş yemek** (cooked food)

3. Future participle (-ecek/-acak):
   - **gelecek hafta** (next week, literally "the week that will come")
   - **yapılacak iş** (the work to be done)

4. Habitual participle (-er/-ar):
   - **güler yüz** (smiling face, literally "face that smiles")
   - **akar su** (running water, literally "water that flows")

### Gerunds

Turkish has several gerund forms that allow verbs to function as nouns:

1. -mek/-mak (infinitive used as a noun):
   - **Yüzmek sağlıklıdır.** (Swimming is healthy.)

2. -me/-ma:
   - **Erken kalkma alışkanlığı** (The habit of waking up early)

   - **geldiğimi biliyorum** (I know that I came)

5. -eceği/-acağı (for future actions):
   - **geleceğini söyledi** (He said that he would come)

### Postpositions

Unlike many European languages that use prepositions, Turkish uses postpositions. These come after the word they modify:

- **ev için** (for the house)
- **benden sonra** (after me)
- **senin gibi** (like you)
- **okula doğru** (towards the school)

Some postpositions require the noun to be in a specific case:

- **eve kadar** (up to the house) - requires dative case
- **evden beri** (since [leaving] the house) - requires ablative case

Examples:
- **Toplantıdan sonra eve gideceğim.** (I will go home after the meeting.)
- **Senin için bu kitabı aldım.** (I bought this book for you.)

### Conjunctions

Turkish has several conjunctions that connect words, phrases, or clauses:

- **ve** (and): **elma ve armut** (apple and pear)
- **ama** (but): **Geldi ama erken gitti.** (He came but left early.)
- **veya** / **ya da** (or): **çay veya kahve** (tea or coffee)
- **çünkü** (because): **Gelmedi çünkü hastaydı.** (He didn't come because he was sick.)
- **eğer** (if): **Eğer yağmur yağarsa, evde kalacağım.** (If it rains, I'll stay at home.)

### Word order

The basic word order in Turkish is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV):

**Ben elma yiyorum.** (I am eating an apple.)
Subject (Ben) - Object (elma) - Verb (yiyorum)

However, Turkish word order is relatively flexible due to its case system. The verb typically comes at the end of the sentence, but other elements can be moved for emphasis:

- **Elma yiyorum ben.** (It's an apple that I'm eating.)
- **Yiyorum ben elmayı.** (I am indeed eating the apple.)

In questions, the question word typically comes immediately before the verb:

**Sen ne yapıyorsun?** (What are you doing?)

### Vowel harmony

Vowel harmony is a key feature of Turkish phonology and morphology. It requires that vowels in suffixes agree with the vowels in the root word. There are two types of vowel harmony in Turkish:

1. Two-fold vowel harmony (e-a harmony):
   - If the last vowel in the root is e, i, ö, or ü, use e in the suffix.
   - If the last vowel in the root is a, ı, o, or u, use a in the suffix.

   Examples:
   - **ev** + **de** = **evde** (in the house)
   - **kitap** + **ta** = **kitapta** (in the book)

2. Four-fold vowel harmony (i-ı-u-ü harmony):
   - If the last vowel in the root is i or e, use i in the suffix.
   - If the last vowel in the root is ı or a, use ı in the suffix.
   - If the last vowel in the root is u or o, use u in the suffix.
   - If the last vowel in the root is ü or ö, use ü in the suffix.

   Examples:
   - **gelir** + **im** = **gelirim** (I come)
   - **yapar** + **ım** = **yaparım** (I do)
   - **olur** + **um** = **olurum** (I become)
   - **görür** + **üm** = **görürüm** (I see)

Vowel harmony applies to most suffixes in Turkish, including case endings, verb tenses, and plurals.

### Consonant assimilation

In addition to vowel harmony, Turkish also exhibits consonant assimilation. This means that certain consonants change when they come into contact with other consonants. The most common type is voicing assimilation:

- The suffixes -de/-da, -den/-dan, and -di/-dı/-du/-dü change to -te/-ta, -ten/-tan, and -ti/-tı/-tu/-tü after unvoiced consonants (p, ç, t, k, s, ş, h, f):

  Examples:
  - **kitap** + **da** = **kitapta** (in the book)
  - **ağaç** + **tan** = **ağaçtan** (from the tree)
  - **yapmak** + **tı** = **yaptı** (he/she did)

### Honorifics and politeness

Turkish has a complex system of honorifics and politeness markers:

1. Second person plural pronoun **siz** is used as a formal "you" for singular addressees:
   - **Nasılsınız?** (How are you? - formal)
   - **Nasılsın?** (How are you? - informal)

2. Titles are commonly used with names:
   - **Ayşe Hanım** (Mrs./Ms. Ayşe)
   - **Mehmet Bey** (Mr. Mehmet)

3. Professional titles are used frequently:
   - **Doktor Bey/Hanım** (Doctor)
   - **Hocam** (My teacher/professor)

4. The suffix -Dir/-Dır/-Dur/-Dür is used to soften statements:
   - **Ev güzeldir.** (The house is beautiful. - more polite)
   - **Ev güzel.** (The house is beautiful. - more direct)

### Reduplication

Turkish uses reduplication to intensify adjectives and adverbs:

1. Full reduplication:
   - **yavaş yavaş** (very slowly, literally "slow slow")
   - **hızlı hızlı** (very quickly, literally "quick quick")

2. Partial reduplication with m-:
   - **kırmızı** (red) → **kıpkırmızı** (bright red)
   - **siyah** (black) → **simsiyah** (pitch black)

### Compounds

Turkish forms compounds in several ways:

1. Simple juxtaposition:
   - **demir yolu** (railroad, literally "iron road")
   - **çaydanlık** (teapot, from **çay** "tea" + **-dan** "container" + **-lık** "device for")

2. With the compound marker -(s)i:
   - **Türk kahvesi** (Turkish coffee)
   - **çocuk bahçesi** (kindergarten, literally "child garden")

### Idioms and expressions

Turkish has many colorful idioms and expressions:

- **Gözden düşmek** (to fall from favor, literally "to fall from the eye")
- **Kulak kabartmak** (to eavesdrop, literally "to raise one's ear")
- **Ağzı kulaklarına varmak** (to be very happy, literally "one's mouth reaches one's ears")
- **Etekleri zil çalmak** (to be very excited, literally "one's skirts ring bells")

### Loanwords

Turkish has borrowed words from various languages throughout its history:

1. Arabic and Persian:
   - **kitap** (book, from Arabic)
   - **dost** (friend, from Persian)

2. French:
   - **kuaför** (hairdresser, from French "coiffeur")
   - **pantolon** (trousers, from French "pantalon")

3. Italian:
   - **gazete** (newspaper, from Italian "gazzetta")
   - **palyaço** (clown, from Italian "pagliaccio")

4. English (more recent borrowings):
   - **bilgisayar** (computer, a Turkish neologism meaning "information counter")
   - **internet** (internet)

### Colloquial Turkish

Colloquial Turkish often differs from the standard written language:

1. Contractions:
   - **ne yapıyorsun** → **napıyorsun** (what are you doing?)
   - **bir şey** → **bişey** (something)

2. Particle usage:
   - **ya** as a filler or for emphasis: **Gelsene ya!** (Come on!)
   - **işte** for emphasis or explanation: **İşte böyle.** (That's how it is.)

3. Informal pronouns:
   - **kanka** (buddy, close friend)
   - **hacı** (literally "pilgrim," used informally like "dude")

4. Slang:
   - **cool** → **havalı**
   - **yavşak** (sleazy person)

### Regional variations

While Turkish is relatively uniform across Turkey, there are some regional variations:

1. Istanbul Turkish is considered the standard form.

2. Black Sea dialect:
   - Uses different verb endings: **geliyerum** instead of **geliyorum** (I am coming)
   - Has a distinct accent and intonation

3. Eastern Anatolian dialect:
   - Often drops the future tense marker: **gelecek** → **gele** (he/she will come)
   - Uses some different vocabulary items

4. Aegean dialect:
   - Often softens the "k" sound to "g": **kalk** → **kalg** (stand up)
   - Has a more melodic intonation

### Writing system

Modern Turkish uses a Latin-based alphabet introduced in 1928, replacing the Ottoman Turkish alphabet based on Arabic script. The Turkish alphabet consists of 29 letters:

a, b, c, ç, d, e, f, g, ğ, h, ı, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, ö, p, r, s, ş, t, u, ü, v, y, z

Note the additional letters ç, ğ, ı, ö, ş, and ü, which represent sounds specific to Turkish.

Capitalization rules in Turkish are similar to English, with some exceptions:

- Days of the week and months are not capitalized: **pazartesi** (Monday), **ocak** (January)
- Languages and nationalities are not capitalized: **türkçe** (Turkish language), **fransız** (French person)

Punctuation in Turkish is generally similar to English, with a few differences:

- Quotation marks: „ " or " " (both forms are acceptable)
- Apostrophes are used to separate proper nouns from suffixes: **Türkiye'de** (in Turkey)
