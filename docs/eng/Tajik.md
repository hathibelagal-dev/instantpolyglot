# Tajik

Tajik (тоҷикӣ, tojikī) is an Indo-European language belonging to the Persian branch of the Iranian language family. It is the official language of Tajikistan and is also spoken in parts of Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. Tajik is closely related to Persian (Farsi) and Dari, with which it shares much of its vocabulary and grammar.

## Writing System

Tajik uses a modified version of the Cyrillic alphabet, which was introduced during the Soviet era. Previously, it used the Arabic script, and there have been efforts to reintroduce a modified Persian-Arabic script in recent years.

## Morphology

### Nouns

Tajik nouns have the following characteristics:

1. No grammatical gender
2. Two numbers: singular and plural
3. No case system (uses prepositions and word order instead)

#### Plural Formation

The most common plural suffix is **-ҳо** (-ho):
- **китоб** (kitob) “book” → **китобҳо** (kitobho) “books”
- **хона** (khona) “house” → **хонаҳо** (khonaho) “houses”

Some Arabic loanwords use the suffix **-он** (-on):
- **муаллим** (muallim) “teacher” → **муаллимон** (muallimon) “teachers”

#### Definite and Indefinite Articles

Tajik doesn’t have articles, but definiteness can be expressed through:

1. The suffix **-е** (-e) for indefiniteness:
   **китобе** (kitobe) “a book”

2. The demonstrative adjectives **ин** (in) “this” and **он** (on) “that” for definiteness:
   **ин китоб** (in kitob) “this book” / “the book”

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Tajik usually precede the noun they modify and do not agree in number:

**хуб** (khub) “good”:
- **китоби хуб** (kitobi khub) “good book”
- **китобҳои хуб** (kitobhoi khub) “good books”

Comparative and superlative forms:

1. Comparative: prefix **-тар** (-tar)
   **хуб** (khub) “good” → **хубтар** (khubtar) “better”

2. Superlative: prefix **бе-** (be-) or phrases like **аз ҳама** (az hama) “of all”
   **беҳтарин** (behtarin) “best”
   **аз ҳама хуб** (az hama khub) “the best”

### Pronouns

#### Personal Pronouns

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|

| 2nd | **ту** (tu) | **шумо** (shumo) |
| 3rd | **ӯ** (u) | **онҳо** (onho) |

The pronoun **шумо** (shumo) is also used as the formal “you” (singular).

### Verbs

Tajik verbs are complex and have the following characteristics:

1. Two stems: present and past
2. Person and number agreement
3. Aspect (perfective and imperfective)
4. Mood (indicative, subjunctive, imperative)
5. Voice (active and passive)

#### Infinitive

The infinitive is formed by adding **-ан** (-an) to the past stem:
- **хондан** (khondan) “to read”
- **рафтан** (raftan) “to go”

#### Present Tense

The present tense is formed by adding personal endings to the present stem:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | -ам (-am) | -ем (-em) |
| 2nd | -ӣ (-ī) | -ед (-ed) |
| 3rd | -ад (-ad) | -анд (-and) |

Example with **рафтан** (raftan) “to go” (present stem: **рав-** rav-):

- **ман меравам** (man meravam) “I go”
- **ту меравӣ** (tu meravī) “you go”
- **ӯ меравад** (u meravad) “he/she goes”
- **мо меравем** (mo meravem) “we go”
- **шумо меравед** (shumo meraved) “you go (plural/formal)”
- **онҳо мераванд** (onho meravand) “they go”

The prefix **ме-** (me-) indicates the imperfective aspect.

#### Past Tense

The past tense is formed by adding personal endings to the past stem:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | -ам (-am) | -ем (-em) |
| 2nd | -ӣ (-ī) | -ед (-ed) |
| 3rd | - | -анд (-and) |

Example with **рафтан** (raftan) “to go” (past stem: **рафт-** raft-):

- **шумо рафтед** (shumo rafted) “you went (plural/formal)”
- **онҳо рафтанд** (onho raftand) “they went”

#### Future Tense

The future tense is formed using the present tense of the verb **хостан** (khostan) “to want” followed by the infinitive:

- **ман хоҳам рафт** (man khoham raft) “I will go”
- **ту хоҳӣ рафт** (tu khohī raft) “you will go”
- **ӯ хоҳад рафт** (u khohad raft) “he/she will go”

#### Subjunctive Mood

The subjunctive mood is formed by adding personal endings to the present stem, without the prefix **ме-** (me-):

- **ман равам** (man ravam) “that I go”
- **ту равӣ** (tu ravī) “that you go”
- **ӯ равад** (u ravad) “that he/she go”

#### Imperative Mood

The imperative is formed from the present stem:

- Singular: present stem (e.g., **рав** rav “go!”)
- Plural: present stem + **-ед** (-ed) (e.g., **равед** raved “go!”)

#### Passive Voice

The passive voice is formed using the past participle (past stem + **-а** -a) and the auxiliary verb **шудан** (shudan) “to become”:

- **хонда шудан** (khonda shudan) “to be read”
- **китоб хонда шуд** (kitob khonda shud) “the book was read”

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Tajik is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV):

**Ман китобро хондам.** (Man kitobro khondam.)
“I read the book.”

However, the word order can be flexible for emphasis or in poetic language.

### Object Marking

Direct objects are often marked with the suffix **-ро** (-ro):

**Ман китобро хондам.** (Man kitobro khondam.)
“I read the book.”

### Ezafe Construction

Tajik uses the ezafe construction to show possession and attribution. The ezafe is represented by the suffix **-и** (-i):

**китоби ман** (kitobi man) “my book”
**духтари зебо** (dukhtari zebo) “beautiful girl”

### Compound Verbs

Tajik has many compound verbs formed by combining a noun or adjective with a light verb:

**кор кардан** (kor kardan) “to work” (lit. “work do”)

### Negation

Verbs are negated using the prefix **на-** (na-):

**Ман намеравам.** (Man nameravam.)
“I'm not going.”

In the past tense, the negative prefix is **на-** (na-):

**Ман нарафтам.** (Man naraftam.)
“I didn't go.”

For the imperative, the negative prefix is **на-** (na-):

**Наравед!** (Naraved!)
“Don’t go!”

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by intonation or by using the particle **оё** (oyo) at the beginning of the sentence:

**Оё шумо тоҷикӣ мехонед?** (Oyo shumo tojikī mekhoned?)
“Do you read Tajik?”

Wh-questions use interrogative pronouns at the beginning of the sentence:

2. Central dialects (spoken in central Tajikistan)
3. Southern dialects (spoken in southern Tajikistan)
4. Pamir dialects (spoken in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region)

The standard literary Tajik is based primarily on the northern dialects.

Some differences between dialects include:

## Colloquial Tajik

Colloquial Tajik differs from the literary standard in several ways:

1. Pronunciation:
   - Dropping of final **-а** (-a) in some words: 
     **хона** (khona) → **хун** (khun) “house”

2. Vocabulary:
   - Use of more Russian loanwords in everyday speech
   - Preference for simpler Persian-origin words over Arabic loanwords

3. Grammar:
   - Simplified verb forms in some tenses
   - More flexible word order

4. Contractions:
   - **намедонам** (namedonam) → **намдонам** (namdonam) “I don’t know”

## Code-switching

Due to the multilingual nature of Tajik society, code-switching between Tajik and Russian or Uzbek is common in everyday speech:

**Ман ба магазин рафта, хлеб харидам.** (Man ba magazin rafta, khleb kharidam.)
“I went to the store and bought bread.” (magazin and khleb are Russian words)

## Honorifics and Politeness

Tajik has a system of honorifics and polite forms:

1. Formal “you”: **шумо** (shumo) instead of **ту** (tu)

2. Titles:
   - **ҷаноб** (janob) “Mr.”
   - **хонум** (khonum) “Mrs./Ms.”
   - **устод** (ustod) “professor/master”

3. Polite verb forms:
   - Using plural forms for singular referents in formal situations

4. Respect vocabulary:
   - **ташриф овардан** (tashrif ovardan) “to come” (respectful)
   instead of **омадан** (omadan) “to come” (neutral)

## Orthography

While modern Tajik primarily uses the Cyrillic script, there have been periods of using other writing systems:

1. Persian-Arabic script (before 1928)
2. Latin script (1928-1940)
3. Cyrillic script (1940-present)

There have been some efforts to reintroduce the Persian-Arabic script, particularly for cultural and historical texts.

Some orthographic rules in the Cyrillic script:

1. The letter **ӣ** (ī) is used to distinguish the long /iː/ from short /i/
2. The letter **ӯ** (ū) represents the long /uː/
3. The letter **ъ** (') represents the glottal stop in Arabic loanwords

## Challenges for Learners

Some common challenges for learners of Tajik include:

1. Mastering the verb system, especially aspect and mood
2. Learning the extensive vocabulary influenced by Persian, Arabic, and Russian
3. Understanding the nuances of the ezafe construction
4. Adapting to the SOV word order (for speakers of SVO languages)
5. Distinguishing between literary and colloquial forms of the language

By understanding these various aspects of the Tajik language, learners can gain a comprehensive view of its structure, usage, and cultural context.
