# Javanese

Javanese (ꦧꦱꦗꦮ, **Basa Jawa**) is an Austronesian language spoken primarily on the Indonesian island of Java. It is the native language of over 98 million people, making it the most widely spoken regional language in Indonesia. Javanese has a rich literary tradition and a complex system of speech levels that reflect social status and relationships.

## Orthography

Javanese can be written in three different scripts: Latin (the most common today), Javanese script (ꦲꦏ꧀ꦱꦫꦗꦮ, **aksara Jawa**), and Arabic-derived Pegon. This text will focus on the Latin script with some examples in Javanese script.

### Latin script

The Latin alphabet for Javanese uses 26 standard letters plus é, è, and ê. Diacritics are used to represent sounds not found in the basic Latin alphabet:

- é [e] - close-mid front unrounded vowel
- è [ɛ] - open-mid front unrounded vowel
- ê [ə] - mid central vowel (schwa)

Examples:
- **séla** [sela] "rock"
- **tèh** [tɛh] "tea"
- **têmbang** [təmbaŋ] "song"

### Javanese script

The traditional Javanese script is an abugida, where each consonant has an inherent /a/ vowel. Other vowels are indicated by diacritics. Some key features:

1. Basic consonants (ꦲꦏꦱꦫ, **aksara**):
   - ꦲ (ha), ꦤ (na), ꦕ (ca), ꦫ (ra), ꦏ (ka), ꦢ (da), ꦠ (ta), ꦱ (sa), ꦮ (wa), ꦭ (la), 
   - ꦥ (pa), ꦝ (dha), ꦗ (ja), ꦪ (ya), ꦚ (nya), ꦩ (ma), ꦒ (ga), ꦧ (ba), ꦛ (tha), ꦔ (nga)

2. Vowel diacritics (ꦱꦤ꧀ꦝꦁꦔꦤ꧀, **sandhangan**):
   - ꦶ (i), ꦸ (u), ꦺ (é), ꦼ (ê), ꦺꦴ (o)
   - ꦷ (î, pepet), ꦹ (û, suku mendut)

3. Special consonants (ꦥꦱꦁꦔꦤ꧀, **pasangan**): used to write consonant clusters

Examples:
- ꦗꦮ (Jawa)
- ꦱꦸꦫꦧꦪ (Surabaya)
- ꦪꦺꦴꦒꦾꦏꦂꦠ (Yogyakarta)

4. Punctuation marks:
   - ꧈ (pada lingsa): comma
   - ꧉ (pada lungsi): full stop
   - ꧇ (pada pangkat): colon

### Pegon script

Pegon is an Arabic-derived script used to write Javanese, primarily in Islamic contexts. It adds several letters to represent sounds not found in Arabic:

- ڮ (g)
- ڟ (ny)
- ڠ (ng)
- ڤ (p)
- ڽ (ny, alternative)
- ۏ (v)
- ݢ (g, alternative)

Example in Pegon:
جاوا (Jawa)

## Phonology

### Consonants

| | Labial | Dental/Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |

| Nasal | m | n | ɲ | ŋ | |
| Fricative | | s | | | h |
| Approximant | w | l r | j | | |

Notes:
1. The glottal stop [ʔ] is not usually written in the Latin script but is present in many words, especially between vowels.
2. Some dialects have additional sounds, such as [f] and [v] in loanwords.

Examples:
- **pari** [pari] "rice plant"
- **bapak** [bapaʔ] "father"
- **tuku** [tuku] "buy"
- **dalan** [dalan] "road"

| Open | | a | |

Notes:
1. The mid central vowel [ə] (schwa) is written as 'e' in the Latin script and is often unstressed.
2. Some dialects may have additional vowel sounds or diphthongs.

Examples:
- **iki** [iki] "this"

### Phonotactics

Javanese syllable structure is generally (C)V(C), where C is a consonant and V is a vowel. Consonant clusters are rare in native words but can occur in loanwords.

Examples:
- **wong** [wɔŋ] "person"
- **telu** [təlu] "three"
- **mripat** [mripat] "eye"
- **klapa** [klapa] "coconut"

- **sekolah** [səˈkolah] "school"
- **kahuripan** [kahuˈripan] "life"

In some cases, especially with the addition of suffixes, stress can move:

- **omahé** [omaˈhe] "his/her house"

The basic word order in Javanese is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):

I eat bread
"I eat bread."

**Bapak tuku pit anyar.**
Father buy bicycle new
"Father buys a new bicycle."

However, word order can be flexible, especially in colloquial speech:

Bread I eat
"I eat the bread." (with focus on "bread")

**Anyar pite Bapak.**
New bicycle-the Father
"Father's bicycle is new."

### Topic-comment structure

Javanese often uses a topic-comment structure, where the topic is introduced first, followed by a comment about it:

**Kucing kuwi, wulune ireng.**
Cat that, fur-its black
"That cat, its fur is black."

**Omah sing gedhe kae, duweke sapa?**
House REL big that, property-of who
"That big house, whose property is it?"

### Particles

### Negation

   I NEG eat
   "I don't eat."

2. **dudu** (negation of nouns)

### Question formation

Questions in Javanese can be formed in several ways:

1. Using question words:
   - **apa** "what"
   - **sapa** "who"
   - **ngendi** "where"
   - **kapan** "when"
   - **piye** "how"
   - **pira** "how many/much"

   Example:
   **Kowe arep neng ngendi?**
   You will to where
   "Where are you going?"

2. Using intonation:
   **Kowe wis mangan?**
   You already eat
   "Have you eaten?"

3. Using the particle **apa**:
   **Apa kowe wis mangan?**
   Q you already eat
   "Have you eaten?"

4. Using **ta** at the end of the sentence:
   **Kowe wis mangan ta?**
   You already eat Q
   "You've eaten, right?"

### Relative clauses

Relative clauses in Javanese are formed using the relative pronoun **sing** ("that/which/who"):

**Wong sing nganggo klambi abang kae adhiku.**
Person REL wear shirt red that younger.sibling-my
"The person who is wearing a red shirt is my younger sibling."

**Buku sing taktuku wingi wis ilang.**
Book REL I-buy yesterday already lost
"The book that I bought yesterday is already lost."

### Comparatives and superlatives

1. Comparative:
   Use **luwih ... tinimbang** ("more ... than"):
   
   **Omahku luwih gedhe tinimbang omahe.**
   House-my more big than house-his
   "My house is bigger than his house."

2. Superlative:
   Use **paling** ("most") or **dhewe** ("most" when placed after the adjective):

   **Dheweke wong paling pinter neng kelase.**
   He/She person most smart in class-his/her
   "He/She is the smartest person in his/her class."

   **Omahe gedhe dhewe neng kampung kene.**
   House-his/her big most in village here
   "His/her house is the biggest in this village."

### Serial verb constructions

Javanese often uses serial verb constructions, where two or more verbs are used together without conjunctions:

**Aku mlaku mulih.**
I walk go.home
"I walk home."

**Ibu lungguh maca koran.**
Mother sit read newspaper
"Mother sits reading the newspaper."

## Speech levels

One of the most distinctive features of Javanese is its system of speech levels, which reflect the social relationship between speakers. There are three main levels:

1. **Ngoko** (informal):
   Used among friends, family, or to subordinates.
   Example: **Kowe arep neng endi?** "Where are you going?"

2. **Madya** (semi-formal):
   A middle level, less formal than Krama but more polite than Ngoko.
   Example: **Sampeyan ajeng teng pundi?** "Where are you going?"

3. **Krama** (formal):
   Used to show respect to elders, superiors, or strangers.
   Example: **Panjenengan badhe tindak pundi?** "Where are you going?"

Each level has its own vocabulary for many common words:

| Ngoko | Madya | Krama | English |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| aku | kula | dalem | I |
| kowe | sampeyan | panjenengan | you |
| mangan | nedha | dhahar | eat |
| turu | tilem | sare | sleep |
| omah | griya | dalem | house |
| lunga | kesah | tindak | go |
| teka | dhateng | rawuh | come |
| weruh | sumerep | pirsa | see |
| kandha | criyos | matur | say |
| gelem | purun | kersa | willing |

Additionally, there's a set of honorific vocabulary called **Krama Inggil** used to refer to the actions or possessions of respected persons:

- **omah** (house, Ngoko) → **griya** (house, Krama Inggil)
- **anak** (child, Ngoko) → **putra** (child, Krama Inggil)
- **mata** (eye, Ngoko) → **paningal** (eye, Krama Inggil)
- **tangan** (hand, Ngoko) → **asta** (hand, Krama Inggil)
- **sare** (sleep, Krama) → **sare** (sleep, Krama Inggil)

The use of speech levels is complex and depends on various factors such as age, social status, familiarity, and context. Mistakes in using the appropriate level can lead to social awkwardness or even offense.

Example of the same sentence in different speech levels:

Ngoko: **Kowe wis mangan?**
Madya: **Sampeyan sampun nedha?**
Krama: **Panjenengan sampun dhahar?**
"Have you eaten?"
