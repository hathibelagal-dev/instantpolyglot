I apologize for the brevity. I'll expand the overview to provide more depth and examples for each section, aiming for at least 4000 words.

# Cebuano

Cebuano, also known as Sugbuanon or Bisaya, is an Austronesian language spoken primarily in the central and southern Philippines. It is the second most widely spoken native language in the Philippines after Tagalog, with approximately 20 million native speakers. Cebuano is the primary language of the Visayas region, particularly in Cebu, Bohol, Negros Oriental, and parts of Mindanao. As a member of the Austronesian language family, Cebuano shares many features with other Philippine languages, but it also has its own unique characteristics that set it apart.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Cebuano has 16 consonant phonemes:

| Manner of Articulation | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|------------------------|--------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Plosive                | p b    | t d      |         | k g   | ʔ       |
| Nasal                  | m      | n        | ɲ       | ŋ     |         |
| Fricative              |        | s        |         |       | h       |
| Approximant            | w      | l        | j       |       |         |
| Trill                  |        | r        |         |       |         |

Notable features of Cebuano consonants include:

1. The glottal stop [ʔ] is phonemic but often not represented in writing. It frequently occurs word-finally and between vowels.
   Example: **bata** [baˈtaʔ] “child”

2. The velar nasal [ŋ] is represented by the digraph “ng” in writing.
   Example: **mangga** [ˈmaŋga] “mango”

3. The palatal nasal [ɲ] is represented by “ny” in writing, though it's relatively rare.
   Example: **nyora** [ˈɲora] “madam” (from Spanish “señora”)

4. The sounds [f], [v], and [z] are not native to Cebuano but may appear in loanwords.
   Example: **fyesta** [fjɛsta] “fiesta” (from Spanish “fiesta”)

### Vowels

Cebuano has three vowel phonemes:

| Front | Central | Back |
|-------|---------|------|
| i     |         | u    |
|       | a       |      |

In practice, [e] and [o] may appear as allophones of /i/ and /u/ respectively, especially in loanwords. The realization of these vowels can vary depending on the speaker and the dialect:

1. /i/ can be realized as [i], [ɪ], or [e]
   Example: **bilin** [biˈlin] ~ [bɪˈlɪn] ~ [beˈlen] “to leave behind”

2. /u/ can be realized as [u], [ʊ], or [o]
   Example: **bukog** [buˈkog] ~ [bʊˈkʊg] ~ [boˈkog] “bone”

3. /a/ is generally consistent as [a], but may be slightly raised [ɐ] in unstressed syllables
   Example: **alahas** [aˈlahas] ~ [ɐˈlahas] “jewelry”

### Phonotactics

Cebuano syllable structure is typically (C)V(C), where C represents a consonant and V represents a vowel. Some key points about Cebuano phonotactics:

1. Most native Cebuano words do not have consonant clusters within a syllable.

2. When consonant clusters do occur, they are usually the result of affixation or loanwords.
   Example: **magdala** [mag.ˈda.la] “to bring” (mag- prefix + dala “bring”)

3. Vowel sequences are common and can occur across syllable boundaries.
   Example: **baul** [ba.ˈʊl] “chest, trunk”

4. The glottal stop often appears between vowels in vowel sequences.
   Example: **baug** [baˈʔug] “bland, tasteless”

### Stress

Stress in Cebuano is typically on the penultimate syllable, but there are exceptions. Stress can be phonemic, meaning it can distinguish between otherwise identical words:

- **túbo** [ˈtu.bo] “sugar cane”
- **tubó** [tu.ˈbo] “to grow”

Other examples of stress-based minimal pairs:

- **báta** [ˈba.ta] “robe” vs. **batá** [ba.ˈta] “child”
- **dápit** [ˈda.pit] “to invite” vs. **dapít** [da.ˈpit] “nearby”

Stress placement can shift when affixes are added to a word:

- **sulat** [ˈsu.lat] “write” → **magsulat** [mag.su.ˈlat] “to write”
- **balay** [ˈba.laj] “house” → **kabalayan** [ka.ba.la.ˈjan] “group of houses”

It's important to note that stress is not typically marked in written Cebuano, so learners must often rely on context or memorization to determine the correct stress pattern.

## Orthography

Cebuano uses the Latin alphabet, consisting of 26 letters. The orthography is largely phonemic, with most letters representing their IPA equivalents. Some notable features:

1. **ng** represents the velar nasal [ŋ]
   Example: **manga** [ˈma.ŋa] “mango”

2. **y** represents the palatal approximant [j]
   Example: **yawa** [ˈja.wa] “devil”

3. The glottal stop [ʔ] is not typically written, but may be represented by a hyphen in some cases
   Example: **ting-init** [tiŋ.ˈʔi.nit] “summer” (hyphen indicates glottal stop)

4. Double consonants are rare but can occur in some words, usually indicating a stressed syllable
   Example: **bukko** [ˈbuk.ko] “hunchback”

5. The letters c, f, j, ñ, q, v, x, and z are not native to Cebuano but may appear in loanwords or proper names
   Example: **Juan** [ˈhwan] (Spanish name)

6. Some dialects or informal writing may use alternative spellings:
   - “e” for /i/: **ke** instead of **ki** “what”
   - “o” for /u/: **ako** instead of **aku** “I, me”

7. Diacritics are not commonly used in everyday writing but may appear in dictionaries or language learning materials to indicate stress:
   Example: **túbo** (sugar cane) vs. **tubó** (to grow)

## Morphology

Cebuano is an agglutinative language with a complex system of affixes that modify the meaning and grammatical function of roots. This morphological complexity is one of the defining features of the language.

### Nouns

Nouns in Cebuano are not inflected for gender or number. Plurality is typically expressed through context or by using numerical or quantifying words.

#### Case Marking

Cebuano uses a system of particles to mark the case of nouns:

1. **ang** - marks the topic (often the subject)
2. **sa** - marks the genitive or locative
3. **ug** (or **og**) - marks the object

Examples:
- **Mikaon ang bata ug mansanas.** “The child ate an apple.”
  (ang bata = topic/subject, ug mansanas = object)
- **Ang libro sa bata** “The child's book”
  (sa bata = genitive, indicating possession)
- **Niadto siya sa merkado.** “He/She went to the market.”
  (sa merkado = locative)

#### Plural Marking

While nouns themselves don’t change form for plurality, there are several ways to indicate plural nouns:

1. Numerical quantifiers:
   - **duha ka balay** “two houses”
   - **tulo ka bata** “three children”

2. Non-numerical quantifiers:
   - **daghang tawo** “many people”
   - **pipila ka bulan** “a few months”

3. Plural personal pronouns:
   - **sila Pedro** “Pedro and his companions”

4. Reduplication (in some cases):
   - **balay-balay** “houses” (can also mean “small house” or “toy house”)

#### Noun Affixes

Cebuano uses various affixes to derive nouns from other parts of speech or to modify noun meanings:

1. -an (place where action occurs):
   - **kaon** “eat” → **kan-anan** “dining room”
   - **tulog** “sleep” → **tuluganan** “bedroom”

2. mag- (one who does the action):
   - **tuon** “study” → **magtutuon** “student”
   - **luto** “cook” → **magluluto** “cook (person)”

3. ka- (state of being):
   - **lipay** “happy” → **kalipay** “happiness”
   - **busog** “full (after eating)” → **kabusog** “fullness”

4. -on (object of action):
   - **kaon** “eat” → **kan-onon** “food”
   - **inom** “drink” → **imnunon** “beverage”

5. pang- (tool or instrument):
   - **sulat** “write” → **panulat** “writing instrument”
   - **luto** “cook” → **pangluto** “cooking utensil”

### Pronouns

Cebuano pronouns are marked for person, number, and case. The pronoun system is more complex than in many European languages, with distinctions that don’t exist in languages like English.

#### Personal Pronouns

| Person | Topic | Genitive | Oblique |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| 1S     | ako   | ako, ku  | kanako  |
| 2S     | ikaw  | imo, mu  | kanimo  |
| 3S     | siya  | iya      | kaniya  |
| 1P incl| kita  | ato      | kanato  |
| 1P excl| kami  | amo      | kanamo  |
| 2P     | kamo  | inyo     | kaninyo |
| 3P     | sila  | ila      | kanila  |

Examples:
- **Mikaon ako ug pan.** “I ate bread.”
- **Iya kining balay.** “This is his/her house.”
- **Gihatag nako kanimo ang libro.** “I gave you the book.”

Note the distinction between inclusive “we” (kita, including the listener) and exclusive “we” (kami, excluding the listener).

#### Demonstrative Pronouns

Cebuano has a three-way distinction in demonstratives:

1. kini/ni - near the speaker
2. kana/na - near the listener
3. kadto/to - far from both speaker and listener

Examples:
- **Kini ang akong balay.** “This is my house.” (near speaker)
- **Kana ba ang imong kotse?** “Is that your car?” (near listener)
- **Kadto ang ilang eskwelahan.** “That is their school.” (far from both)

#### Interrogative Pronouns

Common interrogative pronouns include:

- **kinsa** “who”
- **unsa** “what”
- **asa** “where”
- **kanus-a** “when”
- **ngano** “why”
- **pila** “how many/much”

Examples:
- **Kinsa ang imong ngalan?** “What is your name?” (literally “Who is your name?”)
- **Asa ka moadto?** “Where are you going?”
- **Pila ang imong edad?** “How old are you?” (literally “How many is your age?”)

### Verbs

Cebuano verbs are highly complex, with a rich system of affixes indicating aspect, mood, and focus. The basic structure of a Cebuano verb is:

(Aspect/Mood prefix) + ROOT + (Focus suffix)

#### Aspect and Mood

Cebuano verbs are marked for four aspects/moods:

1. Neutral/Infinitive: unmarked
2. Completed: **mi-**, **ni-**, or **-in-**
3. Incompleted: **ma-** or **mo-**
4. Imperative: **pag-**

Examples:
- **kaon** “to eat” (neutral)
- **mikaon** “ate” (completed)
- **mokaon** “will eat” (incompleted)
- **pagkaon** “eat!” (imperative)

Additional examples:
- **tulog** “to sleep”
  - **natulog** “slept”
  - **matulog** “will sleep”
  - **pagtulog** “sleep!”

- **sulat** “to write”
  - **misulat** “wrote”
  - **mosulat** “will write”
  - **pagsulat** “write!”

#### Focus System

One of the most distinctive features of Cebuano (and other Philippine languages) is the focus system. Different verbal affixes indicate which argument of the sentence is in focus:

1. Actor Focus (AF): -um-, mo-, mi-
2. Object Focus (OF): -on
3. Locative Focus (LF): -an
4. Benefactive Focus (BF): i-

Examples:
- AF: **Mokaon ang bata ug mansanas.** “The child will eat an apple.”
- OF: **Kaonon sa bata ang mansanas.** “The apple will be eaten by the child.”
- LF: **Kaanan sa bata ang plato.** “The plate will be eaten from by the child.”
- BF: **Ikaon sa bata ang kutsara.** “The spoon will be used by the child to eat.”

More examples to illustrate the focus system:

1. Actor Focus:
   - **Molangoy ang bata sa dagat.** “The child will swim in the sea.”
   - **Misulat ang estudyante ug paril.** “The student wrote an essay.”

2. Object Focus:
   - **Lutoon nako ang isda.** “I will cook the fish.”
   - **Basahon sa maestra ang libro.** “The teacher will read the book.”

3. Locative Focus:
   - **Lutoan nako ang kusina.** “I will cook in the kitchen.”
   - **Tulgan niya ang bag-ong katre.** “He will sleep on the new bed.”

4. Benefactive Focus:
   - **Iluto nako ang isda para sa mga bisita.** “I will cook the fish for the visitors.”
   - **Ipalit nako ikaw ug sapatos.** “I will buy shoes for you.”

#### Verbal Affixes

Cebuano has a wide array of verbal affixes that can modify the meaning of the root word. Some common affixes include:

1. mag- (actor focus, habitual or professional action):
   - **luto** “cook” → **magluto** “to cook (regularly or professionally)”

2. maka- (actor focus, ability):
   - **sulat** “write” → **makasulat** “can write, able to write”

3. ma- (stative):
   - **lipay** “happy” → **malipay** “to become happy”

4. mahi- (involuntary action):
   - **tumba** “fall” → **mahitumba** “to fall accidentally”

5. magpa- (causative):
   - **kaon** “eat” → **magpakaon** “to feed, to cause to eat”

6. makig- (social action):
   - **storya** “talk” → **makigstorya** “to converse with”

These affixes can be combined in various ways, leading to a highly expressive verbal system.

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Cebuano typically come after the noun they modify. Many adjectives are formed by adding the prefix **ma-** to a root:

- **taas** “tall” → **mataas** “tall”
- **pula** “red” → **mapula** “red”
- **init** “hot” → **mainit** “hot”
- **lami** “delicious” → **malami** “delicious”

However, not all adjectives use the ma- prefix:

- **dako** “big”
- **gamay** “small”
- **bag-o** “new”
- **daan** “old”

#### Comparison of Adjectives

Comparatives are formed with **mas** (“more”) or **minus** (“less”):
- **Mas taas si Juan kaysa kang Pedro.** “Juan is taller than Pedro.”
- **Minus init ang panahon karon kaysa gahapon.** “The weather is less hot today than yesterday.”

Superlatives use **labing**:
- **Labing taas si Juan sa tanan.** “Juan is the tallest of all.”
- **Kini ang labing mahal nga balay sa syudad.** “This is the most expensive house in the city.”

#### Intensifiers

Cebuano uses several intensifiers to modify adjectives:

- **kaayo**: very
  Example: **Lami kaayo ang pagkaon.** “The food is very delicious.”

- **gayud**: really, truly
  Example: **Dako gayud ang ilang balay.** “Their house is really big.”

- **ra**: just, only
  Example: **Gamay ra ang akong kwarta.** “I only have a little money.”

#### Adjective Affixes

Several affixes can be used to create or modify adjectives:

1. ka-: used to form abstract nouns from adjectives
   - **taas** “tall” → **kataas** “height”
   - **pula** “red” → **kapula** “redness”

2. -g-: infixed to intensify certain adjectives
   - **pula** “red” → **pugla** “very red”
   - **puti** “white” → **pugti** “very white”

3. paka-: used to mean “pretending to be” or “considering as”
   - **dato** “rich” → **pakadato** “pretending to be rich”
   - **maayo** “good” → **pakamaayo** “considering as good”

### Adverbs

Many adverbs in Cebuano are formed by adding the prefix **pag-** to an adjective or verb root:

- **hinay** “slow” → **paghinay** “slowly”
- **dali** “quick” → **pagdali** “quickly”
- **maayo** “good” → **pagmaayo** “well”

Other common adverbs include:

- **kanunay** “always”
- **usahay** “sometimes”
- **hapit** “almost”
- **kalit** “suddenly”

Adverbs typically precede the word they modify:

- **Kanunay siya nagbasa ug libro.** “He always reads books.”
- **Hinay kaayo siya molakaw.** “He walks very slowly.”

## Syntax

Cebuano is a predicate-initial language, meaning the basic word order is Verb-Subject-Object (VSO). However, due to the focus system and the use of topic markers, word order can be quite flexible.

### Basic Sentence Structure

A typical Cebuano sentence follows this pattern:

VERB + TOPIC + non-topic arguments

Examples:
- **Mikaon ang bata ug mansanas.** “The child ate an apple.”
  (Verb: mikaon, Topic: ang bata, Object: ug mansanas)

- **Gihatag sa babaye ang libro sa bata.** “The woman gave the book to the child.”
  (Verb: gihatag, Actor: sa babaye, Topic/Object: ang libro, Recipient: sa bata)

### Topic and Focus

The topic of a Cebuano sentence is marked by **ang** and is often the subject of the sentence, but not always. The focus system allows different elements of the sentence to be highlighted as the topic:

1. Actor Focus:
   **Miluto ang babaye ug pan.** “The woman cooked bread.”
   (The actor “babaye” is the topic)

2. Object Focus:
   **Giluto sa babaye ang pan.** “The bread was cooked by the woman.”
   (The object “pan” is the topic)

3. Locative Focus:
   **Gilutoan sa babaye ang pugon.** “The oven was cooked in by the woman.”
   (The location “pugon” is the topic)

4. Benefactive Focus:
   **Gilutoan sa babaye ug pan ang mga bata.** “The children were cooked bread for by the woman.”
   (The beneficiary “mga bata” is the topic)

### Questions

Yes/no questions are formed by adding the particle **ba** at the end of a statement:
- **Mikaon ka ba?** “Did you eat?”
- **Gusto ba nimo ang kape?** “Do you like coffee?”

Information questions use interrogative words such as:
- **kinsa** “who”
- **unsa** “what”
- **asa** “where”
- **kanus-a** “when”
- **ngano** “why”
- **pila** “how many/much”

Examples:
- **Unsa ang imong ngalan?** “What is your name?”
- **Asa ka nagpuyo?** “Where do you live?”
- **Kanus-a ka moanhi?** “When will you come here?”

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed using **dili** for future or habitual actions, and **wala** for past actions:

- **Dili ko mokaon ug mansanas.** “I will not eat an apple.”
- **Wala ko mikaon ug mansanas.** “I did not eat an apple.”
- **Dili siya maayo moluto.** “He is not good at cooking.”
- **Wala siya mahuman sa iyang trabaho.** “He didn't finish his work.”

### Existential Sentences

Existential sentences use **aduna** or its shortened form **naa** for positive statements, and **wala** for negative:

- **Adunay libro sa lamesa.** “There is a book on the table.”
- **Naa bay tubig sa refrigerator?** “Is there water in the refrigerator?”
- **Wala'y libro sa lamesa.** “There is no book on the table.”

### Imperative Sentences

Imperatives can be formed in several ways:

1. Using the infinitive form of the verb:
   **Kaon!** “Eat!”

2. Using the pag- prefix:
   **Pagkaon!** “Eat!”

3. Using palihug for polite requests:
   **Palihug, ihatag kanako ang asin.** “Please, give me the salt.”

### Conditional Sentences

Conditional sentences often use the particle **kung** (“if”):

- **Kung moulan, dili ko mogawas.** “If it rains, I won’t go out.”
- **Kung aduna koy kwarta, mopalit ko ug bag-ong sapatos.** “If I had money, I would buy new shoes.”

## Vocabulary

Cebuano vocabulary is primarily Austronesian in origin, but has been influenced by various languages due to historical contact:

### Spanish Loanwords

Spanish has had a significant influence on Cebuano vocabulary, particularly in areas of religion, governance, and everyday items:

- **krus** “cross” (from Spanish “cruz”)
- **simbahan** “church” (from Spanish “simba”)
- **kwarta** “money” (from Spanish “cuarta”)
- **sapatos** “shoes” (from Spanish “zapatos”)
- **lamesa** “table” (from Spanish “la mesa”)
- **kutsilyo** “knife” (from Spanish “cuchillo”)
- **tinidor** “fork” (from Spanish “tenedor”)
- **merkado** “market” (from Spanish “mercado”)

### English Loanwords

English loanwords are common, especially in modern and technical contexts:

- **kompyuter** “computer”
- **selpon** “cellphone”
- **miting** “meeting”
- **nars** “nurse”
- **traysikel** “tricycle” (a common form of transportation)
- **mall** “mall”
- **text** “text message”
- **internet** “internet”

### Native Cebuano Words

Many basic vocabulary items remain native Cebuano:

- **balay** “house”
- **tubig** “water”
- **langit** “sky”
- **bukid** “mountain”
- **dagat** “sea”
- **adlaw** “sun, day”
- **bulan** “moon, month”
- **bituon** “star”
- **hangin** “wind”
- **ulan** “rain”

### Affixes and Word Formation

Cebuano makes extensive use of affixes to form new words:

- **tindahan** “store” (from **tinda** “sell” + -han “place”)
- **magdudula** “player” (from **dula** “play” + mag- “one who” + reduplication for habitual action)
- **palaliton** “something to be bought” (from **palit** “buy” + -on “object focus”)
- **tagdumaladula** “director” (from **dumala** “manage” + tag- “one who” + reduplication)
- **panimalay** “household” (from **balay** “house” + paN- “related to”)

### Reduplication

Reduplication is a common feature in Cebuano word formation:

1. Full reduplication:
   - **adlaw-adlaw** “daily” (from **adlaw** “day”)
   - **tawo-tawo** “doll, puppet” (from **tawo** “person”)

2. Partial reduplication:
   - **balak-balay** “small house” (from **balay** “house”)
   - **sug-angsugang** “play cooking” (from **sugang** “cook”)

## Idiomatic Expressions

Cebuano has many idiomatic expressions that reflect local culture and values:

- **Wa'y unsa-unsa** (lit. “There's nothing-nothing”) - “You're welcome” or “No problem”
- **Amping** (lit. “Take care”) - A common farewell
- **Ayaw kabalaka** (lit. “Don’t worry”) - “Don’t worry” or “It's okay”
- **Maayo unta** (lit. “May it be good”) - “Hopefully” or “I hope so”
- **Bahala na** (lit. “Come what may”) - Expressing resignation or “Whatever happens, happens”
- **Pwede na** (lit. “It can already”) - “It's good enough” or “That'll do”
- **Kana lang** (lit. “Just that”) - “That's all” or “That's enough”

## Colloquial Cebuano

Colloquial Cebuano often differs from the standard or written form:

- Shortened pronouns: **ko** instead of **ako**, **ka** instead of **ikaw**
- Contracted forms: **di** for **dili**, **'y** for **may**
- Informal particles: **uy** (attention-getter), **baya** (emphasis)
- Slang terms: **piso** (peso), **chicks** (girls), **pare** (friend, buddy)

Example of colloquial speech:
- Standard: **Dili ako mokaon ug mansanas.**
- Colloquial: **Di ko mokaon ug mansanas, uy.**
  Both mean “I won’t eat an apple,” but the colloquial form is more informal and conversational.

## Dialects

While this overview focuses on standard Cebuano, there are several dialects with variations in vocabulary, pronunciation, and sometimes grammar:

1. Boholano: Spoken in Bohol, characterized by the use of /j/ where standard Cebuano uses /ʔ/
   Example: 
   - Standard Cebuano: **wala** [waˈla] “none”
   - Boholano: **waja** [waˈja] “none”

2. Leyte-Samar: Includes some vocabulary differences and intonation patterns
   Example:
   - Standard Cebuano: **dili** “no”
   - Leyte-Samar: **dire** “no”

3. Davao Cebuano: Influenced by local languages in Mindanao
   Example:
   - Standard Cebuano: **unsa** “what”
   - Davao Cebuano: **ono** “what”

Example of dialect difference:
- Standard Cebuano: **Asa ka paingon?** “Where are you going?”
- Boholano: **Hain ka paingon?** (same meaning)

These dialects are generally mutually intelligible, but can pose some challenges for speakers from different regions.

## Cultural Aspects

Language and culture are deeply intertwined, and Cebuano reflects various aspects of Filipino, particularly Visayan, culture:

1. Respect for elders: Use of **po** or **ho** (borrowed from Tagalog) to show respect
   Example: **Salamat po** “Thank you (respectfully)”

2. Indirect communication: Use of euphemisms and roundabout ways of speaking to avoid confrontation
   Example: Instead of directly saying no, one might say **Tan-awon ta** “We'll see”

3. Importance of family: Many terms for extended family members
   Example: **ig-agaw** “cousin”, **bayaw** “brother/sister-in-law”

4. Connection to nature: Many idioms and expressions related to natural phenomena
   Example: **mubo ra ang adlaw** (lit. “the sun is low”) meaning time is short

5. Humor: Cebuano speakers are known for their sense of humor, often using wordplay and double meanings
   Example: **Unsaon man nako pagkaon ana nga wa koy ngipon?** “How can I eat that when I have no teeth?” (used humorously when someone can’t afford something)

This comprehensive overview covers the major aspects of Cebuano grammar, phonology, vocabulary, and usage, providing a detailed introduction to the language for laymen and learners. The complex verb system, focus construction, and rich affixation are particularly important features that distinguish Cebuano from many other languages and contribute to its expressive power.
