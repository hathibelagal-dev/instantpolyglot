# Nahuatl

Nahuatl is an Uto-Aztecan language family native to central Mexico. It was the language of the Aztec Empire and remains spoken by over 1.5 million people today. Nahuatl has many dialects, with Classical Nahuatl being the most studied historical variant.

## Phonology

### Consonants

Nahuatl has a relatively simple consonant inventory:

| Manner | Labial | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|-------|---------|
| Plosive | p | t | | k | ʔ |
| Affricate | | ts, tɬ | tʃ | | |
| Fricative | | s | ʃ | | h |
| Nasal | m | n | | | |
| Lateral | | l | | | |
| Approximant | w | | j | | |

Notes:
- The glottal stop [ʔ] is not typically represented in writing but occurs predictably before word-initial vowels.
- The lateral affricate [tɬ] is represented by the digraph "tl" in most orthographies.

### Vowels

Nahuatl has four vowel qualities, each with a length distinction:

| | Front | Central | Back |
|---|-------|---------|------|
| High | i, iː | | |
| Mid | e, eː | | o, oː |
| Low | | a, aː | |

Long vowels are phonemic and can change the meaning of words:
- **pāni** [paːni] "on top"
- **pani** [pani] "to cross a bridge"

### Phonotactics

Syllable structure in Nahuatl is typically (C)V(ː)(C). Consonant clusters are rare and usually occur across syllable boundaries.

Examples:
- **tlah-tli** [ˈtɬaʔ.tɬi] "earth"
- **xō-chi-tl** [ˈʃoː.tʃitɬ] "flower"
- **mic-tli** [ˈmik.tɬi] "death"

Word-final consonants are limited, with [tɬ], [n], and occasionally [m] being the most common.

### Stress

Stress in Nahuatl is typically on the penultimate syllable:

- **tla-cah-tli** [tɬaˈkaʔ.tɬi] "person"
- **chi-chi-ton-tli** [tʃi.tʃiˈton.tɬi] "puppy"
- **tō-tō-tl** [ˈtoː.toːtɬ] "bird"

Long vowels attract stress:
- **ā-tl** [ˈaːtɬ] "water"
- **tlā-catecolōtl** [tɬaː.ka.teˈko.loːtɬ] "demon" (literally "owl-person")

In compounds, each element may retain its stress, creating words with multiple stresses:
- **cōātl-** + **nāhualli** → **cōā-nāhualli** [ˈkoː.aː.naːˈwal.li] "snake-wizard"

### Phonological Processes

1. Vowel Syncope: In some dialects, unstressed short vowels may be deleted between consonants:
   - **tlācatl** [ˈtɬaː.katɬ] → [tɬaːktɬ] "person"

2. Consonant Assimilation: The nasal [n] assimilates to the place of articulation of a following consonant:
   - **centli** [ˈsen.tɬi] → [ˈsen̪.t̪ɬi] "corn cob"

3. Glottal Stop Insertion: A glottal stop is inserted before word-initial vowels:
   - **acatl** [ˈʔa.katɬ] "reed"

4. Final Devoicing: Word-final [w] is often devoiced:
   - **chōcauh** [ˈtʃoː.kaw̥] "he/she cried"

## Orthography

Classical Nahuatl was originally written using Aztec pictographs, but after Spanish colonization, it adopted the Latin alphabet. Modern Nahuatl orthography varies, but a common system includes:

| Letter | IPA | Examples |
|--------|-----|----------|
| a, ā | [a], [aː] | **atl** [atɬ] "water", **āmatl** [ˈaːmatɬ] "paper" |
| c | [k] before a, o, u; [s] before e, i | **calli** [ˈkalli] "house", **ce** [se] "one" |
| ch | [tʃ] | **chichi** [ˈtʃitʃi] "dog" |
| cu | [kw] | **cuahuitl** [ˈkwawitɬ] "tree" |
| e, ē | [e], [eː] | **metl** [metɬ] "maguey", **cē** [seː] "one" |
| h | [h] | **huēhueh** [ˈweːweh] "old man" |
| hu | [w] | **huītztli** [ˈwiːtstɬi] "thorn" |
| i, ī | [i], [iː] | **ichcatl** [ˈitʃkatɬ] "cotton", **pīpiltin** [ˈpiːpiltin] "nobles" |
| l | [l] | **tlalli** [ˈtɬalli] "land" |
| m | [m] | **mētztli** [ˈmeːtstɬi] "moon" |
| n | [n] | **nochin** [ˈnotʃin] "all" |
| o, ō | [o], [oː] | **ocotl** [ˈokotɬ] "pine", **tōtōtl** [ˈtoːtoːtɬ] "bird" |
| p | [p] | **petlatl** [ˈpetɬatɬ] "mat" |
| qu | [k] before e, i | **quetzalli** [keˈtsalli] "quetzal feather" |
| t | [t] | **tetl** [tetɬ] "stone" |
| tl | [tɬ] | **tlācatl** [ˈtɬaːkatɬ] "person" |
| tz | [ts] | **tzontli** [ˈtsontɬi] "hair" |
| x | [ʃ] | **xōchitl** [ˈʃoːtʃitɬ] "flower" |
| y | [j] | **yōllōtl** [ˈjoːlloːtɬ] "heart" |
| z | [s] | **zōlli** [ˈsoːlli] "old" |

Long vowels are often indicated by a macron (ā, ē, ī, ō) or by doubling (aa, ee, ii, oo).

Some additional orthographic conventions:

1. The saltillo (glottal stop) is sometimes represented by an apostrophe or 'h':
   - **mo'sihuāuh** or **mohsihuāuh** [moʔsiˈwaːw̥] "your wife"

2. Some modern orthographies use 'k' instead of 'c' for the [k] sound:
   - **kalli** instead of **calli** for "house"

3. The digraph 'hu' is sometimes written as 'w':
   - **wahcalli** instead of **huahcalli** for "granary"

4. Some systems use 'j' instead of 'h' for the [h] sound:
   - **juēyi** instead of **huēyi** for "big"

## Morphology

Nahuatl is a highly agglutinative language with polysynthetic features. Words can be extremely long, incorporating multiple morphemes to express complex ideas.

### Nouns

Nouns in Nahuatl inflect for number, possession, and can incorporate other elements.

#### Number

The singular is unmarked. The plural is typically formed by adding the suffix **-meh** or **-tin**:

- **calli** "house" → **calmeh** "houses"
- **cihuātl** "woman" → **cihuah** "women"
- **piltōntli** "child" → **piltōntin** "children"

Some nouns have irregular plurals:
- **tlācatl** "person" → **tlācah** "people"
- **mīlli** "field" → **mīlmeh** "fields"
- **tēuctli** "lord" → **tētēuctin** "lords"

#### Possession

Possessed nouns take prefixes indicating the possessor:

| Person | Prefix | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| 1sg | no- | **nocal** "my house" |
| 2sg | mo- | **mocal** "your house" |
| 3sg | i- | **ical** "his/her house" |
| 1pl | to- | **tocal** "our house" |
| 2pl | amo- | **amocal** "your (pl) house" |
| 3pl | in- | **incal** "their house" |

Many nouns also change their ending when possessed:
- **atl** "water" → **noauh** "my water"
- **tlaxcalli** "tortilla" → **notlaxcal** "my tortilla"
- **ichcatl** "cotton" → **noichcauh** "my cotton"

This possession pattern can lead to complex forms:
- **nocaltzin** "my respected house" (cal + tzin [reverential])
- **amotlaxcaltzitzihuan** "your (pl) respected tortillas" (tlaxcal + tzin [reverential] + huan [plural])

#### Absolutive suffix

Many nouns end in an "absolutive" suffix that drops in certain contexts:
- **-tl** after vowels: **cītli** "grandmother" → **nocī** "my grandmother"
- **-tli** after consonants: **tlaxcalli** "tortilla" → **tlaxcal-** (in compounds)
- **-li** after l: **calli** "house" → **cal-** (in compounds)

Examples of absolutive suffix dropping:
- **ātl** "water" + **comitl** "pot" → **ācomitl** "water pot"
- **cuahuitl** "tree" + **calli** "house" → **cuahcalli** "wooden house"

#### Locative suffixes

Nahuatl uses various locative suffixes to indicate place:

- **-c** "in, at": **caltitlan** "next to the house"
- **-co** "in, at" (for place names): **Mexico** "in Mexico"
- **-pan** "on, upon": **tepetlpan** "on the hill"
- **-tlan** "near, among": **xōchitlan** "among flowers"
- **-tzalan** "between": **cuauhtzalan** "between trees"

#### Noun incorporation

Nahuatl can incorporate nouns into verbs to create new meanings:
- **ni-nacatl-cua** "I meat-eat" (I eat meat)
- **ni-xōchi-temoa** "I flower-seek" (I look for flowers)
- **ni-cua-chīhua** "I head-make" (I lead, I'm in charge)

### Verbs

Nahuatl verbs are highly complex, with prefixes and suffixes indicating subject, object, tense, aspect, mood, and more.

#### Subject prefixes

| Person | Prefix | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| 1sg | ni- | **nicochi** "I sleep" |
| 2sg | ti- | **ticochi** "you sleep" |
| 3sg | ∅- | **cochi** "he/she sleeps" |
| 1pl | ti- | **ticochih** "we sleep" |
| 2pl | an- | **ancochih** "you (pl) sleep" |
| 3pl | ∅- | **cochih** "they sleep" |

#### Object prefixes

| Person | Prefix | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| 1sg | nēch- | **nēchitta** "he/she sees me" |
| 2sg | mitz- | **mitzitta** "he/she sees you" |
| 3sg | qui- / c- | **quiitta** "he/she sees him/her/it" |

#### Tense and aspect

Nahuatl has several tenses and aspects, indicated by various suffixes:

- Present: no suffix
- Imperfect: -ya
- Preterite: various, often -que for plural subjects
- Future: -z

Examples with **cuīca** "to sing":
- **nicuīca** "I sing"
- **nicuīcaya** "I was singing"
- **onicuīcac** "I sang"
- **nicuīcaz** "I will sing"

The perfect aspect is formed with the prefix o-:
- **oniccuīcac** "I have sung"

#### Imperative

The imperative is formed by removing the subject prefix and adding -h:
- **xicuīca** "Sing!"
- **xicochih** "Sleep!" (plural)

#### Applicative

The applicative voice, indicating that the action is done for someone, is formed with the suffix -lia:
- **nicchīhua** "I make it"
- **nicchīhuilia** "I make it for him/her"

#### Causative

The causative, indicating making someone do something, uses the suffix -tia:
- **nicochi** "I sleep"
- **nicochitiā** "I make him/her sleep"

#### Honorific

Nahuatl has an honorific form for verbs, using the prefix tzin-:
- **ximopanolti** "Please enter" (honorific)

#### Reflexive and Reciprocal

Reflexive actions use the prefix mo-:
- **nimoitta** "I see myself"

Reciprocal actions use the prefix ne-:
- **titoneitta** "We see each other"

#### Directional prefixes

Nahuatl uses directional prefixes to indicate motion:
- **hual-** "towards here": **nihuallauh** "I come here"
- **on-** "away": **noncalaqui** "I go in there"

#### Compound verbs

Nahuatl can form compound verbs by combining two verb stems:
- **nicochi** "I sleep" + **nicah** "I am" → **nicochtoc** "I am sleeping"
- **nitlacua** "I eat" + **nicah** "I am" → **nitlacuaticah** "I am in the process of eating"

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Nahuatl typically come after the noun they modify:
- **calli cualli** "good house"
- **tlācatl huēyi** "big person"

Many adjectives are derived from nouns or verbs:
- **temachtilli** "teacher" → **temachtiani** "teaching"
- **cualli** "good" → **cualtic** "of good quality"
- **miqui** "to die" → **micqui** "dead"

Adjectives can also be formed by reduplication:
- **celic** "tender" → **celcelic** "very tender"
- **tomahuac** "fat" → **totonmahuac** "very fat"

Comparison of adjectives is often expressed through separate constructions:
- **Ocachi cualli** "better" (literally "more good")
- **Oc tlapanahuia ic cualli** "best" (literally "it surpasses in goodness")

### Adverbs

Many adverbs in Nahuatl are derived from adjectives by adding the suffix -ca:

Some common adverbs:
- **axcan** "now"
- **niman** "immediately"

- **zan** "only, just"

### Pronouns

Personal pronouns are often omitted as the verb prefixes indicate the subject:

| Person | Pronoun | Example |

- 1000: **ōntzontli ipan cēmpōhualli** (2 × 400 + 1 × 20)

## Syntax

### Word Order

The basic word order in Nahuatl is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), but it can be flexible due to the language's extensive morphology:

- **Nopiltzin āmoxtli quicua.** "My child book-eats." (My child reads a book.)
- **Nicmati in melahuac.** "I-it-know the truth." (I know the truth.)

However, other word orders are possible for emphasis or in certain constructions:
- **Quicua in āmoxtli nopiltzin.** (OVS) "Reads the book my child." (emphasis on the action)
- **In cualli tlācatl quintlazohtla in pipiltzitzintin.** (SVO) "The good person loves the children."

### Questions

Questions are often formed by intonation alone or by using question words:

- **Tleīn ticchīhua?** "What are you doing?"
- **Quēn timomati?** "How are you feeling?"
- **Canin tiyauh?** "Where are you going?"
- **Cuix ticcua in tlaxcalli?** "Do you eat tortillas?" (cuix is an optional question particle)

### Negation

Negation is typically expressed with the particle **ahmo**:

- **Ahmo nicmati.** "I don't know."
- **Ahmo quema niccuas.** "I will never eat it."

Double negation is used for emphasis:
- **Ahmo ahtlahtlacolli** "It is not without sin" (It is sinful)

### Locatives

Nahuatl uses a rich system of locative suffixes:

- **-c** "in, at": **caltitlan** "next to the house"
- **-co** "in, at" (for place names): **Mexico** "in Mexico"
- **-pan** "on, upon": **tepetlpan** "on the hill"
- **-tlan** "among, near": **cuauhtlan** "in the forest"
- **-tzalan** "between": **tepetzalan** "between mountains"

### Respectful Speech

Nahuatl has a complex system of honorific and reverential forms, used to show respect or social distance:

- Adding **-tzin** to nouns: **tlācatl** "person" → **tlācatzintli** "respected person"
- Using special verb forms: **timopanoltia** "you enter" (respectful)
- Reverential pronouns: **moteucyotzin** "your lordship"

### Figurative Language

Nahuatl is known for its extensive use of metaphors and paired concepts called difrasismo:

- **in xōchitl in cuīcatl** "the flower, the song" (meaning poetry, art)
- **in atl in tepetl** "the water, the mountain" (meaning town, city)
- **mitl chimalli** "arrow shield" (meaning war)
- **iztac tetl** "white stone" (meaning punishment)

### Syntax in Poetry

Nahuatl poetry often uses parallelism and repetition for rhetorical effect:

**Cuix oc nelli nemohua in tlalticpac?**
"Is it true that one lives on earth?"

**An nochipa tlalticpac:**
"Not forever on earth:"

**zan achica ye nican.**
"only a little while here."

This example shows the repetition of **tlalticpac** "on earth" and the use of rhetorical questions.

- **cahuāyoh** from Spanish "caballo" (horse)
- **caxitl** from Spanish "caja" (box)
- **tōmin** from Spanish "tomín" (a type of coin, now meaning money)

## Dialects

Modern Nahuatl has many dialects, some of which are not mutually intelligible. Major dialect groups include:

1. Central dialects (including Classical Nahuatl)
2. Northern Puebla dialects
3. Sierra de Zacapoaxtla dialects
4. Isthmus dialects
5. Western dialects

Differences between dialects can include:

- Phonological changes: **tl** → **t** or **l** in some dialects
   Example: **tlalli** (Central) vs **talli** (some Northern dialects) "earth"

- Vocabulary differences
   Example: **cualli** (Central) vs **cualtsin** (some Western dialects) "good"

- Grammatical variations
   Example: Different plural suffixes: **-meh** vs **-tin**

Example (saying "I love you"):
- Classical Nahuatl: **Nimitztlazohtla**
- Huasteca Nahuatl: **Nimitztasojtla**
- Western Nahuatl: **Nimitsnotasojta**

## Sample Texts

Here are some sample texts in Classical Nahuatl with translations:

1. A famous Nahuatl poem:

**Xōchitl in cuīcatl**
"Flower and song" (Poetry)

**In chalchihuitl in quetzalli**
"The jade, the quetzal feather" (Precious things)

**Mach tiquilnamiqui**
"Do you not remember them?"

**In tepilhuan, in ixpilhuan in Nezahualcoyotzin**
"The children, the descendants of Nezahualcoyotl"

This poem uses metaphorical language and rhetorical questions, common features in Nahuatl poetry.

2. A proverb:

**In aquin amo quimati in ohtli, ma quintlātlani in yehuan ye ōnenenqueh.**
"He who doesn't know the road should ask those who have already walked it."

This proverb demonstrates the use of the relative clause (**in aquin amo quimati**) and the perfect aspect (**ye ōnenenqueh**).

3. A conversation:

A: **Quēn timomati?**
   "How are you feeling?"

B: **Cualli. Auh in tehhuātl?**
   "Good. And you?"

A: **Noyuhqui cualli. Tleīn ticchīhua in āxcān?**
   "Also good. What are you doing now?"

B: **Nitlapohua. Huel nicamati in āmoxtli inīn.**
   "I'm reading. I really like this book."

This conversation showcases everyday Nahuatl expressions and the use of question words.

These samples illustrate various aspects of Nahuatl grammar, vocabulary, and cultural expression, from poetic language to everyday conversation.
