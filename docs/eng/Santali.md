# Santali

Santali (ᱥᱟᱱᱛᱟᱲᱤ, **sãnṭaṛi**) is an Austroasiatic language spoken primarily in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is the most widely spoken language of the Munda subfamily of Austroasiatic languages, with approximately 7.6 million speakers. Santali is the primary language of the Santal people, one of the largest tribal communities in India.

## Writing System

Santali has its own script called Ol Chiki (ᱚᱞ ᱪᱤᱠᱤ), developed in 1925 by Pandit Raghunath Murmu. However, the language is also written in various other scripts depending on the region, including Bengali, Devanagari, and Oriya. This text will use Ol Chiki for Santali examples, along with romanization.

### Ol Chiki Script

The Ol Chiki script consists of 30 letters:

### Phonological Processes

1. Nasalization: Vowels are often nasalized when adjacent to nasal consonants.
   Example: **ᱥᱤᱧ** (siñ) [sĩɲ] “day”

2. Voicing assimilation: Voiced consonants become voiceless before voiceless consonants.
   Example: **ᱟᱫ ᱠᱟᱛᱮ** (ad kate) [at̪ kat̪e] “having said”

3. Glide insertion: A glide [j] is often inserted between vowels to avoid hiatus.
   Example: **ᱫᱤᱭᱟᱹ** (diã) [d̪ijɑ̃] “water”

4. Final devoicing: Word-final obstruents are often devoiced.
   Example: **ᱜᱚᱜ** (gog) [ɡɔk] “to die”

## Morphology

Santali is an agglutinative language, with a rich system of affixes that attach to roots to form words.

### Nouns

Nouns in Santali are inflected for number, case, and definiteness.

#### Number

Santali distinguishes between singular and plural. The plural is typically formed by adding the suffix **-ᱠᱚ** (-ko):

- **ᱦᱚᱲ** (hoṛ) “person” → **ᱦᱚᱲᱠᱚ** (hoṛko) “people”
- **ᱵᱟᱦᱟ** (baha) “flower” → **ᱵᱟᱦᱟᱠᱚ** (bahako) “flowers”

#### Case

Santali has a rich case system. Here are some of the most common cases:

1. Nominative (unmarked): **ᱦᱚᱲ** (hoṛ) “person”
2. Accusative: **-ᱮ** (-e) or **-ᱠᱮ** (-ke)
   Example: **ᱦᱚᱲᱮ** (hoṛe) “person (object)”
3. Genitive: **-ᱨᱮᱱ** (-ren) or **-ᱟᱜ** (-ag)
   Example: **ᱦᱚᱲᱨᱮᱱ** (hoṛren) “of the person”
4. Dative: **-ᱛᱮ** (-te)
   Example: **ᱦᱚᱲᱛᱮ** (hoṛte) “to the person”
5. Locative: **-ᱨᱮ** (-re)
   Example: **ᱚᱲᱟᱜᱨᱮ** (oṛagre) “in the house”
6. Instrumental: **-ᱛᱮ** (-te)
   Example: **ᱫᱟᱹᱲᱛᱮ** (dãṛte) “with an axe”

#### Definiteness

Definiteness is marked by the suffix **-ᱟ** (-a):

- **ᱦᱚᱲ** (hoṛ) “person” → **ᱦᱚᱲᱟ** (hoṛa) “the person”

### Pronouns

Santali has a complex pronoun system that distinguishes between inclusive and exclusive first person plural forms.

| Person | Singular | Plural (Inclusive) | Plural (Exclusive) |
|--------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1st | **ᱤᱧ** (iñ) | **ᱟᱵᱚ** (abo) | **ᱟᱞᱮ** (ale) |
| 2nd | **ᱟᱢ** (am) | **ᱟᱯᱮ** (ape) | - |
| 3rd | **ᱩᱱᱤ** (uni) | **ᱩᱱᱠᱩ** (unku) | - |

Examples:
- **ᱤᱧ ᱥᱮᱱᱚᱜᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ senog-ã) “I am going”
- **ᱟᱵᱚ ᱥᱮᱱᱚᱜᱼᱵᱚᱱ** (abo senog-bon) “We (including you) are going”
- **ᱟᱞᱮ ᱥᱮᱱᱚᱜᱼᱞᱮ** (ale senog-le) “We (excluding you) are going”

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Santali typically precede the nouns they modify and do not agree in gender or number:

- **ᱢᱟᱨᱟᱝ ᱚᱲᱟᱜ** (maraŋ oṛag) “big house”
- **ᱢᱟᱨᱟᱝ ᱚᱲᱟᱜᱠᱚ** (maraŋ oṛagko) “big houses”

Comparative and superlative forms are formed analytically:

- Comparative: **ᱠᱷᱚᱱ** (khon) “than”
  Example: **ᱱᱚᱶᱟ ᱚᱱᱟ ᱠᱷᱚᱱ ᱢᱟᱨᱟᱝᱟ** (nowa ona khon maraŋa) “This is bigger than that”

- Superlative: **ᱡᱚᱛᱚ ᱠᱷᱚᱱ** (joto khon) “most”
  Example: **ᱱᱚᱶᱟ ᱡᱚᱛᱚ ᱠᱷᱚᱱ ᱢᱟᱨᱟᱝᱟ** (nowa joto khon maraŋa) “This is the biggest”

### Verbs

Santali verbs are highly inflected, marking tense, aspect, mood, and person/number agreement.

#### Tense and Aspect

Santali distinguishes three main tenses: present, past, and future. These interact with aspectual distinctions to create a complex system of verb forms.

1. Present tense:
   - Simple present: **-ᱟ** (-a)
     Example: **ᱤᱧ ᱡᱚᱢᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ jom-ã) “I eat”
   - Present progressive: **-ᱮᱫ** (-ed)
     Example: **ᱤᱧ ᱡᱚᱢᱼᱮᱫᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ jom-ed-ã) “I am eating”

2. Past tense:
   - Simple past: **-ᱠᱮᱫ** (-ked)
     Example: **ᱤᱧ ᱡᱚᱢᱼᱠᱮᱫᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ jom-ked-ã) “I ate”
   - Past progressive: **-ᱮᱫ ᱛᱟᱦᱮᱸᱠᱟᱱ** (-ed tahẽkan)
     Example: **ᱤᱧ ᱡᱚᱢᱼᱮᱫ ᱛᱟᱦᱮᱸᱠᱟᱱᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ jom-ed tahẽkan-ã) “I was eating”
   - Perfect: **-ᱟᱠᱟᱫ** (-akad)
     Example: **ᱤᱧ ᱡᱚᱢᱼᱟᱠᱟᱫᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ jom-akad-ã) “I have eaten”

3. Future tense:
   - Simple future: **-ᱟᱹ** (-ã)
     Example: **ᱤᱧ ᱡᱚᱢᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ jom-ã) “I will eat”
   - Immediate future: **-ᱮᱭ** (-ey)
     Example: **ᱤᱧ ᱡᱚᱢᱼᱮᱭᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ jom-ey-ã) “I am about to eat”

#### Mood

Santali verbs also express various moods:

1. Indicative (unmarked): **ᱤᱧ ᱡᱚᱢᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ jom-ã) “I eat/will eat”

2. Imperative:
   - 2nd person singular: **-ᱢᱮ** (-me)
     Example: **ᱡᱚᱢᱼᱢᱮ** (jom-me) “Eat!”
   - 2nd person plural: **-ᱯᱮ** (-pe)
     Example: **ᱡᱚᱢᱼᱯᱮ** (jom-pe) “Eat!” (plural)

3. Subjunctive: **-ᱞᱮᱠᱷᱟᱱ** (-lekhan)
   Example: **ᱤᱧ ᱡᱚᱢᱼᱞᱮᱠᱷᱟᱱ** (iñ jom-lekhan) “If I eat”

4. Conditional: **-ᱠᱷᱟᱱ** (-khan)
   Example: **ᱤᱧ ᱡᱚᱢᱼᱠᱷᱟᱱ** (iñ jom-khan) “If I were to eat”

#### Person and Number Agreement

Santali verbs agree with their subjects in person and number. This agreement is marked by suffixes that follow the tense/aspect markers:

1. First person:
   - Singular: **-ᱟᱹᱧ** (-ãñ)
   - Plural (inclusive): **-ᱵᱚᱱ** (-bon)
   - Plural (exclusive): **-ᱞᱮ** (-le)

2. Second person:
   - Singular: **-ᱢ** (-m)
   - Plural: **-ᱯᱮ** (-pe)

3. Third person:
   - Singular: **-ᱮ** (-e) (animate), **-ᱟ** (-a) (inanimate)
   - Plural: **-ᱠᱚ** (-ko)

Examples:
- **ᱤᱧ ᱥᱮᱱᱚᱜᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ senog-ãñ) “I go”
- **ᱟᱞᱮ ᱥᱮᱱᱚᱜᱼᱞᱮ** (ale senog-le) “We (excl.) go”
- **ᱟᱢ ᱥᱮᱱᱚᱜᱼᱢ** (am senog-m) “You go”
- **ᱩᱱᱤ ᱥᱮᱱᱚᱜᱼᱮ** (uni senog-e) “He/She goes”
- **ᱚᱱᱟ ᱥᱮᱱᱚᱜᱼᱟ** (ona senog-a) “It goes”
- **ᱩᱱᱠᱩ ᱥᱮᱱᱚᱜᱼᱠᱚ** (unku senog-ko) “They go”

#### Negation

Verb negation in Santali is typically expressed by the particle **ᱵᱟᱝ** (baŋ) before the verb:

- **ᱤᱧ ᱵᱟᱝ ᱥᱮᱱᱚᱜᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ baŋ senog-ãñ) “I don’t go”

In some tenses, the negative form is integrated into the verb:

- **ᱤᱧ ᱵᱟᱝ ᱥᱮᱱ ᱞᱮᱱᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ baŋ sen len-ãñ) “I didn't go”

#### Causative

Santali has a productive causative form, created by adding the suffix **-ᱚᱪᱚ** (-oco) to the verb root:

- **ᱡᱚᱢ** (jom) “to eat” → **ᱡᱚᱢᱚᱪᱚ** (jomoco) “to feed, to make eat”
- **ᱧᱮᱞ** (ñel) “to see” → **ᱧᱮᱞᱚᱪᱚ** (ñeloco) “to show, to make see”

### Adverbs

Adverbs in Santali can be formed from adjectives by adding the suffix **-ᱛᱮ** (-te):

- **ᱢᱟᱨᱟᱝ** (maraŋ) “big” → **ᱢᱟᱨᱟᱝᱛᱮ** (maraŋte) “greatly”
- **ᱵᱮᱥ** (bes) “good” → **ᱵᱮᱥᱛᱮ** (beste) “well”

Many adverbs, however, are independent words:

- **ᱛᱤᱱᱟᱹᱜ** (tinãg) “when”
- **ᱚᱠᱟᱨᱮ** (okare) “where”
- **ᱪᱮᱫᱟᱜ** (cedag) “why”

## Syntax

Santali generally follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, although this can be flexible for emphasis or in certain constructions.

### Basic Sentence Structure

A typical Santali sentence follows this pattern:

Subject + (Indirect Object) + (Direct Object) + Verb

Example:
**ᱤᱧ ᱜᱤᱫᱽᱨᱟᱹ ᱯᱚᱛᱚᱵ ᱮᱢᱟᱫᱮᱭᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ gidrã potob emadeyãñ)
“I gave the child a book”

Literal gloss: I + child + book + gave-to-him/her-I

### Question Formation

Questions in Santali are typically formed by adding question words or particles:

1. Yes/No questions: Add **ᱥᱮ** (se) at the end of a statement
   Example: **ᱟᱢ ᱥᱮᱱᱚᱜᱼᱟᱢ ᱥᱮ?** (am senog-am se?) “Are you going?”

2. Wh-questions: Use question words in situ
   Example: **ᱟᱢ ᱚᱠᱟᱨᱮ ᱥᱮᱱᱚᱜᱼᱟᱢ?** (am okare senog-am?) “Where are you going?”

Common question words:
- **ᱚᱠᱚᱭ** (okoy) “who”
- **ᱪᱮᱫ** (ced) “what”
- **ᱚᱠᱟᱨᱮ** (okare) “where”
- **ᱛᱤᱱᱟᱹᱜ** (tinãg) “when”
- **ᱪᱮᱫᱟᱜ** (cedag) “why”
- **ᱪᱮᱠᱟᱛᱮ** (cekate) “how”

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses in Santali typically precede the noun they modify and are marked by the relative pronoun **ᱡᱟᱦᱟᱸᱭ** (jahãy) for animate referents or **ᱡᱟᱦᱟᱸ** (jahã) for inanimate referents:

**ᱡᱟᱦᱟᱸᱭ ᱦᱚᱲ ᱧᱮᱞ ᱠᱮᱫᱮᱭᱟᱹᱧ, ᱩᱱᱤ ᱦᱮᱡ ᱮᱱᱟ** (jahãy hoṛ ñel kedeãñ, uni hej ena)
“The person whom I saw has come”

Literal gloss: Whom + person + see + did-I, that-one + come + has

### Coordination and Subordination

Coordination is often achieved through simple juxtaposition or with conjunctions:

- **ᱟᱨ** (ar) “and”
- **ᱥᱮ** (se) “or”
- **ᱢᱮᱱᱠᱷᱟᱱ** (menkhan) “but”

Example:
**ᱤᱧ ᱡᱚᱢᱼᱟᱹᱧ ᱟᱨ ᱧᱩᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (iñ jom-ãñ ar ñu-ãñ) “I eat and drink”

Subordination is often marked by specific suffixes or conjunctions:

- **ᱠᱷᱟᱱ** (-khan) “if”
- **ᱡᱚᱠᱷᱚᱱ** (jokhon) “when”
- **ᱡᱮᱢᱚᱱ** (jemon) “so that”

Example:
**ᱤᱧ ᱥᱮᱱᱚᱜᱼᱟᱹᱧ ᱠᱷᱟᱱ, ᱟᱢ ᱦᱚᱸ ᱦᱤᱡᱩᱜᱼᱢᱮ** (iñ senog-ãñ khan, am hõ hijug-me)
“If I go, you come too”

### Topic-Comment Structure

Santali often employs a topic-comment structure, where the topic of the sentence is fronted and marked by the particle **ᱫᱚ** (do):

**ᱱᱚᱶᱟ ᱯᱚᱛᱚᱵ ᱫᱚ ᱤᱧ ᱯᱟᱲᱦᱟᱣ ᱟᱠᱟᱫᱼᱟᱹᱧ** (nowa potob do iñ paṛhaw akad-ãñ)
“As for this book, I have read it”
