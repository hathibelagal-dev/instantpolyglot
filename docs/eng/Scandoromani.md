# Scandoromani

Scandoromani, also known as Scandinavian Romani or Tavringer Romani, is a mixed language spoken by the Romani people in Scandinavia.

## Sociolinguistic Situation

Scandoromani is primarily used within Romani communities in Scandinavia, often as a way to maintain cultural identity and communicate privately. Its usage varies among different age groups and regions.

### Intergenerational Transmission

The transmission of Scandoromani to younger generations has been declining, contributing to its endangered status. Many younger Romani individuals in Scandinavia are more fluent in the dominant Scandinavian language of their country.

### Code-switching

Code-switching between Scandoromani and the local Scandinavian language is common among speakers. This often occurs mid-sentence or when discussing certain topics:

**Me ska gå til skolan för att dikka miro pral.** (I will go to school to see my brother.)

Here, "skolan" (school) and "för att" (in order to) are Scandinavian, while "dikka" (see) and "pral" (brother) are Romani.

### Register and Formality

Scandoromani is primarily used in informal, familial contexts. In formal situations, speakers typically switch to the dominant Scandinavian language. However, some formal expressions exist in Scandoromani:

- **Lačho dives, raija ta ranija.** (Good day, ladies and gentlemen.)
- **Me mangav te palikrav tuke.** (I want to thank you.)

## Writing System

Scandoromani does not have a standardized writing system. When written, it typically uses the Latin alphabet as used in Scandinavian languages, including letters like å, ä, and ö.

Some attempts at standardization have been made, but these are not widely adopted. Writing conventions often vary based on the writer's background and the specific Scandinavian language they're most familiar with.

Example text in Scandoromani (Swedish variant):

**En gång för länge sen dživde jek barvalo rom ta leski romni. De hadde jek tikno čhavo som hette Johan. Johan kamde te džal avri ta dikka i verdanen, men lesko dad phenade att det var för farligt. En dag, när leske dadeske ta daiske sode, Johan smygte sig ut ta dživde många äventyr i gaven.**

(Once upon a time, there lived a rich Roma man and his wife. They had a little son named Johan. Johan wanted to go out and see the world, but his father said it was too dangerous. One day, when his parents were sleeping, Johan snuck out and had many adventures in the village.)
