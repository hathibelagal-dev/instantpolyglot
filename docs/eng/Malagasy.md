# Malagasy

Malagasy is an Austronesian language spoken by approximately 25 million people, primarily in Madagascar. It is the national language of Madagascar and one of the country's two official languages alongside French. Despite its geographical location off the coast of East Africa, Malagasy is most closely related to languages spoken in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia. This unique linguistic heritage reflects the historical migration of Austronesian peoples to Madagascar around 1,500 years ago.

## Phonology and Orthography

Malagasy uses the Latin alphabet, with 21 letters. The orthography is largely phonemic, meaning there is a close correspondence between spelling and pronunciation. This system was developed in the 19th century by European missionaries, particularly the London Missionary Society, in collaboration with native Malagasy speakers.

### Consonants

Malagasy has 21 consonant phonemes:

| Letter | IPA | Description | Example |
|--------|-----|-------------|---------|
| b | [b] | voiced bilabial plosive | **boky** [ˈbukʲ] (book) |
| d | [d] | voiced alveolar plosive | **didy** [ˈdidʲ] (law) |
| f | [f] | voiceless labiodental fricative | **fary** [ˈfarʲ] (sugarcane) |
| g | [g] | voiced velar plosive | **gidro** [ˈgidru] (lemur) |
| h | [h] | voiceless glottal fricative | **hafa** [ˈhafa] (different) |
| j | [dz] | voiced alveolar affricate | **jiro** [ˈdziru] (lamp) |
| k | [k] | voiceless velar plosive | **kaly** [ˈkalʲ] (scorpion) |
| l | [l] | alveolar lateral approximant | **lalana** [laˈlana] (road) |
| m | [m] | bilabial nasal | **mofo** [ˈmufu] (bread) |
| n | [n] | alveolar nasal | **nify** [ˈnifʲ] (tooth) |
| p | [p] | voiceless bilabial plosive | **parasy** [paˈrasʲ] (brush) |
| r | [r] | alveolar trill | **rano** [ˈranu] (water) |
| s | [s] | voiceless alveolar fricative | **soa** [ˈsuwa] (good) |
| t | [t] | voiceless alveolar plosive | **tany** [ˈtanʲ] (earth) |
| v | [v] | voiced labiodental fricative | **vary** [ˈvarʲ] (rice) |
| z | [z] | voiced alveolar fricative | **zaza** [ˈzaza] (child) |

Additionally, Malagasy has several consonant phonemes represented by digraphs:

| Digraph | IPA | Description | Example |
|---------|-----|-------------|---------|
| tr | [ʈʂ] | voiceless retroflex affricate | **trano** [ˈʈʂanu] (house) |
| dr | [ɖʐ] | voiced retroflex affricate | **drano** [ˈɖʐanu] (water) |
| ts | [ts] | voiceless alveolar affricate | **tsara** [ˈtsara] (good) |

### Vowels

Malagasy has a simple vowel system with four phonemic vowels:

| Letter | IPA | Description | Example |
|--------|-----|-------------|---------|
| a | [a] | open front unrounded vowel | **ady** [ˈadʲ] (fight) |
| e | [e] | close-mid front unrounded vowel | **be** [be] (big) |
| i | [i] | close front unrounded vowel | **ity** [ˈitʲ] (this) |
| o | [u] | close back rounded vowel | **foto** [ˈfutu] (origin) |

Note that the letter 'o' represents the sound [u] in Malagasy, which can be confusing for learners.

### Diphthongs

Malagasy has several diphthongs:

- **ai** [aj]: **mainty** [ˈmajntʲ] (black)
- **ao** [aw]: **aoka** [ˈawka] (let)
- **oi** [uj]: **amoizoina** [amujˈzujna] (to be imagined)

### Semi-vowels

The letter 'y' typically functions as a consonant [j], not a vowel:

- **lalao** [laˈlaw] (game)
- **izy** [ˈizʲ] (he/she)

### Stress

Stress in Malagasy typically falls on the penultimate syllable. For example:

- **trano** [ˈʈʂanu] (house)
- **fitiavana** [fitiˈavana] (love)

However, words ending in -ka, -tra, or -na often have stress on the antepenultimate syllable:

- **tanàna** [ˈtanana] (town)
- **vorona** [ˈvuruna] (bird)

In some cases, stress can be phonemic, distinguishing between otherwise identical words:

- **tanàna** [ˈtanana] (town) vs. **tanana** [taˈnana] (hand)

### Orthographic Notes

1. Stress is sometimes indicated with a grave accent (à) on the stressed syllable when it's not the penultimate.
2. The letter 'y' is used both as a consonant [j] and to indicate palatalization of the preceding consonant.
3. Long vowels are sometimes written with a circumflex accent: **î** [i:].

## Morphology

Malagasy is an agglutinative language, meaning that words are formed by adding affixes to roots. This morphological complexity allows for the expression of nuanced meanings through the combination of various affixes.

### Nouns

Nouns in Malagasy do not inflect for number or gender. Plurality is often indicated by context or by adding quantifiers.

#### Definiteness

Definiteness is marked by the article **ny**:

- **alika** (a dog)
- **ny alika** (the dog)

The indefinite article **ilay** is used for specific but indefinite nouns:

- **ilay alika** (that dog, the aforementioned dog)

#### Possession

Possession is indicated by adding possessive suffixes to the noun:

- **trano** (house)
- **tranoko** (my house)
- **tranonao** (your house)
- **tranontsika** (our house, inclusive)
- **tranonay** (our house, exclusive)
- **tranonareo** (your house, plural)
- **tranony** (his/her/their house)

For alienable possession, the genitive particle **-n** is used:

- **bokin'i Soa** (Soa's book)

#### Compound Nouns

Compound nouns are common in Malagasy and are typically formed by combining two nouns:

- **vato** (stone) + **maty** (dead) = **vatomaty** (fossil)
- **loha** (head) + **rano** (water) = **loharano** (spring, source)

### Verbs

Malagasy verbs are complex, with a rich system of voice and aspect. They can be classified into three main types based on their root form:

1. Roots beginning with consonants
2. Roots beginning with vowels
3. Roots beginning with 'm'

#### Tense

Malagasy has three main tenses:

1. Past: marked by the prefix **n-** or **no-**
2. Present: unmarked
3. Future: marked by the prefix **h-** or **ho-**

Examples with the root **teny** (speak):

Examples with the root **vaky** (break):

- **mamaky** (to break, AT)
- **vakina** (to be broken, TT)
- **ivakiana** (to be broken with, CT)

The choice of voice affects the focus of the sentence:

- AT: **Mamaky boky aho.** (I read a book.)
- TT: **Vakiko ny boky.** (The book is read by me.)
- CT: **Amakiako boky ny ankizy.** (I read a book to the children.)

#### Aspect

Some common adverbs:

- **tena** (very, really)
- **koa** (also)

## Syntax

### Basic Word Order

The basic word order in Malagasy is Verb-Object-Subject (VOS):

**Mamaky boky ny mpianatra.**
read    book  the student
“The student reads a book.”

This word order is relatively rare among the world's languages, found in only about 3% of documented languages.

### Topic-Comment Structure

While the basic word order is VOS, Malagasy often uses a topic-comment structure, where the topic is fronted and marked with the particle **dia**:

**Ny mpianatra dia mamaky boky.**
the student   TOP read    book
“As for the student, (he) reads a book.”

### Question Formation

Questions are typically formed by adding the particle **ve** at the end of a statement:

**Mamaky boky ny mpianatra ve?**
“Does the student read a book?”

Wh-questions use question words such as:

- **iza** (who)
- **inona** (what)
- **aiza** (where)
- **oviana** (when)
- **ahoana** (how)

These usually appear at the end of the sentence:

**Mamaky inona ny mpianatra?**
“What does the student read?”

### Negation

Negation is formed by using **tsy** before the verb:

**Tsy mamaky boky ny mpianatra.**
“The student does not read a book.”

Double negation is possible and common:

**Tsy mamaky boky mihitsy ny mpianatra.**
“The student does not read a book at all.”

### Relative Clauses

Relative clauses are typically introduced by **izay**:

**Ny boky izay novakin'ny mpianatra**
“The book that was read by the student”

In spoken Malagasy, **izay** is often omitted:

**Ny boky novakin'ny mpianatra**
“The book (that) was read by the student”

### Serial Verb Constructions

Malagasy allows for serial verb constructions, where multiple verbs are used in sequence without conjunctions:

**Nitsangana niresaka izy.**
stood up   spoke    he
“He stood up and spoke.”

### Causatives

Causatives are formed by adding the prefix **amp-** to the verb:

- **miasa** (to work) → **mampiasa** (to make work, to employ)
- **mianatra** (to study) → **mampianatra** (to teach)

### Reciprocals

Reciprocal actions are indicated by the prefix **mifamp-**:

- **mifampianatra** (to teach each other)

## Dialects

While Standard Malagasy (based on the Merina dialect) is the official language, there are numerous regional dialects:

1. Merina: spoken in the central highlands, basis for the standard language
2. Betsimisaraka: spoken on the east coast
3. Sakalava: spoken on the west coast
4. Tsimihety: spoken in the north
5. Antandroy: spoken in the south
6. Antaisaka: spoken in the southeast
7. Bara: spoken in the south-central region
8. Antankarana: spoken in the far north

These dialects can differ significantly in vocabulary and pronunciation, but are generally mutually intelligible. Some notable differences:

- Sakalava often uses [l] where Merina uses [d]: **lapa** vs. **dapa** (palace)
- Betsimisaraka tends to drop final nasals: **taona** → **tao** (year)
- Antandroy has retained some consonant clusters lost in other dialects: **hambogna** vs. Merina **ambony** (high)

## Colloquial Malagasy

Colloquial Malagasy often differs from the standard written form:

- Shortened forms: **'lay** instead of **ilay** (the)
- Informal pronouns: **'aho** instead of **izaho** (I)
- Slang terms: **mahita banga** (to be hungry, literally “to see emptiness”)
- Reduplication for emphasis: **mora mora** (very cheap, from **mora** “cheap”)

Common colloquial expressions:

- **Manao ahoana?** (How are you?)
- **Inona no vaovao?** (What's new?)
- **Mazotoa!** (Enjoy your meal!)
- **Veloma!** (Goodbye!)

## Language Contact and Code-Switching

Due to the bilingual nature of many Malagasy speakers (with French as the second language), code-switching is common, especially in urban areas:

**Handeha any am-piasana aho ce matin.**
(I will go to work this morning - mixing Malagasy and French)

## Writing System and Literature

The Malagasy alphabet, called Sorabe, was developed in the 19th century based on the Latin script. Before this, Malagasy was written in Arabic script (also called Sorabe) by some communities, particularly in the southeast.

Malagasy literature includes a rich tradition of oral folklore, as well as written works:

- **Ibonia**: an epic poem considered one of the oldest pieces of Malagasy literature
- **Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara** (History of the Nobles in Madagascar): a historical work by François Callet
- Modern authors like Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo and Elie Rajaonarison have contributed to Malagasy poetry and prose

## Language Policy and Education

Malagasy is the national language of Madagascar and is used as the medium of instruction in primary schools. However, French remains important in higher education and administration.

The government has implemented policies to promote Malagasy:

- The Malagasy Academy (Akademia Malagasy) was established in 1902 to study and promote the language
- Efforts to standardize terminology, especially for scientific and technical fields

## Challenges and Future Prospects

Malagasy faces several challenges:

1. Influence of French and English, particularly in urban areas and media
2. Need for modernization of vocabulary for technical and scientific domains
3. Balancing standardization with preservation of dialectal diversity

However, there are also positive developments:

1. Increasing use of Malagasy in digital spaces, including social media and websites
2. Growing interest in Malagasy language and culture among the diaspora
3. Efforts to document and preserve lesser-known dialects

## Conclusion

Malagasy is a fascinating language that reflects the unique history and cultural diversity of Madagascar. Its Austronesian roots, combined with influences from African, Arabic, and European languages, have resulted in a rich and complex linguistic system. As Madagascar continues to develop and engage with the global community, the Malagasy language will undoubtedly evolve, presenting both challenges and opportunities for linguists, educators, and speakers alike.
