# Turkmen

Turkmen (Türkmençe) is a Turkic language spoken primarily in Turkmenistan, where it is the official state language. It is also spoken by significant minority populations in Iran, Afghanistan, and other neighboring countries. Turkmen belongs to the Oghuz branch of Turkic languages, closely related to Turkish and Azerbaijani.

## Alphabet and Pronunciation

Turkmen uses a modified Latin alphabet, which was officially adopted in 1993 to replace the Cyrillic script. The current alphabet consists of 32 letters:

A a, B b, Ç ç, D d, E e, Ä ä, F f, G g, H h, I i, J j, Ž ž, K k, L l, M m, N n, Ň ň, O o, Ö ö, P p, R r, S s, Ş ş, T t, U u, Ü ü, W w, Y y, Ý ý, Z z

### Vowels

Turkmen has 8 vowel phonemes:

1. Front/back harmony: 
   - Front vowels: e, ä, i, ö, ü
   - Back vowels: a, y, o, u

2. Rounded/unrounded harmony:

### Final Devoicing

Voiced consonants at the end of words are often devoiced in pronunciation:

- **ýigit** (young man) is pronounced [ýigit̚] (with a devoiced final [t])

## Word Formation

- **günbatar** (west) = **gün** (sun) + **batmak** (to set)

### Derivation

New words are formed by adding suffixes to existing words:

- **iş** (work) + **-çi** → **işçi** (worker)
- **ýaş** (young) + **-lyk** → **ýaşlyk** (youth)

### Reduplication

Partial or full repetition of words for emphasis or to create new meanings:

   Meaning: Unity is strength; one person alone can't achieve much.

## Literary Turkmen

Literary Turkmen, used in formal writing and literature, may differ from everyday spoken Turkmen in several ways:

1. More complex sentence structures
2. Use of less common vocabulary
3. Higher frequency of Persian and Arabic loanwords
4. More frequent use of participles and verbal nouns
5. Stricter adherence to standard grammar rules

Example of literary Turkmen:

**Ýaşyl ýaprakly agaçlaryň arasyndan süzülip geçýän günüň altyn şöhleleri, ýaňy oýanan tebigatyň gözelligini has-da artdyrýardy.**

(The golden rays of the sun, filtering through the trees with green leaves, enhanced the beauty of the newly awakened nature even more.)

In conclusion, Turkmen is a rich and complex language with a long history and cultural significance. Its agglutinative structure, vowel harmony, and extensive system of suffixes make it a fascinating subject for linguistic study. While it shares many features with other Turkic languages, it has its own unique characteristics shaped by its history and the cultural context of Turkmenistan.
