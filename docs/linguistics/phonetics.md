# Introduction to Phonetics

Phonetics is the scientific study of the sounds of human speech. It examines how these sounds are produced, transmitted, and perceived. This field is crucial for language learners, linguists, speech therapists, and anyone interested in understanding the mechanics of spoken language. Phonetics provides a foundation for studying phonology, which deals with how sounds function within a language system.

## Sound Production

Speech sounds are produced by manipulating the flow of air from the lungs through the vocal tract. The main components involved in sound production are:

1. Lungs: Provide the airstream necessary for speech
2. Larynx: Contains the vocal folds (cords) that can vibrate to produce voiced sounds
3. Oral cavity: Includes the tongue, teeth, and lips, which shape the sound
4. Nasal cavity: Allows air to pass through the nose for nasal sounds

### Airstream Mechanisms

There are several ways in which the airstream can be initiated and modified:

1. Pulmonic egressive: Air flows outward from the lungs (most common)
2. Pulmonic ingressive: Air flows inward to the lungs (rare, used in some interjections)
3. Glottalic egressive: Air is compressed in the oral cavity (ejectives)
4. Glottalic ingressive: Air is rarefied in the oral cavity (implosives)
5. Velaric ingressive: Air is rarefied in the oral cavity with the velum closed (clicks)

### Voicing

Sounds can be either voiced or voiceless:

- Voiced sounds: Vocal folds vibrate (e.g., [b], [z], [v], [m], [l])
- Voiceless sounds: Vocal folds do not vibrate (e.g., [p], [s], [f], [t], [k])

Example:
- **buzz** [bʌz] (all voiced sounds)
- **puff** [pʌf] (all voiceless sounds)

Voicing can be partially or fully present. Some languages distinguish between fully voiced, partially voiced, and voiceless sounds.

### Places of Articulation

The place of articulation refers to where in the vocal tract the airflow is obstructed or modified. Common places include:

1. Bilabial: Both lips (e.g., [p], [b], [m])
2. Labiodental: Lower lip and upper teeth (e.g., [f], [v])
3. Dental: Tongue tip and upper teeth (e.g., [θ], [ð] in English "thin" and "this")
4. Alveolar: Tongue tip and alveolar ridge (e.g., [t], [d], [s], [z])
5. Postalveolar: Tongue blade and back of alveolar ridge (e.g., [ʃ], [ʒ] in English "ship" and "measure")
6. Retroflex: Curled-back tongue tip (e.g., [ʈ], [ɖ] in some Indian languages)
7. Palatal: Tongue body and hard palate (e.g., [j] in English "yes", [ç] in German "ich")
8. Velar: Tongue back and soft palate (e.g., [k], [g], [ŋ])
9. Uvular: Tongue back and uvula (e.g., [q], [ʀ] in French "Paris")
10. Pharyngeal: Tongue root and pharynx wall (e.g., [ħ], [ʕ] in Arabic)
11. Glottal: Constriction at the vocal folds (e.g., [h], [ʔ] glottal stop)

Some sounds involve multiple places of articulation:

- Labial-velar: Simultaneous labial and velar closure (e.g., [w], [kp], [gb] in some African languages)
- Labial-palatal: Simultaneous labial and palatal articulation (e.g., [ɥ] in French "huit")

### Manners of Articulation

The manner of articulation describes how the airflow is modified. Common manners include:

1. Plosives/Stops: Complete closure followed by release (e.g., [p], [t], [k], [b], [d], [g])
2. Nasals: Complete oral closure with lowered velum, allowing air to flow through the nose (e.g., [m], [n], [ŋ])
3. Fricatives: Partial closure creating friction (e.g., [f], [v], [s], [z], [ʃ], [ʒ], [θ], [ð])
4. Affricates: Stop followed by homorganic fricative release (e.g., [tʃ], [dʒ] in English "church" and "judge", [ts], [dz])
5. Approximants: Slight constriction without friction (e.g., [w], [j], [ɹ])
6. Lateral approximants: Air flows around the sides of the tongue (e.g., [l])
7. Trills: Rapid vibration of an articulator (e.g., [r] in Spanish "perro", [ʀ] in French "Paris")
8. Taps/Flaps: Brief contact between articulators (e.g., [ɾ] in Spanish "pero" or American English "butter")
9. Lateral fricatives: Frication occurs at the sides of the tongue (e.g., [ɬ], [ɮ] in Welsh)

Some languages have additional manners of articulation:

- Clicks: Found in some African languages (e.g., [ǀ], [ǂ], [ǃ])
- Implosives: Glottalic ingressive sounds (e.g., [ɓ], [ɗ] in some African languages)
- Ejectives: Glottalic egressive sounds (e.g., [p'], [t'], [k'] in some Native American and Caucasian languages)

## Vowels

Vowels are produced with an open vocal tract, allowing air to flow freely. They are characterized by:

1. Tongue height: High, mid, or low
2. Tongue position: Front, central, or back
3. Lip rounding: Rounded or unrounded
4. Tenseness: Tense or lax (in some languages)

Common vowel symbols include:

- [i]: High front unrounded (as in "beat")
- [u]: High back rounded (as in "boot")
- [a]: Low central unrounded (as in "father")
- [ə]: Mid central unrounded (schwa, as in "about")
- [ɛ]: Mid-low front unrounded (as in "bet")
- [ɔ]: Mid-low back rounded (as in "bought" in some dialects)
- [y]: High front rounded (as in French "tu")
- [ø]: Mid front rounded (as in French "deux")

Vowels can also be:
- Monophthongs: Single vowel sound (e.g., [i], [u], [a])
- Diphthongs: Combination of two vowel sounds (e.g., [aɪ] in "bite", [aʊ] in "bout", [ɔɪ] in "boy")
- Triphthongs: Combination of three vowel sounds (e.g., [aʊə] in "power" in some dialects)

Additional vowel features:
- Nasalization: Air flows through both the mouth and nose (e.g., [ã], [ɛ̃] in French)
- Length: Some languages distinguish between short and long vowels (e.g., [a] vs. [aː])
- Creaky voice: Produced with a distinctive vocal fold vibration (e.g., in some tonal languages)

The vowel space is often represented using a vowel chart, which shows the relative positions of vowels based on tongue height and backness.

## The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

The IPA is a standardized system for representing speech sounds across languages. It uses unique symbols for each distinct sound, allowing for precise transcription of pronunciation. The IPA is based on the Latin alphabet with additional symbols and diacritics.

Key features of the IPA:
1. Each symbol represents a single sound
2. Diacritics modify the base symbols to indicate additional features
3. Suprasegmental features (stress, tone, intonation) can be marked
4. Both narrow (detailed) and broad (phonemic) transcriptions are possible

Example IPA transcriptions:

- English: "The quick brown fox" [ðə kwɪk braʊn fɒks]
- French: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?" [bɔ̃ʒuʁ kɔmɑ̃t‿ale vu]
- German: "Ich heiße Hans" [ɪç ˈhaɪsə hans]
- Spanish: "¿Cómo te llamas?" [ˈkomo te ˈʝamas]
- Mandarin Chinese: "你好" (Hello) [ni˥˩ xɑʊ̯˧˥]

IPA symbols are grouped into categories:
- Pulmonic consonants
- Non-pulmonic consonants
- Vowels
- Diacritics
- Suprasegmentals
- Tones and word accents

Learning the IPA is valuable for language learners, as it provides a consistent way to represent pronunciation across languages.

## Suprasegmental Features

Suprasegmental features extend beyond individual sounds (segments) and include:

### Stress

Stress refers to the emphasis placed on certain syllables within words or phrases. It can involve changes in pitch, loudness, or duration. Languages vary in how they use stress:

- Fixed stress: Stress always falls on a particular syllable (e.g., Finnish: first syllable, Polish: penultimate syllable)
- Free stress: Stress can fall on different syllables and may be lexically contrastive

Examples of contrastive stress in English:
- **record** (noun) ['rekərd] vs. **record** (verb) [rɪ'kɔːrd]
- **import** (noun) ['ɪmpɔːrt] vs. **import** (verb) [ɪm'pɔːrt]
- **present** (noun/adjective) ['prezənt] vs. **present** (verb) [prɪ'zent]

### Intonation

Intonation is the rise and fall of pitch in speech. It can convey grammatical information, emotion, or pragmatic meaning. Intonation patterns vary across languages and dialects.

Functions of intonation:
1. Grammatical: Distinguishing sentence types (e.g., statements vs. questions)
2. Attitudinal: Expressing emotions or attitudes
3. Focusing: Highlighting important information
4. Discourse regulation: Managing turn-taking in conversation

Examples of intonation patterns in English:
- Statement: "It's raining." (falling intonation)
- Yes/No question: "Is it raining?" (rising intonation)
- Wh-question: "Where is it raining?" (falling intonation)
- List intonation: "I need eggs, milk, and bread." (rise on each item except the last)

### Tone

Some languages use pitch differences to distinguish word meanings. These are called tonal languages. Tones can be:

1. Level tones: Pitch remains steady
2. Contour tones: Pitch changes within the syllable

Example: Mandarin Chinese tones
1. High level tone: mā (妈) "mother" [ma˥]
2. Rising tone: má (麻) "hemp" [ma˧˥]
3. Falling-rising tone: mǎ (马) "horse" [ma˨˩˦]
4. Falling tone: mà (骂) "scold" [ma˥˩]

Other tonal languages include:
- Vietnamese: 6 tones
- Thai: 5 tones
- Yoruba: 3 tones

Some languages, like Japanese and Swedish, are considered pitch-accent languages, where pitch is used to distinguish words but in a more limited way than in fully tonal languages.

### Length

Vowel or consonant length can be phonemically distinctive in some languages.

Examples:
- Japanese:
  - **kite** (来て) [kite] "come" (short [i])
  - **kiite** (聞いて) [kiːte] "listen" (long [iː])

- Finnish:
  - **tuli** [tuli] "fire"
  - **tuuli** [tuːli] "wind"
  - **tulli** [tulːi] "customs"

- Italian:
  - **fato** [ˈfaːto] "fate"
  - **fatto** [ˈfatːo] "fact"

### Rhythm

Languages can be broadly categorized based on their rhythmic properties:

1. Stress-timed languages: Stressed syllables occur at roughly equal intervals (e.g., English, German)
2. Syllable-timed languages: Each syllable has roughly equal duration (e.g., French, Spanish)
3. Mora-timed languages: Each mora (sub-syllabic unit) has roughly equal duration (e.g., Japanese)

These categories are not absolute, and languages may show characteristics of multiple types.

## Phonological Processes

Phonological processes are systematic sound changes that occur in specific environments. Understanding these processes helps explain variation in pronunciation and historical sound changes.

### Assimilation

Sounds become more similar to neighboring sounds. Types of assimilation include:

1. Regressive: A sound is influenced by a following sound
2. Progressive: A sound is influenced by a preceding sound
3. Reciprocal: Sounds influence each other

Examples:
- English "in" + suffixes:
  - **impossible** [ɪm'pɒsəbl̩] (assimilation of [n] to [m] before [p])
  - **intolerant** [ɪn'tɒlərənt] (no change before [t])
- Spanish:
  - **un peso** [um ˈpeso] "a weight" (nasal assimilation)
- French:
  - **dix** [dis] "ten" but **dix ans** [di.zɑ̃] "ten years" (voicing assimilation)

### Dissimilation

Sounds become less similar to avoid repetition.

Examples:
- Latin to Spanish:
  - Latin **arbor** → Spanish **árbol** "tree" ([r] changes to [l])
- English:
  - "February" often pronounced as [ˈfɛbjuɛɹi] instead of [ˈfɛbɹuɛɹi]

### Epenthesis

A sound is inserted between two others.

Examples:
- English loanwords in Japanese:
  - **strike** → **sutoraiku** [sɯtoɾaikɯ]
- Brazilian Portuguese:
  - **pneu** [piˈnew] "tire" (vowel insertion)

### Elision

A sound is deleted.

Examples:
- French liaison:
  - **les enfants** [le.zɑ̃.fɑ̃] ("the children", final [s] of **les** pronounced)
  - **les garçons** [le.ɡaʁ.sɔ̃] ("the boys", final [s] of **les** not pronounced)
- English casual speech:
  - "probably" → [ˈprɑbli]

### Metathesis

Sounds change position within a word.

Examples:
- Old English "thridda" → Modern English "third"
- Spanish "problema" → "probe**l**ma" in some dialects

### Lenition and Fortition

Lenition involves the weakening of sounds, while fortition involves strengthening.

Examples:
- Lenition: Latin "vita" → Spanish "vida" ([t] → [d])
- Fortition: Spanish "fuego" [ˈfweɣo] → [ˈfweɡo] in some dialects

## Phonemes and Allophones

A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound that can distinguish meaning in a language. Allophones are variants of a phoneme that don't change meaning.

Example: English /t/
- Aspirated [tʰ] in **top** [tʰɒp]
- Unaspirated [t] in **stop** [stɒp]
- Flapped [ɾ] in **butter** ['bʌɾər] (in American English)
- Glottalized [ʔ] in **button** ['bʌʔn̩] (in some dialects)

These are all allophones of the /t/ phoneme in English. The choice of allophone is determined by the phonetic environment and sometimes by dialect or speaking style.

Other examples of phonemes and allophones:

1. English /l/:
   - Clear [l] in **lip** [lɪp]
   - Dark [ɫ] in **pill** [pɪɫ]

2. Spanish /b/:
   - Stop [b] in **bomba** ['bomba] "pump"
   - Fricative [β] in **lobo** ['loβo] "wolf"

3. Japanese /h/:
   - [h] before [a], [o], [u]: **hana** [hana] "flower"
   - [ç] before [i]: **hito** [çito] "person"
   - [ɸ] before [u]: **futon** [ɸuton] "futon"

Understanding the distinction between phonemes and allophones is crucial for language learners, as it helps explain why native speakers perceive certain sound differences as significant and others as irrelevant.

## Syllable Structure

Syllables are units of pronunciation typically consisting of a vowel (nucleus) with optional consonants before (onset) and/or after (coda). The combination of nucleus and coda is called the rhyme.

Common syllable structures:
- V: **a**-pple
- CV: **to**
- VC: **up**
- CVC: **cat**
- CVCC: **task**
- CCVC: **bring**
- CCCVCC: **strengths**

Languages vary in their allowed syllable structures:
- Japanese prefers (C)V syllables
- Hawaiian allows only V and CV syllables
- English allows complex consonant clusters

Syllable weight:
- Light syllables: (C)V
- Heavy syllables: (C)VV or (C)VC
- Superheavy syllables: (C)VVC or (C)VCC

Syllable weight can be important for stress assignment and poetic meter in some languages.

Sonority Sequencing Principle:
This principle states that syllables tend to have a sonority profile that rises towards the nucleus and falls towards the edges. Sonority hierarchy (from most to least sonorous):
Vowels > Glides > Liquids > Nasals > Fricatives > Plosives

This principle explains why certain consonant clusters are more common than others.

## Coarticulation

Coarticulation refers to the overlapping of adjacent sounds in speech. This phenomenon explains why sounds are influenced by their context and why there's no one-to-one correspondence between phonemes and their physical realizations.

Types of coarticulation:
1. Anticipatory (right-to-left): Influence of a following sound
2. Perseveratory (left-to-right): Influence of a preceding sound

Examples:
1. English "green" [gɹiːn]:
   - The [ɹ] sound influences the preceding [g], resulting in lip-rounding during the production of [g]

2. Vowel nasalization:
   - In many languages, vowels become nasalized before nasal consonants
   - English "bean" [biːñ] (the vowel is slightly nasalized)

3. Lip rounding in consonants:
   - English "shoe" [ʃuː]: The [ʃ] is pronounced with rounded lips in anticipation of the following [uː]

Coarticulation is a major source of allophonic variation and plays a crucial role in connected speech processes.

## Acoustic Phonetics

Acoustic phonetics studies the physical properties of speech sounds. Key concepts include:

### Formants

Formants are concentrations of acoustic energy at specific frequencies. They are particularly important for identifying vowels.

Example: First two formants (F1 and F2) for English vowels
- [i] as in "beat": Low F1, High F2
- [a] as in "father": High F1, Low F2
- [u] as in "boot": Low F1, Low F2

Formant transitions are also important for identifying consonants, especially stops and approximants.

### Voice Onset Time (VOT)

VOT is the time between the release of a stop consonant and the onset of vocal fold vibration. It helps distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops.

Example: English initial stops
- /b/: Short VOT or negative VOT (voicing starts before or at release)
- /p/: Long positive VOT (voicing starts well after release)

Languages vary in their use of VOT:
- English distinguishes between short lag (voiced) and long lag (voiceless aspirated) stops
- French distinguishes between lead voicing (voiced) and short lag (voiceless unaspirated) stops
- Thai distinguishes three categories: lead voicing, short lag, and long lag

### Fundamental Frequency (F0)

F0 is the rate of vocal fold vibration and is perceived as pitch. It's crucial for:
- Intonation patterns
- Tone in tonal languages
- Voice quality differences

### Spectrograms

Spectrograms are visual representations of the frequency content of speech over time. They show:
- Formant structures
- Voice onset time
- Frication noise
- Pitch contours

Spectrograms are valuable tools for analyzing speech sounds and teaching pronunciation.

## Articulatory Phonetics

Articulatory phonetics focuses on how speech sounds are produced by the vocal organs. It involves studying the movements and positions of articulators.

### X-ray and MRI Studies

These imaging techniques allow researchers to observe the positions of articulators during speech production.

Example findings:
- Tongue root retraction for pharyngeal consonants
- Velum (soft palate) movement for nasal vs. oral sounds
- Lip protrusion and rounding for rounded vowels
- Tongue shape differences between [l] and [ɹ] in English

### Electropalatography (EPG)

EPG uses an artificial palate with electrodes to record tongue-palate contact during speech.

Applications:
- Studying articulation disorders
- Analyzing differences in consonant production across languages
- Providing visual feedback for language learners

### Ultrasound

Ultrasound imaging can show tongue movements during speech.

Applications:
- Studying articulation of sounds
- Providing visual feedback for language learners
- Analyzing coarticulation effects

### Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA)

EMA uses small sensors attached to articulators to track their movements in three dimensions.

Applications:
- Studying dynamic aspects of articulation
- Analyzing coarticulation and timing in speech production

## Perceptual Phonetics

Perceptual phonetics examines how listeners perceive and process speech sounds. Key areas of study include:

### Categorical Perception

Listeners tend to perceive speech sounds as distinct categories rather than a continuum.

Example: Voice Onset Time (VOT) continuum
- English speakers perceive a clear boundary between /b/ and /p/ based on VOT, even though the physical difference is gradual

This phenomenon helps explain why non-native contrasts can be difficult to perceive and produce.

### Phoneme Restoration Effect

Listeners can "hear" phonemes that are replaced by noise in a speech signal, based on context.

Example:
- "The *eel is on the axle" (where * represents noise)
- Listeners might perceive "wheel" or "meal" depending on context

This effect demonstrates the importance of top-down processing in speech perception.

### Perceptual Cues

Listeners use various acoustic cues to identify speech sounds:
- Formant transitions for place of articulation
- Voice onset time for voicing in stops
- Duration and spectral cues for vowel identification

Understanding these cues is crucial for designing effective pronunciation training materials.

### Non-Native Speech Perception

Adult learners often have difficulty perceiving and producing non-native phonemic contrasts.

Example:
- Japanese speakers' difficulty distinguishing English /r/ and /l/
- English speakers' difficulty with tonal contrasts in Mandarin Chinese

Theories like the Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM) and the Speech Learning Model (SLM) attempt to explain and predict these difficulties.

## Cross-linguistic Phonetics

Different languages use different sets of speech sounds and phonological rules. Studying these differences is crucial for language learning and linguistic research.

### Phoneme Inventories

Languages vary in the number and types of phonemes they use.

Examples:
- Hawaiian: 13 phonemes (8 consonants, 5 vowels)
- English: ~44 phonemes (24 consonants, 20 vowels including diphthongs)
- !Xóõ (a Khoisan language): ~122 phonemes (including many click consonants)

Typological tendencies:
- All languages have both consonants and vowels
- All languages have stop consonants
- Most languages have nasal consonants
- The most common vowel system is /i a u/

### Phonotactic Constraints

Languages have different rules for allowed sound combinations.

Examples:
- English allows initial consonant clusters like /sp/, /st/, /sk/
- Spanish doesn't allow these initial clusters, often adding an /e/ before them in loanwords (e.g., "stress" → **estrés**)
- Japanese allows only open syllables (CV) or syllables ending in a nasal

Understanding phonotactic constraints can help predict and explain loanword adaptations and common pronunciation errors in second language acquisition.

### Prosodic Features

Languages differ in their use of prosodic features:

1. Stress:
   - Some languages have fixed stress (e.g., Finnish: first syllable, Polish: penultimate syllable)
   - Others have free stress (e.g., Russian, English)

2. Tone:
   - Tonal languages (e.g., Mandarin, Vietnamese) use pitch to distinguish word meanings
   - Non-tonal languages (e.g., English, Spanish) use pitch for intonation and stress

3. Pitch accent:
   - Some languages (e.g., Japanese, Swedish) use pitch accent to distinguish words, but in a more limited way than fully tonal languages

4. Intonation:
   - Languages vary in how they use intonation to express grammatical and pragmatic meanings

Understanding these cross-linguistic differences is essential for effective language teaching and learning.

## Phonetic Transcription Systems

While the IPA is the most comprehensive system, other transcription methods exist for specific purposes:

### Americanist Notation

Used primarily in North American linguistics, it uses familiar Latin characters.

Examples: 
- IPA [ʃ] is represented as [š] in Americanist notation
- IPA [ŋ] is represented as [ṅ] in Americanist notation

### X-SAMPA

A ASCII-compatible version of the IPA, useful for computer applications.

Examples:
- IPA [ʃ] is represented as [S] in X-SAMPA
- IPA [ŋ] is represented as [N] in X-SAMPA

### Phoneme-Grapheme Correspondences

Many languages have their own systems for representing pronunciation based on their orthography:

1. Pinyin for Mandarin Chinese
2. Romaji for Japanese
3. Hangeul for Korean

These systems can be helpful for language learners but may not capture all phonetic details.

## Instrumental Phonetics

Modern phonetic research often involves sophisticated instruments:

### Spectrography

Spectrograms visually represent the frequency components of speech over time.

Applications:
- Analyzing formant structures of vowels
- Studying consonant transitions
- Visualizing intonation patterns

### Electromyography (EMG)

EMG measures muscle activity during speech production.

Applications:
- Studying articulator movements
- Analyzing speech disorders
- Investigating coarticulation

### Ultrasound

Ultrasound imaging can show tongue movements during speech.

Applications:
- Studying articulation of sounds
- Providing visual feedback for language learners
- Analyzing covert articulations

### Electropalatography (EPG)

EPG uses an artificial palate with electrodes to record tongue-palate contact during speech.

Applications:
- Studying articulation disorders
- Analyzing differences in consonant production across languages
- Providing visual feedback for pronunciation training

### Airflow and Pressure Measurements

Devices like pneumotachographs and pressure transducers can measure airflow and pressure during speech.

Applications:
- Studying aerodynamics of speech production
- Analyzing voice disorders
- Investigating differences between speech and singing

These instrumental techniques provide valuable insights into speech production and perception, complementing traditional auditory and articulatory approaches to phonetics.

## Phonetics in Language Learning

Understanding phonetics can greatly benefit language learners:

1. Improved pronunciation: Knowing how sounds are produced helps in articulating them correctly

2. Better listening comprehension: Understanding acoustic properties of sounds aids in distinguishing similar phonemes

3. Accent reduction: Awareness of suprasegmental features helps in adopting native-like prosody

4. Spelling and reading: Knowledge of phoneme-grapheme correspondence assists in reading and spelling unfamiliar words

5. Metalinguistic awareness: Understanding phonetics provides a framework for discussing and analyzing pronunciation

Example exercises for language learners:

1. Minimal pairs practice:
   English learners:
   - **ship** [ʃɪp] vs. **sip** [sɪp]
   - **fan** [fæn] vs. **van** [væn]
   - **right** [raɪt] vs. **light** [laɪt]

2. Phonetic transcription practice:
   Transcribe words or short phrases using the IPA to reinforce sound-symbol correspondences.

3. Tongue twisters:
   Practice difficult sound combinations:
   - "She sells seashells by the seashore"
   - "How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"

4. Intonation patterns:
   Practice different intonation patterns for statements, questions, and commands.

5. Shadow reading:
   Listen to native speakers and try to mimic their pronunciation and intonation in real-time.

6. Phonetic feature analysis:
   Compare and contrast sounds in the target language with similar sounds in the learner's native language.

By incorporating phonetic knowledge and exercises into language learning, students can develop more accurate pronunciation and improve their overall communication skills in the target language.
